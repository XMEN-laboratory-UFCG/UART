.SH Name \fBcreatePhysicalPin\fR \-  Adds a new physical pin-shape to a top-level term (DEF PIN)
.SH Syntax \fBcreatePhysicalPin\fR   [-help]   <pinName>[-allowOutsideBoundary]  [-net <netName>]  [-samePort]  {{ -layer <layerName> {-rect {<x1 y1 x2 y2>} | -polygon {<x1 y1 x2 y2
... xn yn>}}}}  
.P Adds a new physical pin-shape to a top-level term (DEF PIN). You can use this command to add more PG (power/ground) pin-shapes to an existing PG term. It will also create a new PG term if there is not already a PG term.
.P Note: It can add shapes to top-level signal terms, but this is not recommended.  Multiple shapes for a signal term may cause flow problems (the router will not connect the different pin shapes, etc.) and should only be done with expert knowledge of the flow implications. It will not create a new signal term (You must use ECO commands to add a new signal term). 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-allowOutsideBoundary\fR" Do not check whether the specified rectangle is inside the design boundary.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createPhysicalPin parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man createPhysicalPin  "\fB-layer <layerName>\fR" Specifies the LEF (or OA) layer name, or the routing layer index value. For example, 1 for first routing layer, 2 for second routing layer.    Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-net <netName>\fR" Specifies the name of the net.  This is ignored if a top-level term named pinName already exists.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB<pinName>\fR" Specifies the name of the top-level term (DEF PIN) to add shapes to. If it does not exist, then -net <netName> is used to find a top-level term instead. If <netName> does not already have a top-level term, and it is a PG net, then a new term named <pinName> will be created for <netName>.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-polygon {<x1 y1 x2 y2
... xn yn>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of each vertex of the shape.  Data_type: (point)+, optional  "\fB-rect {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the rectangular shape.
.RS  "*" 2 x1 Specifies the lower-left x coordinate, in microns, of the physical pin.  "*" 2 <y1>: Specifies the lower-left y coordinate, in microns, of the physical pin.  "*" 2 <x2>: Specifies the upper-right x coordinate, in microns, of the physical pin.  "*" 2 <y2>: Specifies the upper-right y coordinate, in microns, of the physical pin.
.RE   Data_type: rect, optional  "\fB-samePort\fR" Specifies that the physical pin shapes will be added to the first DEF PORT. If this parameter is not specified, each pin shape is created on a separate DEF port. Normally each PG shape should be on a separate port so each one is connected separately to the PG mesh at the next level up.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds a physical pin-shape to the top-level term named VSS (e.g. DEF PIN named VSS).  createPhysicalPin VSS -layer Metal2 -rect {7 3 17 23}
