.TH checkTimingLibrary  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcheckTimingLibrary\fR \-  Checks the contents of the timing library and reports any inconsistencies in a log file
.SH Syntax  \fBcheckTimingLibrary\fR  [-outfile <string>]   [-cellName <string>]   [-library <string>]   [-checkPower]   [-reportMissingPowerOnly]  
.P Checks the contents of the timing library and reports any inconsistencies in a log file.
.P You can use the checkTimingLibrary command after importing the design and timing libraries. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-cellName <string>\fR" Checks if the timing is defined for all cells with the specified name, in all timing libraries.  Note: In general, the -cellName parameter is optional. However, if you specify the -library parameter, then you must specify -cellName.  "\fB-checkPower\fR" Checks if power constructs are defined for the cells, such as internal_power, leakage_power, or ecsm_power.  Note: In general, the -checkPower parameter is optional. However, if you specify -reportMissingPowerOnly, then you must specify -checkPower. If you use the -library parameter, you do not have to specify the -checkPower parameter, because when a library-specific cell is given as input, the software automatically checks for power constructs.  Default: Only checks if timing is defined for the cells.  "\fB-library <string>\fR" Specifies the timing library in which to check a particular cell. You must specify the -cellName parameter with -library, to specify the particular library cell to check.  Note: If you use the -library parameter, you do not have to specify the -checkPower parameter, because when a library-specific cell is given as input, the software automatically checks for power constructs.  "\fB-outfile <string>\fR" Writes the report to the specified file.  "\fB-reportMissingPowerOnly\fR" Reports only the cells that do not have internal_power (at pin level), or leakage_power defined.  You must specify the -checkPower parameter with the -reportMissingPowerOnly parameter. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if timing is defined for all cells that have been read into the design, and writes a report to the log file:   checkTimingLibrary
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if timing is defined for all cells that have been read into the design, and writes a report to a file named CheckTiming1:   checkTimingLibrary -outfile CheckTiming1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if timing and power constructs are defined for all cells that have been read into the design, and writes the report to the log file:   checkTimingLibrary -checkPower
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if timing and power constructs are defined for all cell that have been read into the design, and writes the report to a file named CheckTiming2:   checkTimingLibrary -outfile CheckTiming2 -checkPower
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if timing is defined for all cells with the name A01 in all timing libraries, and writes the report to a file named CheckTiming3:   checkTimingLibrary -outfile CheckTiming3 -cellName A01
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if timing and power constructs are defined for all cells with the name A01, in all timing libraries, and writes the report to a file named AllA01Check:   checkTimingLibrary -outfile AllA01Check -cellName A01 -checkPower
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if timing and power constructs are defined for the cell with the name A01 in the timing library minFile1.lib, and writes the report to a file named A01Check:   checkTimingLibrary -outfile A01Check -cellName A01 -library minFile1.lib  Note: When you use the -library parameter, you do not have to specify the -checkPower parameter, because when a library-specific cell is given as input, the software automatically checks for power constructs.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks if the internal_power and/or leakage_power constructs are defined for all cells that have been read into the design, and reports only those cells that do not have the constructs defined. The software writes the report to a file named MissingPower:   checkTimingLibrary -outfile MissingPower -checkPower -reportMissingPowerOnly
.RE
