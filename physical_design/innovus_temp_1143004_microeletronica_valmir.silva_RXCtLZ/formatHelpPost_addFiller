.P Inserts filler cell instances in the gaps between standard cell instances. Filler cells provide continuity for the VDD/VSS power rail, as well as for n-wells. In most cases, use this command after placement and before detailed routing. If the design is routed, this command also does DRC checks of the filler cells added to the wires in the design. It does not check adjacent cells. This process ensures that this command is fast enough to be used many times in the design flow.
.P Note: Before using addFiller, run the globalNetConnectcommand to provide global-net-connection rules for supply pins of the added fillers. Without these rules, the built-in design-rule checks of addFiller will not be accurate.
.P To resolve adjacent cell DRC violations created by the insertion of filler cells, run the verify_drc command to mark these violations. Then, use the addFiller command again with the -fixDRC parameter to replace the filler cells that caused the violations.
.P Note: This command resolves only filler-related violations; it cannot resolve net-based violations. To repair net-based violations, reroute the violated nets.
.P The addFiller command recognizes up to eight implant layers and attempts to honor implant layer width and spacing rules within each implant layer. If it does not find the correct filler cell to add to an implant layer, it tries to add "no-implant" filler cells. If it cannot add the "no-implant" cells, it inserts a filler cell that is large enough that it does not violate the minimum width rule of the relevant implant layer.
.P Use the deleteFillercommand to remove the added filler cell instances.
.P Note: This command supports multithreading.    Note: Some addFiller parameters can also be specified with setFillerMode. However, the parameters you specify with addFiller apply to the current addFiller run only, and supersede the parameters set by setFillerMode. For more information, see setFillerMode.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-area <x1y1x2y2>\fR" Adds filler cells to the specified area. If the area is not defined properly, does not add filler cells.  Normally, designs are placed before filler cells are added. However, If you use this parameter and the design is not placed, you get a warning, and the command adds fillers in the specified area.  Note: You can specify this parameter with addFiller only, and not with setFillerMode.
.RS  "*" 2 Specifies the area's lower left point on the x axis.  "*" 2 Specifies the area's lower left point on the y axis.  "*" 2 Specifies the area's upper right point on the x axis.  "*" 2 Specifies the area's upper right point on the y axis.
.RE   "\fB-cell <filler_cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of filler cells to add. Separate filler cell names with spaces and enclose the list with quotation marks (") or curly braces ({}).  Note: Cells specified by this parameter override the list of cells provided by the -core parameter of setFillerMode.  "\fB-createRows {true | false}\fR" Controls whether addFiller creates rows in the floorplan if a cell's site does not have rows. Specify false for this parameter to prevent  addFiller from creating the rows.  Default:  true  "\fB-diffCellViol {true|false}\fR" Checks violations between different cell types.  Default: false  Note: Using this feature will increase the runtime of addFiller.  "\fB-check_signal_drc {true | false}\fR" Controls postroute DRC violation checking against existing net routing, without considering adjacent cell DRC violations.  This parameter does not disable regular placement checks.  Default: true  In 16.10, addFiller has been enhanced with DRC. This flow would fill gaps as much as possible even with DRC, and will give the violation report and marker for easy debug. Also, the -add_fillers_with_drc option has been added to the setFillerMode command to call second addFiller without DRC checking.  If filler cells are added after routing, the software checks for DRC violations between regular nets and the filler cells. When the inserted filler violates the existing routing, addFiller tries to use other filler cells to replace the violating one. If it fails to fill the gap without violation, it will insert a violated filler in the second pass and give the violation report and marker for easy debug when -add_fillers_with_drc is turned on.  "\fB-ecoMode {true | false}\fR" Controls whether the software resolves overlaps of standard cells with fillers by removing the overlapping fillers, and inserting new fillers in any existing or newly created gaps due to partial overlaps in eco flow. If this parameter is used after routing, the command also resolves DRC violations of filler geometries of all fillers with regular wires.  Default: false  "\fB-fitGap\fR" Fills a gap between cells by adding a combination of cells, instead of by adding the single largest cell that fits, if doing so avoids leaving an unfilled single-width gap.   "\fB-fixDRC\fR" Corrects DRC violations reported by verify_drc between filler cells and adjacent standard cells.  Note: The addFiller command resolves only filler-related violations--it cannot resolve net-based violations. To repair net-based violations, reroute the violated nets.  Use this parameter in subsequent runs of the addFiller command, after adding filler cells and checking for violations with verify_drc. The command replaces filler cells that cause DRC violations with fillers that do not cause violations. If it cannot replace a violating filler cell without causing another violation, it leaves a gap.  Note: You can specify this parameter with addFiller only, and not with setFillerMode.  "\fB-fix_horizontal_max_length_violation\fR" Fixes the horizontal max-length violation.   "\fB-fix_vertical_max_length_violation\fR" Fixes the vertical stack max-length violation.   "\fB-honorPrerouteAsObs {true | false}\fR" Instructs addFiller to honor the setting of setPlaceMode -place_detail_preroute_as_obs. That is, when this parameter is true, addFiller treats preroutes on metal layers where filler cells have geometries as obstructions, and ignores preroutes on other layers. In most cases, this means that addFiller treats preroutes on metal1 as obstructions and ignores preroutes on other metal layers. For example, if setPlaceMode -place_detail_preroute_as_obs is set to metal1 and metal2, and all the filler cell geometries are on metal1, addFiller treats metal1 preroutes as obstructions but not metal2 preroutes.  Default: false  addFiller ignores setPlaceMode -place_detail_preroute_as_obs and inserts fillers in all legal sites.  "\fB-markFixed\fR" Places newly added filler cells in FIXED status in the Innovus database.  Note: You can specify this parameter with addFiller only, and not with setFillerMode.  "\fB-merge {true | false}\fR" When checking for spacing violations, merges same-net geometries to determine width-dependent spacing. If the LEF file contains width-dependent rules, this parameter causes addFiller to have the following behavior:
.RS  "*" 2 If you specify true, the command merges overlapping same-net objects to create a large rectangle.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If you specify false, the command uses the shape of the object from the database.
.RE   Default: false  "\fB-minHole {true | false}\fR" Calls verify_drc to check for minimum hole violations before adding filler cells and repairs the violations when  addFiller runs.  Default:  false  "\fB-powerDomain <powerDomainName>\fR" Specifies the power domain in which to add filler cells.  Default: If this parameter is not specified, and a list of filler cells is specified with the -cell parameter, the addFiller command tries to add fillers to all power domains.  Note: You can specify this parameter with addFiller only, and not with setFillerMode.  "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Specifies the prefix for the placed instances.  Default: FILLER  "\fB-prevent_vertical_stack_max_length_violation\fR" Adds a repair endcap cell to cut the vertical stack of endcap cells to prevent its vertical  max-length violation.  "\fB-util <targetUtilization>\fR" Specifies the percent of free space remaining after placement to fill with given filler cell instances.  Use -util to add gate-array core filler cells to use later in the design flow, along with gate-array core cells, for metal-only mask changes.  Note: You can specify this parameter with addFiller only, and not with setFillerMode.  Range: More than 0.0 (0%) and equal to or less than 1.0 (100%)  Default: 1.0  "\fB[-viaEnclosure {true | false}]\fR" Calls verify_drc to check for via enclosure violations before adding filler cells and repairs the violations when addFiller runs.  Default: false
