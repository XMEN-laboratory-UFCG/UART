.P When used on designs with clock tree source group definitions, this command assigns clock sinks to the source group roots - multi-tap assignment - and then performs the cloning and rewiring necessary to distribute the sinks among the source group roots.
.P Note that the source group assignment process normally happens automatically during the early stages of clock tree synthesis. However, on large designs, the full clock tree synthesis step can take some time. The purpose of this command is to provide an easier way to get early feedback about the multi-tap assignment process, visualize the result, adjust source group definitions, and so on.
.P By default, the command will do initial clock gate merging and then clone as necessary to implement the assignment. However, the merging step can be disabled by specifying the -no_merge option. If no source groups are defined, the command will do nothing.
.P After running the command, you can review the log file messages, or check the result in the database either by using the Tcl commands, clock tree debugger, and so on. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help       \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each assign_clock_tree_source_groups parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man assign_clock_tree_source_groups.   "\fB-no_merge<>  \fR" Specifies that clock gates should not be merged.
