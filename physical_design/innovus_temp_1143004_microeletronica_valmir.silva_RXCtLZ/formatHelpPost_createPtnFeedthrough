.SH Name \fBcreatePtnFeedthrough\fR \-  Creates a partition routing feedthrough object
.SH Syntax \fBcreatePtnFeedthrough\fR  [-help]  <feedBox>   [<layerId>]   [-name <string>]  
.P Creates a partition routing feedthrough object. The object area keeps pins from being created on the specified metal layer. A dump file with routing obstruction is created for the top level partition (done when saving the partition). You can use this command during partition floorplanning. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createPtnFeedthrough parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man createPtnFeedthrough  "\fB<feedBox>\fR" Specifies the coordinates  (x1 y1 x2 y2 ) of the feedthrough area.  Data_type: rect, optional  "\fB<layerId>\fR" Specifies the metal layer where pins are not to be created.  Note: If<layerId> is not specified then by default feed-through is created on all the partition layers.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-name <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the routing feedthrough.  Data_type: string, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command creates a feedthrough object to block pins being generated on layer Metal5:
