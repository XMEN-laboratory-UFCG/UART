.SH Name \fBanalyze_ir_paths\fR
.SH Syntax \fBanalyze_ir_paths\fR   [-help]  -clock_period <float>  [-hierarchical_activity_file <string>]  [-max_slack <float>]  [-pre_simulation_period <float>]  -seq_activity <float>  -simulation_period <float>  [-user_defined_critical_paths <string>]  Generates a physical-aware multi-cycle switching activity file containing toggle information of voltage sensitive paths as well as timing critical paths in the design for Tempus Power Integrity analysis. This command generates 'swsrc.txt' file in the run directory, which then is fed back to the software using the read_activity_file command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-clock_period <float>\fR" Specifies the period of dominant clock of the design in library time units. Tempus PI refers to this specified period for multi-cycle activity generation.  "\fB-hierarchical_activity_file <string>\fR" Provides a mechanism for different sequential activity for several partitions in the design. The following is the required format:  <hierarchical instance 1> <activity>  <hierarchical instance 2> <activity> 
...  "\fB-max_slack <float>\fR" Specifies the maximum slack limit in library time units, above which the timing paths are not considered for activity generation.  "\fB-pre_simulation_period <float>\fR" Specifies the pre-simulation duration that will be used by Tempus PI for activity generation.  This parameter is useful when package model information is read-in using set_package command, as it allows the package oscillations to settle down.  Note: The value specified must match to value specified under set_rail_analysis_mode -record_results_start_time setting.  "\fB-seq_activity <float>\fR" Specifies the activity of sequential endpoints in the design. This value will be used to control the number of IR sensitive paths, along with their fanout cone, to toggle in each cycle.  "\fB-simulation_period <float>\fR" Specifies the simulation period in library time units that Tempus PI dynamic power analysis will use. The larger the simulation period, the more will be the number of paths covered in the analysis.  The following formula can be used to set the simulation period:  sim_cycles = (2/seq_act)*N  Where,
.RS  "*" 2 seq_act is the input sequential activity (e.g., 0.05, 0.1 etc.)  "*" 2 N is the number of nworst paths to be covered per endpoint  "*" 2 sim_period is equal to the sim_cycles*<time period of dominant clock>
.RE   It is recommended to have N>=1, that is, at least one path per endpoint should be scheduled in the analysis.  "\fB-user_defined_critical_paths <string>\fR" Specifies a collection of timing paths that are to be prioritized for toggling while generating Tempus PI activity.   This feature is useful when designers have prior information on certain timing paths that may switch together and can potentially cause IR-induced STA violations. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates the activity file for design with dominant clock of 2GHz, with input sequential activity being 0.1 and simulation duration being 20ns:  analyze_ir_paths -seq_activity 0.1 -simulation_period 20 -clock_period 0.5  "*" 2 The following example specifies different sequential activity for different hierarchical partitions, with 0.2 sequential activity for unspecified partitions and top:  analyze_ir_paths -seq_activity 0.2 -simulation_period 30 -clock_period 0.5 -hierarchical_activity_file hact.txt  Contents of 'hact.txt':  hierA/inst1 0.25  hierB/inst2 0.15  "*" 2 The following command specifies the pre-simulation duration, particularly useful for package oscillations to settle when package models have been read-in:  analyze_ir_paths -seq_activity 0.1 -simulation_period 30 -clock_period 0.5 -pre_simulation_period 10
