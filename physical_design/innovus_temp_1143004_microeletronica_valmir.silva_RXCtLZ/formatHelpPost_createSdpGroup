.P Creates an SDP group. The added object can be an instance or another SDP group.
.P The createSdpGroup command enables you to create a structured data path using TCL commands. You do not need to learn SDP relative placement syntax for creating a data path.
.P Before creating an SDP group, you should have:

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each createSdpGroup parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man createSdpGroup.  "\fB-inst <WCardName>...\fR" Specifies one or more instance names. Use this parameter if you want to create the SDP group from the specified instances. You can additionally specify -keepOrder if you want the tool to honor the order in which SDP instance are specified in the list.  Note: Wildcards can be used to specify the instance names.  "\fB-justifyBy {SW|SE|NW|NE|N|W|S|E|MID}\fR" Specifies the anchor point that will be used to align the SDP group you are creating.  Default: SW  "\fB-keepOrder\fR" Honors the order of instances in the SDP instance list that you specify as input with the -inst parameter.  "\fB-name <sdpGroupName>\fR" Specifies the name of the SDP group you are creating.  "\fB-numCol <value>\fR" Indicates the number of columns to be created.  "\fB-numRow <value>\fR" Indicates the number of rows to be created.  Note: If you specify both -numRow and -numCol, use the -type parameter to specify the parent structure type (row or col). If you do not specify type, the default parent structure will be column.  "\fB-selected\fR" Indicates that you want to create the SDP group from the current set of selected instances.  If the selected cells are already placed and you specify neither the -numRow or -numCol options nor the -type option, the command will automatically generate one column with rows where the SDP structure will be based on the physical location of the selected cells. The tool will print the following message to indicate that the SDP structure created will be derived from the physical location of the selected cells:  Command is running with physical mode extraction where SDP structure will be derived from the existing physical cell placement.  If the selected cells are not yet placed or if some of the selected cells are placed while others are not, the tool prints a message indicating that SDP physical mode extraction cannot be activated and SDP structure cannot be derived from the existing physical placement because the selected instance is not placed.  "\fB-skip_space <value>\fR" Specifies a space value to be skipped. By default, if -skip_space is defined in a column, its value represents the number of skipped rows. If -skip_space is defined in a row, its value is for column skipping and represents the number of M2 tracks (pitch of first vertical layer).   Skip space value can also be specified as number of widths of a specified row site by using the -skip_space_by_site_width <value> <siteName> parameter. However, row site width should be specified only for an SDP row, and not for an SDP column.  Alternatively, you can specify the -skip_space_by_micron parameter to specify the distance to be skipped in microns (um).  Note: Use the -skip_space parameter with the -type space option to add row/column spaces.  "\fB-skip_space_by_micron <value>\fR" Specifies the space value to be skipped in microns (um). If the specified distance value is not equal to the exact number of first vertical metal pitches or number of rows, createSdpGroup rounds off the value.  Note: This option cannot be used with either -skip_space or -skip_space_by_site_width.  "\fB-skip_space_by_site_width <value> <siteName>\fR" Specifies the number of row/column space to be skipped and the name of the tech site. Uses the width of the specified site as the skip unit in the horizontal direction.  Note: This option cannot be used with either -skip_space or -skip_space_by_micron.  "\fB-spread_group <value>  \fR" Inserts space between group of instances. If -spread_group is specified in a column, spacing will be the number of added rows. If  -spread_group is specified in a row, spacing will be the number of placement grids added between the columns in that row.   "\fB-spread_group_by_micron <value>\fR" Specifies the space to be inserted between groups of instances in microns (um).  Note: This option cannot be used with either-spread_group or -spread_group_by_site_width.  "\fB-spread_group_by_site_width <value> <siteName>\fR" Specifies the number of row/column space to be inserted and the name of the tech site. Uses the width of the specified site as the spread unit in the horizontal direction.  Note: This option cannot be used with either -spread_group or -spread_group_by_micron.  "\fB-type {row|col|space}\fR" Indicates whether the new group is a row, column, or an empty (skipped) space.  Default: col 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following example creates an SDP group named TestGrp of type space with two spaces:   createSdpGroup -name TestGrp -type space -skip_space 2
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example creates an SDP group named sdpGrp1 of type row with four columns from the selected instances. The group is aligned in the South East direction:  createSdpGroup -name sdpGrp1 -type row -justifyBy SE -numCol 4 -selected
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example creates a row data path that has three columns, each with two rows, for all the instances that have name matched the pattern DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST*:  createSdpGroup -name sdp_group1 -type row -inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST* -numRow 2 -numCol 3  "*" 2 The following command automatically generates one column with rows where the SDP structure will be based on the physical location of the selected cells, provided that the selected cells are already placed:   createSdpGroup -selected -name group2
