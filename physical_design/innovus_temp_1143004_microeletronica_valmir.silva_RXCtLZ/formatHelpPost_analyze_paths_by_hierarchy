.P Creates categories according to the hierarchical characteristics of the paths. User can use either a user specified floorplan file or current floorplan file of the design in memory and can create categories according to the hierarchy of the design. This way, the paths can be narrowed down to small group. 
.SH Use Floorplan Plan:
.P The software automatically extracts partition-boundary information from guides, regions, and fences in the floorplan file. Optionally you can specify option to sort paths based on the macros in the floorplan file.
.RS  "*" 2 All paths fully contained in a single partition, Ptn1.  "*" 2 Paths starting in one partition and ending in another partition, Ptn1->Ptn2.  "*" 2 Paths spanning several partitions, Ptn1-> Ptn2->Ptn3.  "*" 2 Top-level inputs to partitions, INPUT->Ptn1.  "*" 2 Paths from partitions to top-level outputs, Ptn1->OUTPUT.
.RE 
.SH Use Current Floorplan:
.P This method categorizes paths based on the current floorplan of the design in memory. It will rely on the grouped/ungrouped as a basis for what level to view the hierarchy as well as what levels to create timing categories
.
.P Grouped/ungrouped status of an Hinst means whether or not its children are shown on the floorplan view.
.P It categorizes paths starting and ending on/within these hierarchical entities:
.RS  "*" 2 Port  "*" 2 Hard Macro (ungrouped)  "*" 2 Black Box (ungrouped)  "*" 2 Hinst (regular, partition, Black Blob, or Flex Model) (highest grouped)  "*" 2 Stdcell (ungrouped)

.SH Examples:
.RS  "*" 2  By default, it categorizes all the paths inter/intra in the 5 hierarchical entities by following command :   analyze_paths_by_hierarchy -use_current_floorplan -all
.RE
.RS  "*" 2  The following command categorizes all paths from "port" or to "port":   analyze_paths_by_hierarchy -use_current_floorplan -type port
