.SH Name \fBadd_gate_array_filler\fR \-  Inserts GA filler cells with regular pattern during the pre-place stage. 
.P The GA filler cells created by this command are marked as physical-only cells
.SH Syntax \fBadd_gate_array_filler\fR   [-help]   [-allow_shift_distance <x> <y>]  [-area <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>]  [-cell_orientation {R0|MX|MY|R180}]  [-offsetx <offset_in_microns>]   [-offsety <offset_in_microns>]   [-powerDomain <powerDomainName>]   [-prefix <prefixName>]   {-cell <cellName> -stepx <step_in_microns> -stepy <step_in_microns>} 
.P Inserts GA filler cells with regular pattern during the pre-place stage. 
.P The GA filler cells created by this command are marked as physical-only cells. This means that the isPhysOnly attribute of these GA filler cells is set to true. This is a prerequisite for the ecoPlace -useGAFillerCells command to map the unplaced ECO cells to the added GA filler cells, in case of a GA filler-based post-mask ECO. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-allow_shift_distance <x> <y>\fR" Specifies the distance between the new and the original position in the x and y directions.  If you do not specify -allow_shift_distance, the GA filler will be removed if it is added at original location with a violation. If -allow_shift_distance is specified, the GA can be shifted to avoid violation. If a GA filler cannot be added at the original location because of the violation, it will be moved to the left side, right side, upside, or downside of the original location to ensure that there is no violation. The next filler keeps the step value with the original position of the moved filler.  "\fB-area <x1 y1 x2 y2>\fR" Specifies the area in which GA fillers are to be inserted. If no area is specified, GA fillers will be inserted for the complete core area.  "\fB-cell <cellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the filler cell to be used.   "\fB-cell_orientation {R0|MX|MY|R180}\fR" Specifies all legal orientations of GFILL instances.   "\fB-offsetx <offset_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the offset, in microns, from the origin in the horizontal direction. If the -area parameter is specified, the origin is (x1, y1) of the box defined by  -area. If  -area is not specified the origin is (0,0).   "\fB-offsety <offset_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the offset, in microns, from the origin in the vertical direction. If the -area parameter is specified, the origin is (x1, y1) of the box defined by  -area. If  -area is not specified the origin is (0,0).   "\fB-powerDomain powerDomainName\fR" Specifies the power domain for which fillers are to be inserted.   "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Specifies the prefix for the inserted GA filler cells.   "\fB-stepx <step_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance between GA fillers in the horizontal direction.   "\fB-stepy <step_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance between GA fillers in the vertical direction 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds GA fillers of type GAFILL4 with spacing in horizontal and vertical direction of 20 microns. The first GAFILL4 will be placed at (10, 0).  add_gate_array_filler -cell GAFILL4 -stepx 20 -stepy 20 -offsetx 10
