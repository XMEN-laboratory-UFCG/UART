.TH addEndCap  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBaddEndCap\fR \-  Adds physical-only end cap cells at the ends of the site rows
.SH Syntax \fBaddEndCap\fR  [-help]   [-area llx lly urx ury]   [-coreBoundaryOnly]   [-powerDomain <powerDomainName>]   [-prefix <prefixName>]
.P Adds physical-only end cap cells at the ends of the site rows. A single-height cap cell is required at the end of each row. For deep N-well technology, the command can be used to insert row-caps to isolate p-well from top and bottom. Use setEndCapMode to specify the row-cap cells. For deep N-well technology, addEndCap also gets the end cap list from LEF if the end cap cell is specified with the following MACRO CLASS, but user definition has higher priority than LEF specification.
.P [CLASS ENDCAP {   | TOPEDGE | BOTTOMEDGE | LEFTEDGE | RIGHTEDGE    | LEFTTOPEDGE | RIGHTTOPEDGE    | LEFTBOTTOMEDGE | RIGHTBOTTOMEDGE   | LEFTTOPCORNER | RIGHTTOPCORNER    | LEFTBOTTOMCORNER | RIGHTBOTTOMCORNER}   } ]
.P Note: addEndCap is always called after floorplan is done and before addWellTap.
.P Note: End cap insertion honors core boundary, power domain boundary, placement blockage, fixed macro, and fixed macro halo
.P To delete the end cap cells, use the deleteFiller command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-area llx lly urx ury\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the bounding box, in microns. By default, the core box that encloses all core rows is used.   "\fB-coreBoundaryOnly\fR" Specifies that end-cap cells are placed only within the core boundary. This ensures that end-cap cells do not get placed at locations where site rows are obstructed by blockages.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each addEndCap parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man addEndCap.  "\fB-powerDomain <powerDomainName>\fR" Specifies the power domain in which the end-cap cells are inserted. This identifies the area where to place the end-cap cells and connect to the correct power and ground nets.   "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Specifies the prefix for the placed instances. The generated name for the instance uses this prefix as prefix_<uniqueString>.  Prefix Default: ENDCAP  Note: Do not use an underscore at the end of the prefix name.
.P Note: If the given leftEdge cell is the same as the rightEdge cell, and the cell and site symmetries allow it, the postCap instances will be flipped in the Y direction. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command preplaces cell abc at the beginning of each site row of the design, and cell xyz at the end of each site row of the design in R0 orientation, and adds the prefix PwrCap for the placed instances.   setEndCapMode -leftEdge abc -rightEdge xyz; addEndCap -prefix PwrCap
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes all physical-only cells with the prefix PwrCap. As a result, all cells created in the previous example are deleted from the design.   deleteFiller -prefix PwrCap
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command preplaces cell abc at the beginning and end of each site row of the design and, if site symmetry allows, flips the post-cap cell in Y direction. Thus, for N-oriented rows, placed pre-cap cell is in N orientation, and post-cap cell is in FN orientation.   setEndCapMode -leftEdge abc -rightEdge abc; addEndCap -prefix PwrCap
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command, in which the pre-cap cell is the same as the post-cap cell, places pre-cap cells in FN orientation and post-cap cells in N orientation in N-oriented rows, if site symmetry allows:   setEndCapMode -leftEdge abc -rightEdge abc -flipY; addEndCap -prefix PwrCap
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command flips both the pre-cap and post-cap cell in Y direction. This preplaces both cells abc and xyz in FN orientation in N-oriented rows:   setEndCapMode -leftEdge abc -rightEdge xyz -flipY; addEndCap -prefix PwrCap
