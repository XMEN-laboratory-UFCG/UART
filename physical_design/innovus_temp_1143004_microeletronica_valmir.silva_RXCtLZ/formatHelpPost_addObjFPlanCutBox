.SH Name \fBaddObjFPlanCutBox\fR \-  Specifies the rectilinear shape of floorplan objects by describing the cut out area
.SH Syntax \fBaddObjFPlanCutBox\fR   [-help]  type   name   boxlist
.P Specifies the rectilinear shape of floorplan objects by describing the cut out area. The floorplan objects include block top cell, module constraint (guide, region, fence), layershape, pin, net, group, and instance. The command creates a rectilinear cut box for an object. A rectilinear object is comprised of two or more boxes. To use this command, divide the required cut out area into one or more bounding boxes and specify the coordinates of each bounding box in the command. Once you run the command, the rectilinear cut area disappears from the object after a redraw. You can use the command at any point in the design flow. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each addObjFPlanCutBox parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man addObjFPlanCutBox  "\fB<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the object for type.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB<type>\fR" Specifies the type of object for name. This can be:
.RS  "*" 2 Cell  "*" 2 Group  "*" 2 Instance  "*" 2 Layershape  "*" 2 Module  "*" 2 Net  "*" 2 Pin
.RE   Data_type: string, required   "\fB<boxList>\fR" Specifies the rectilinear shape of an object. The  box list must be specified in the following format: {{x1 y1 x2 y2}
....}  Data_type: list, required 
.SH Example
.P The following example defines the rectilinear shape of the module module_A by specifying 2 rectilinear cut boxes defined by coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), and (x4, y4).  addObjFPlanCutBox Module module_A {{x1 y1 x2 y2} {x3 y3 x4 y4}}
