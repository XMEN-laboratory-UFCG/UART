.SH Name \fBcalculate_ccopt_cannot_clone_reason\fR \-  Returns a Tcl list of reasons why the specified instance cannot be cloned in CTS
.SH Syntax \fBcalculate_ccopt_cannot_clone_reason\fR  [-help]  -inst <instName>
.P Returns a Tcl list of reasons why the specified instance cannot be cloned in CTS. An empty list indicates the given instance can be cloned. This command is similar to the CCOpt property, cannot_clone_reason but it can be used before running ccopt_design.
.P It differs from the property, cannot_clone_reason in that it always calculates the reason as compared to just retrieving a saved property value from the last time that cloning happened. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help       \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each calculate_ccopt_cannot_clone_reason parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man calculate_ccopt_cannot_clone_reason.   "\fB-inst <instName>  \fR" Specifies the name of the instance for which you want to know the reason for being uncloneable.
