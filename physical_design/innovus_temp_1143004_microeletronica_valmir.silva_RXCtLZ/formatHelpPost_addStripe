.P Creates power stripes within the specified area. If the router encounters an obstruction, the stripe connects to the last stripe on the same net. Otherwise, the stripes stop at the core row boundary. Use this command after creating an initial floorplan.  
.SH Adding Stripes in Multi-Threading Mode
.P You can generate stripes in multi-threading mode by using the following command before addStripe:  setMultiCpuUsage
.P When the specified CPU number is bigger than the estimated CPU number, addStripe uses the estimated CPU number for multi-threading. Otherwise, it uses the specified CPU number.
.P Estimated CPU number = (free memory - 512 MB)/(added memory*2)
.P If any of the following options are specified, addStripe will internally disable the multi-threading mode:
.RS  "*" 2 {-over_bumps {0 | 1} | -between_bumps {0 | 1}} | -over_pins {0 | 1} -pin_layer layer {-master master_cells | -all_blocks}}  "*" 2 UDM global variable pwStripeRouteOverRowsOnly is equal to 1
.RE
.P addStripe supports the new setMultiCpuUsage command use model. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each addStripe parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man addStripe  "\fB-all_blocks {0 | 1}\fR" Specifies that stripes should be generated over all blocks.  Default: 0  "\fB-allow_snapping_override_custom_spacing {0 | 1}\fR" When set to 1, it allows snapping of stripes overriding the specified spacing to the closest track. If the closest track has conflicts, the stripe is removed.  When set to 0, it snaps the stripes in the first set to the inward direction, and the other stripes to the closest track. This parameter keeps the actual spacing greater than or equal to the specified spacing.  Default: 0  "\fB-area{{<x1 y1 x2 y2>}{<x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4>
...}
...}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the design area in which the stripes must be created. The -x_left_offset and -x_right_offset values are measured from this boundary area for vertical stripes, and the -y_top_offset and -y_bottom_offset values are measured from this boundary area for horizontal stripes.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 If a core ring exists in the design, the stripes automatically connect to the core ring if you do not use the -area parameter. You can also create stripes in an area defined by a polygon (rectilinear). For example:  addStripe -area {100 100 100 200 150 200 150 150 200 150 200 100}  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, stripes are created for the entire core box.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 -area and -extend_to design_boundary are mutually exclusive. The following error is issued on them being used together:  You cannot specify stripes over design boundary and set an area constraint. Instead, specify area to cover design boundary.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 -area and -extend_to first_padring/last_padring are mutually exclusive. The following error is issued on them being used together:  You cannot specify stripes over padring and set an area constraint. Instead, specify area to cover padring.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When this parameter is used with setAddStripeMode -domain_offset_from_core true, the -start_offset value for specified area is measured from core on using addStripe -area.
.RE   "\fB-area_blockage {{<x1 y1 x2 y2>}{<x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4>
...}
...}\fR" Specifies the blockage coordinates to restrict the addition of any stripes to this region.  This parameter supports rectangular and rectilinear area_blockages. Their spacing is 0 during stripe generation.  Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Rectangular area_blockage:  -area_blockage {100 100 200 200}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Rectilinear area_blockage:  -area_blockage {100 100 100 200 150 200 150 150 200 150 200 100}
.RE   You can add multiple blockages at the same time.  Rectangular areas or rectilinear area or their mixture can be specified. For multiple areas, each of them must be inside brace.  Examples
.RS  "*" 2 multiple rectangles
.RE   -area_blockage {{x1 y1 x2 y2} {a1 b1 a2 b2}
...}
.RS  "*" 2 multiple rectilinear area
.RE   -area_blockage {{x1 y1 x2 y2
... } {a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3
...}
...}
.RS  "*" 2 mixture of them
.RE   -area_blockage {{x1 y1 x2 y2} {a1 b1 a2 b2}
... {x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
...} {a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3
...}
...}  The specified areas that are not included inside brace will be ignored. For example  -area_blockage {{x1 y1 x2 y2} a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3
... {c1 d1 c2 d2 c3 d3
...}}  {x1 y1 x2 y2} and {c1 d1 c2 d2 c3 d3
...} will be used, and a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3
... are ignored  "\fB-between_bumps {0 | 1}\fR" Specifies that stripes should be generated between bumps.  Default: 0  "\fB-block_ring_bottom_layer_limit<layer_name>\fR" Specifies the lowest layer that stripes can switch to when encountering a block ring. Stripes that encounter a block ring can only switch to this layer or higher.  "\fB-block_ring_top_layer_limit <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the highest layer that stripes can switch to when encountering a block ring. Stripes that encounter a block ring can only switch to this layer or lower.  "\fB-create_pins {0 | 1}\fR" If set to 1, IO pins are created for each stripe. Any overlap with existing IO pins at the design boundary is flagged as a warning after the stripes are created. If set to 0, pins are not created.  By default, addStripe would create pins for any stripe touching the design boundary. When -extend_to  design_boundary is used the option -create_pins is 1 by default.  "\fB-direction {horizontal | vertical}\fR" Sets the stripe direction.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, vertical stripes are created.  "\fB-extend_to\fR" The boundary for the stripes. Specify one of the following values:  all_domains  Stripes are created over all power domains for each power and ground net within each power domain. Stripes start and stop at each power domain boundary or ring around the power domain, and ignore the values in the -nets parameter.  first_padring  Stripes are created within the area enclosed by the pad ring closest to the core area.  last_padring              Stripes are created within the area enclosed by the pad ring closest to the design boundary.  design_boundary  Stripes are created within the design boundary  "\fB-insts <instance_name>\fR" Specifies the instance name for generating power stripes.   "\fB-layer <layer>\fR" Specifies the name of the layer in which to create stripes. Stripes can be created on only one layer at a time.  The following types of formulas are supported:
.RS  "*" 2  Lefname  "*" 2  Metal layer number
.RE   Example:   If Metal2 is named by 'MET2' in LEF file, then you can use
.RS  "*" 2  MET2  "*" 2  2
.RE   to identify metal2.  "\fB-master <master_cells>\fR" Specifies the instances of the standard cell (or block) masters over which stripes should be generated.  The option supports regular expression: ? matches any single characters and * matches any sequence of characters.  "\fB-max_same_layer_jog_length<value>\fR" The maximum length, in micrometers, that a stripe can jog on the same layer before switching to an adjacent layer. For example, if you specify a value of 2 micrometers, and an obstruction causes a stripe on layer METAL4 to jog for 3 micrometers, the jog will occur on layer METAL3 or METAL5. However, if an obstruction causes the stripe to jog for only 1 micrometer, the jog occurs on layer METAL4.  Default: 2 (If you do not specify this parameter, the stripe automatically switches to an adjacent layer if the jog length is two times the width of the stripe.)  "\fB-merge_stripes_value <value>\fR" Merges a stripe with a nearby block ring if the threshold spacing between the stripe and ring is smaller than the <value>(in micrometers) specified with this parameter. The stripe jogs to connect to the nearby ring only on the stripe layer.  Note: To prevent stripes from merging with block rings, set the value of this parameter to  1.  Default: 10 (If you do not specify this parameter, stripes do not jog to merge with rings that are more than 10 m away.)  To merge the stripe on all layers, set the following variable of the setAddStripeMode command:   -merge_with_all_layers 1  "\fB-narrow_channel {0 | 1}\fR" Generates stripes over narrow channel area. Narrow channel usually exists between two blocks/power domains, or between core boundary and blocks/power domains. If there are part of rows without a certain net and layer of power mesh crossing over, the area of neighboring part of rows is defined as a narrow channel for that net and layer. When adding overall stripes, some narrow channels might be missed because of start offset and set to set distance. In this circumstance, adding stripes in narrow channel can help to supply power to stdcells in that channel. The recommended flow is to add overall stripes first and then to add stripes in narrow channel, if needed.  Default : 0  Examples of narrow channels:  Narrow potential channels for vertical stripes  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Narrow potential channels for horizontal stripes  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note: This parameter can be used with the -power_domains and -over_power_domain parameters.  The -narrow_channel parameter generates stripes with uniform channel width in both the vertical and horizontal directions, if the -number_of_sets parameter is set to an integer value greater than 1. The added wires are created at the channel evenly, as shown below:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   If the -start_offset parameter is used for specifying the starting offset value before the above setting of the -narrow_channel parameter, and the specified offset location has a DRC, the added wire shifts to the left or up to the closed DRC clean location, as shown below:  addStripe -width $W -spacing $spacing -number_of_sets N -narrow_channel 1 -nets {$net1 $net2
...}
...  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   If the -start_offset parameter is not used before the above setting of the -narrow_channel parameter, the wires are added to the center of the channel. With this setting:
.RS  "*" 2 When the -number_of_sets parameter is set to 1, this center has the same distance from the channel boundaries, as shown below:  addStripe -width $W -spacing $spacing -number_of_sets 1 -narrow_channel 1 -nets {$net1 $net2
...}
...  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 When the -number_of_sets parameter is set to an integer value (N) greater than 1, addStripe calculates the pitch to evenly distribute the PG in the channel.  Pitch: P = Length / N  Additionally, the two PG stripes set at the edge of the channel are at the same distance from the middle of the PG set and the channel boundary is at P/2, as shown below:  addStripe -width $W -spacing $spacing -number_of_sets $N -narrow_channel 1 -nets {$net1 $net2
...}
...  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE   "\fB-nets {<list_of_nets>}\fR" Specifies the names of the nets for which stripes are to be created. The number of net names determines the number of stripes within each set of stripes. The first net in the name list is created first and corresponds to the left or bottom stripe of the set. Separate multiple net names with a space and enclose the list in curly braces, for example, -nets {net1 net2 net3  net3}. Braces are not required for one name.  "\fB-number_of_sets <integer>\fR" Specifies the number of stripe sets to be created. You must specify either this parameter or the -set_to_set_distance parameter.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the number of sets is derived from the -set_to_set_distance parameter.  "\fB-over_bumps {0 | 1}\fR" Specifies that stripes should be generated over bumps.  Default: 0  "\fB-over_physical_pins {0 | 1}\fR" Adds stripes over the physical pins to detect the physical PG terminals and add stripes to continue them. Following is the use modelof this option:  addStripe -over_physical_pins 1 -nets {net_names} -width {pin_width|width_value} -direction {vertical|horizontal} [-pin_layer Mx] [-pin_offset offset_value]  While using this option:
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 The tool generates one stripe on one physical pin separately, except for the following special cases:
.RS  "*" 2 When two same net pins (left and right) are totally aligned. In this case, one stripe between two pins is generated.  "*" 2 When two different net pins are partially or totally aligned. In this case, one stripe on left/bottom pin is generated and break at right/up pin with DRC clean distance.
.RE  "*" 2 -width pin_width makes stripe width same as that of related physical P/G pin.  "*" 2 When offset_value in -pin_offset offset_value is greater than zero, stripes shift up for left/right pins and right for up/down pins.  "*" 2 If both -over_physical_pins and -over_pin are specified, -over_physical_pins is ignored.
.RE 
.RE   In the following example, stripes are added over the physical pins in the horizontal direction for the vdd and vss nets:  addStripe -over_physical_pins 1 -nets {VDD VSS} -width 10 -direction horizontal -pin_layer metal11  Following is the block-level design of the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-over_pins {0 | 1}\fR" Specifies that stripes should be generated over power/ground pins in a standard cell or block.  Default: 0  Note: With this option, user could define value "pin_width" in option "-width", then tool will generate stripe according to pin width automatically.  "\fB-over_power_domain {0 | 1} \fR" If set to 1, adds stripes only within power domain boundaries or the fence around a soft block. For power domains, these stripes start and stop at the power ring that surrounds the selected power domain boundary. For fences, these stripes start and stop at the fence. If both a power domain and a fence are selected, the power domain takes precedence.If you do not specify this parameter or if you specify it with a value of 0, stripes are prevented from extending to the power domain boundary.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 When this option is specified, you can use -start_from {bottom | top | left | right} and -start_offset parameters to set boundaries, but you cannot use the -start and -stop parameters to specify an absolute location.  "*" 2 In addition, the software issues a warning message if the specified power and ground nets do not match the power domain's power or ground nets.  "*" 2 When addStripe -over_power_domain 1 is used with setAddStripeMode -domain_offset_from_core true, the -start_offset value for the selected power domain/block is measured from core on using addStripe -over_power_domain 1.
.RE   Default: 0  "\fB-padcore_ring_bottom_layer_limit<layer_name>\fR" Specifies the lowest layer that stripes can switch to when encountering a pad or core ring. Stripes that encounter a pad or core ring can only switch to this layer or higher.  "\fB-padcore_ring_top_layer_limit<layer_name>\fR" Specifies the highest layer that stripes can switch to when encountering a pad or core ring. Stripes that encounter a pad or core ring can only switch to this layer or lower.  "\fB-pin_layer<layer>\fR" Specifies the layer on which the stripe is generated.  Note: The layer you specify with this parameter is the same as the layer you specify with the -layer parameter.  Default: TOP  "\fB-pin_offset\fR" Offsets the stripe a specified distance from the pin edge to make well tap cell connections. The offset is from the left edge of the stripe to the left edge of the same net pin. This can be a negative number and is in user units.  "\fB-pin_width {<min_value max_value>}\fR" Specifies the range of minimum and maximum pin width for -over_pins or  -over_physical_pins.   "\fB-power_domains <domain_name>\fR" Specifies the power domain name for generating power stripes.  Note: This parameter cannot be used with the -narrow_channel parameter. Use the -area parameter to generate -narrow_channel stripes over certain areas.  "\fB-report_cut_stripe <filename>\fR" Saves the information related to a cut stripe in a DRC file. This helps in identifying the power stripe that has been removed/cut from the design to avoid any DRC violation following user settings.  You can use the following command to load the generated DRC file into the design and view the cut stripe mark in the GUI:  loadDrc *.drc  The following example shows how the information related to a cut stripe is stored in the a.drc file:  addStripe -report_cut_stripe a.drc  The following figure depicts that the place highlighted in red circle will be marked, because here the VSS stripe is cut to avoid short violation to VDD segment:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-same_layer_target_only\fR" Specifies connection to overlapping targets on the same layer only.   "\fB-set_to_set_distance <real>\fR" Specifies the distance (pitch) from the reference stripe of one set to the reference stripe of the next set. The value of this parameter must be a positive number specified in micrometers. You must specify either this parameter or the -number_of_sets parameter.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the distance between sets is derived from the -number_of_sets parameter.  "\fB-snap_wire_center_to_grid {None | Grid | Mask1_Grid | Mask2_Grid | Half_Grid | Either}\fR" Controls the snapping of the center of the stripes. If you do not specify this parameter, stripes are not snapped to the routing grid.  Note: When tech LEF specifies RIGHTWAYONGRIDONLY on a specific layer, stripes are automatically snapped to the routing grid.  Specify one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 None: Does no snapping of the wires.  "*" 2 Grid: Snaps the center of the wire to the routing grid of the same layer as the wire.  "*" 2 Mask1_Grid: Snaps the center of the wire to the routing track of Mask1.  "*" 2 Mask2_Grid: Snaps the center of the wire to the routing track of Mask2
.  "*" 2 Half_Grid: Snaps the center of the wire to the half-routing grid. The half-routing grid is a virtual grid with the tracks at the center of every two adjacent tracks of the routing grid.  "*" 2 Either: Snaps the center of the wire to the closer of the routing grid or half-grid track.
.RE   Default: None  "\fB-spacing<spacing>\fR" Specifies the width of the gap between stripes in each set. You can specify different spacing between each pair of stripes. For n number of stripes, you can specify n 1 spacing values. If fewer values are specified, the last-specified spacing is used for the remaining unmatched stripe pairs.  "\fB-stapling {length | auto {offset layer1_pitch:n | reference_layer1 [reference_layer2]}}\fR" Turns on the stapling stripe generation feature and controls the stapling pattern. In the syntax:
.RS  "*" 2  length: Specifies the length of stapling stripes.  "*" 2  auto: When specified, stapling length is calculated by the tool automatically, with the minimum length that can be DRC clean.  "*" 2  offset: Specifies the distance from design boundary to the center of the first stapling stripe by default. Refer to the following example:  Example 1  addStripe -stapling {0.5 0.6 0.8:1} -nets {VDD VSS} -layer metal2 -width 0.1 -direction vertical -set_to_set_distance 0.5  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)    "*" 2  pitch:n: Specifies the center to center distance between two stapling stripes in end direction (refer to Example 1 above). It is defined by n times of the track pitch on layer1, where stripes are needed to be connected by stapling stripes.  "*" 2  reference_layer1: When the stripes on layer1 to be connected already exist, you can directly specify the reference layer 1 name. It specifies that the stapling stripe center is on the center line of the reference stripes (offset value is the center offset of first bottom/left stripe; the pitch:n is the set-to-set distance of stripes on layer1).  "*" 2  reference_layer2: When the stripes on layer2 to be connected already exist, you can specify the reference layer 2 name, so that the stapling stripes are generated referring to both layer1 and layer2 and connect them. When reference_layer2 is specified, the real offset and stapling pitch will be the average value from layer1 and layer2 settings. It aims to find the center of two layers of wires to be connected by stapling stripes. Refer to the example below:  Example 2  set metal3_track_offset 3  set metal3_pitch 0.8  addStripe -stapling '3 $metal3_track_offset $metal3_pitch:5 metal5' -nets {VDD VSS} -layer metal4 -width 0.5 -direction vertical -set_to_set_distance 2  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE   You can use -stapling in the following ways:
.RS  "*" 2  -stapling {length|auto offset pitch:n}  "*" 2  -stapling {length|auto reference_layer}  "*" 2  -stapling {length|auto offset pitch:n reference_layer2}  "*" 2  -stapling {length|auto reference_layer1 reference_layer2}
.RE   "\fB-start <value>\fR" The start coordinate for adding stripes.  "\fB-start_from {bottom | top | left | right}\fR" For horizontal stripes:
.RS  "*" 2 bottom indicates that stripes should be generated from bottom to top, taking the bottom offset into account.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 top indicates that stripes should be generated from top to bottom, taking the top offset into account.
.RE   Default: bottom  For vertical stripes:
.RS  "*" 2 left indicates that stripes should be generated from left to right, taking the left offset into account.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 right indicates that stripes should be generated from right to left, taking the right offset into account.
.RE   Default: left  Note: Offset values set with this parameter are considered "hard": The power planning software adheres strictly to the values. However, the opposite values are considered "soft": Such values could be greater than the hard values, but will never be less than the hard values. For example, if you set a right offset value of 4 m, the left value will be at least 4 m, but could be greater.  "\fB-start_offset <real_value>\fR" Specifies the starting offset value off of the appropriate boundary of the stripe generation area to the nearest edge of the first stripe. For example, for vertical stripes starting from the left, offset is measured from the left side of the stripe generation area to the left edge of the first stripe. This is an optional field.
.P Note: The parameters -start and -start_offset are exclusive, and cannot be used together.   "\fB-stop\fR" The stop coordinate for the region for adding the stripe.  "\fB-stop_offset <real_value>\fR" Specifies the stopping offset value off of the appropriate boundary of the stripe generation area. For example, for vertical stripes starting from the left, the offset is measured from the right side of the stripe generation area. This is an optional field.  Note: The parameters -stop and -stop_offset are exclusive, and cannot be used together.  "\fB-switch_layer_over_obs {0 | 1}\fR" Specifies if the switch layer is placed over obstructions. It controls whether a stripe switches layers, is routed over blocks, and then continues on the original layer.  Using this parameter eliminates the need for a power routing mesh layer, and avoids maximum via stack rule violations.  Default: 0  Type: Boolean, optional  "\fB-uda <subclass_string>\fR" Displays the user defined attribute attached to each created stripe segment.  "\fB-use_interleaving_wire_group {0 | 1}\fR" If set to 1, connects multiple wires from the same net together, even if separated by wires from a different net. You can only specify this parameter if you also specify -use_wire_group  1. If you do not specify this parameter or if you specify it with a value of 0, interleaving wire groups are not used.  Default: 0  "\fB-use_wire_group {-1 | 0 | 1}\fR" If set to 1, connects wires from the same net together. If you do not specify this parameter or if you specify it with a value of 0, wire groups are not used.  If set to -1 and multiple same net are specified in -nets, the wire group property will not be updated or created.  Note: For stripes to connect to rings using wire groups, you must specify the -useWireGroup parameter in both the addRing and addStripe commands.  Default: 0  "\fB-use_wire_group_bits <integer>\fR" Specifies how many nets are to be included in the wire group. You can only specify this parameter if you also specify -use_wire_group 1.  Default: The same number of nets as specified in the -nets parameter.  "\fB-via_rows <integer>\fR"  "\fB-via_columns <integer>\fR" Specifies the number of cuts to make in the power vias (for both stack and non-stack).  Default: 0  "\fB-width <width>\fR" Specifies the width of the stripes. You can specify a different width for each net within a set. If the number of widths specified does not match the number of net names, the last-specified width is used for the rest of unmatched nets. 
.SH Example
