.P Creates a new skew group within the design. CCOpt balances clock trees according to skew group requirements. Balancing between multiple trees can be achieved using the sources parameter. The sinks to be balanced can either be specified explicitly using the shared_sinks or exclusive_sinks parameters or can be automatically inferred by using the auto_sinks parameter.
.P Every skew group is assigned a rank, accessible through the exclusive_sinks_rank property:
.RS  "*" 2 Shared skew groups always have an exclusive_sinks_rank value of zero.  "*" 2 Exclusive skew groups always have an exclusive_sinks_rank value greater than zero. When an exclusive skew group is created, CCOpt assigns that exclusive skew group a rank one greater than the highest existing skew group.
.RE
.P The rank of a skew group determines whether a member pin is an active sink in that skew group or not. A pin is only an active sink in the skew group(s) with the highest rank, out of all the skew groups to which the pin belongs. An active sink is a pin that will be balanced against other active sinks in the same skew group.
.P For example, consider the following sequence of commands:
.RS  "*" 2  create_ccopt_skew_group -name SG1 -sources top -shared_sinks [get_ccopt_clock_tree_sinks */CK]  "*" 2  create_ccopt_skew_group -name SG2 -sources top -exclusive_sinks [get_ccopt_clock_tree_sinks *XYZ*/CK]  "*" 2  create_ccopt_skew_group -name SG3 -sources top -exclusive_sinks [get_ccopt_clock_tree_sinks *XYZ_01*/CK]
.RE
.P After running the first command, a single skew group SG1 is created. This is a shared skew group, so has an exclusive_sinks_rank value of zero. All the "CK" pins in the design are members of this skew group. In addition, all the "CK" pins are active sinks in skew group SG1. This is because SG1 is the highest ranked skew group so far, even though it has a rank of zero.
.P The second command defines an exclusive skew group SG2. This is given an exclusive_sinks_rank value of 1, which is one higher than the current highest rank of 0. Sinks that match the pattern *XYZ*/CK are now members of both SG1 and SG2. However, they are only active sinks in SG2, which is the highest ranked parent skew group till now. Sinks that don't match this pattern remain active pins in SG1.
.P The third command defines another exclusive skew group, SG3. This is given an exclusive_sinks_rank value of 2, which is one higher than the current highest rank of 1. Sinks that match the pattern *XYZ_01*/CK (which must also be members of SG2, since those sinks would also match the pattern *XYZ*/CK) are now members of skew groups SG1, SG2, and SG3. However, they are only active sinks in SG3, which is the highest ranked parent skew group. Sinks that matched the pattern *XYZ*/CK but not *XYZ_01*/CK are members of both SG1 and SG2 but only active sinks of SG2. Sinks that don't match the pattern *XYZ*/CK are members of SG1 and active sinks in SG1. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_ccopt_skew_group parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man create_ccopt_skew_group.  "\fB-auto_sinks\fR" When specified, determines the target sinks for the skew group based on the input pins reachable from the source.  "\fB-balance_skew_groups <skew_groups>\fR" Specifies that the new skew groups should be created by merging the specified skew groups in order to balance them together as a single skew group.  Note: The sources of skew groups are specified using the -sources parameter. However, if the -sources parameter is not specified and you are using the -balance_skew_groups parameter, then the sources are the sources of the skew groups that are specified using this parameter.  "\fB-constrains cts | ccopt_initial | ccopt | subset_of_values | all | none   \fR" Specifies whether the skew group should constrain cts, ccopt_initial,  ccopt, a subset of these values, all, or  none. If the value includes cts, the created skew group will constrain  cts, if the value includes  ccopt_initial, the created skew group will be used to constrain CCOpt's initial solution.If the value includes  ccopt, the created skew group will constrain CCOpt's final solution.   "\fB-exclusive_sinks <pins>\fR" Specifies the input pins in the design that CCOpt should consider as members of the new skew group. This will give the new skew_group an exclusive_sinks_rank 1 greater than any other currently defined skew group, effectively removing the pins from all skew_groups that they currently belong to. If both "shared_sinks" and "exclusive_sinks" are not specified, CCOpt will use the set of sinks reachable from the source if the auto_sinks switch is provided, or no sinks otherwise.  "\fB-filtered_auto_sinks <pins>\fR" Specifies that the target sinks should be determined automatically from the subset provided. The target sinks for the skew group are determined based on the input pins reachable from the source. However, of these pins, only those are selected that are also present in the list of pins provided as a filter.   "\fB-from_clocks <clock_names>\fR" Specifies the name of the clock for which this skew group was extracted.   "\fB-from_constraint_modes <constraint_mode_names>  \fR" Specifies the constraint mode for which this skew group was extracted.   "\fB-from_delay_corners <delay_corner_names>   \fR" Specifies the delay corners associated with the constraint modes for which this skew group was extracted.   "\fB-name <skew_group_name>\fR" Specifies the user-defined name for the new skew group. The name must be unique.   "\fB-rank <rank>\fR" Specifies the exclusive_sinks_rank for this skew group.   "\fB-shared_sinks <pins>\fR" Specifies the input pins in the design that CCOpt should consider as members of the new skew group but are also shared with other skew groups. These pins are members of both the original skew group and the new skew group. This implies a exclusive_sinks_rank of 0.   "\fB-sinks <pins>\fR" Specifies the input pins in the design that CCOpt should consider as members of the new skew group.   "\fB-sources <pins>  \fR" Specifies the source pins of the skew group.   "\fB-target_insertion_delay <value>\fR" Specifies the target insertion delay to be used for the skew group. CCOpt attempts to keep the latency of all sinks within half the target skew on either side of this delay. For example,  create_ccopt_skew_group -name b1 -sources b1 -exclusive_sinks {A/CK B/CK G/CK} -target_insertion_delay 0.3ns -target_skew 0.1ns  "\fB-target_skew <value>\fR" Specifies the skew that the clock tree synthesis should aim for. It sets the target_skew property for the created skew group (set_ccopt_property target_skew <value>).  If this parameter is not set, the software will use the default value that it gets from get_ccopt_property target_skew.  For example:  get_ccopt_property target_skew  The software returns the following value:  2
