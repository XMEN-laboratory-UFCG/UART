.TH dbSet  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBdbSet\fR \-  Changes the specified attribute value for a database object
.SH Syntax \fBdbSet\fR  [-d]  {<objList> | head | top | selected}  [.<objType>]*.<attrName> <attrValue>  [-help] 
.P Changes the specified attribute value for a database object. The dbSet command takes an object or object list as a starting point, then uses a period to traverse to other related objects, or access attributes. Additional periods can be used to continue traversing the database schema.
.P The dbGet command also helps in finding out the settable objects. For example, after selecting an instance and querying its pt* attributes with dbGet selected.?h pt*, the software gives displays:
.RS  "*" 2 pt(settable): pt, location of the instance  "*" 2 pt_x(settable): x coordinate of location of the instance  "*" 2 pt_y(settable): y coordinate of location of the instance.
.RE
.P The pt, pt_x, and pt_y attributes of an instance can also be changed using dbSet. In the following example, the name attribute of the selected instance cannot be changed with dbSet:
.P  dbget selected.?h name
.P Following is the output of the above command:
.P name: string, Fully qualified (path) name of the instance
.P The dbSet command does not create or delete objects. You may also change the mask of the multi-color pillar via through the dbSet command, as shown below:
.P dbSet $via.cutMasks $mask
.P Use the dbGet command with the
.?h operator, or see Innovus Database Object Information, to find out which object attributes can be set. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-d\fR" Specifies values in database units, specified in integers.  Default: Specifies values in user units, in microns.  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each dbSet parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command: man dbSet.  "\fB<objList>\fR" Specifies one or more object pointers. The list must be homogeneous.  "\fBhead\fR" Specifies the pointer for the root, or head of the design as the starting point (also known as dbgHead).  "\fBtop\fR" Specifies the pointer to the top cell in the design as the starting point (also known as dbgTopCell).  "\fBselected\fR" Specifies that the selected object (or objects) is the starting point.  "\fB<.objType>\fR" Specifies the object type.  "\fB<.attrName>\fR" Specifies the object attribute to change.  "\fB<attrValue>\fR" Specifies the new attribute value. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command changes the placement status of the top cell instances to fixed:  dbSet top.insts.pStatus fixed  "*" 2 The following command sets all the pad instances to the placement status fixed:  dbSet [dbGet top.insts.cell.baseClass pad -p2].pstatus fixed
