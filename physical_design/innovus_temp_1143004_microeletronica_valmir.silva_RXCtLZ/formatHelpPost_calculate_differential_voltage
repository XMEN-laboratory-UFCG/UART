.SH Name \fBcalculate_differential_voltage\fR \-  Determines the differential voltage between a receiver/driver pair during ramp-up analysis
.SH Syntax  \fBcalculate_differential_voltage\fR  [-help]  -diffv_limit <value>  -power_directory <directory_name>  -state_directory <directory_name> 
.P Determines the differential voltage between a receiver/driver pair during ramp-up analysis. This command can be used to mitigate the risk of high short-circuit current for a driver-receiver instance pair due to slow/fast (differential) ramp-up voltage at the output of the power-switch cell connected to the driver/receiver cell.
.P The calculate_differential_voltage command reports the differential potential for those receiver/driver pairs that are greater than the the specified differential voltage threshold, and the time interval at which the differential voltage remains greater than the threshold. You must specify the set_power_analysis_mode -create_driver_db true parameter before specifying this command.
.P The following is the format of the output report:
.P # <<driverName>>   <<receiverName>>   <<peak_diffv>>  <<minT>>   <<maxT>> 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.   "\fB-diffv_limit <value>\fR" Specifies to report differential voltage for the receiver/driver pairs that exceed the specified threshold limit.  "\fB-power_directory <directory_name>  \fR" Specifies the path to the power directory to access the driver-receiver pairs.   "\fB-state_directory <directory_name>\fR" Specifies the path to the state directory generated by rail analysis to access the EIV or timing database. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command lists all the driver-receiver pairs that exceed the differential voltage limit of 0.001:  calculate_differential_voltage -diffv_limit 0.001 -state_directory dynamic_rail/core_105C_dynamic_1 -power_directory dynamic_power  The following is a snippet of the generated report:  # <driverName>         <receiverName>       <peak_diffv>     <minT>     <maxT>  column/MSV_I2        column/MULT8_reg_1_4    0.7382          5e-11    2.75e-09  column/HIER_INST     column/MULT8_reg_1_4    0.7382          5e-11    2.75e-09
