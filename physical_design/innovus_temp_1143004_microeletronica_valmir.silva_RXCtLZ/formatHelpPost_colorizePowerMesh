.SH Name \fBcolorizePowerMesh\fR \-  Use this command to colorize (assign mask information) power structures, including power wires and power via metals, in multi-pattern layers. This command also fixes color violations of power metals including via metals
.SH Syntax \fBcolorizePowerMesh\fR  [-help] [-reverse_with_nondefault_width {0 | 1}] 
.P Use this command to colorize (assign mask information) power structures, including power wires and power via metals, in multi-pattern layers. This command also fixes color violations of power metals including via metals. It is recommended to use this command once all the power meshes are built. This command honors the FIXEDMASKS keyword in the LEF of the cell, in the case of colored LEF.
.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This command colors only the PG wires and PG via enclosure. but not the PG via cut. Also, it does not color pre-routed signal nets. All signal nets are colored while using the place_opt_design or routeDesign command.  "*" 2 The command does not fix via cut colors. To fix cut color or trim cut with violation, use the fixVia command. This command requires correct node setting in setDesignMode -process/setNanoRouteMode -route_process_node.  "*" 2 The wide NDR wires will be assigned with a different color than the track color through this command.

.SH Parameter   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each colorizePowerMesh parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man colorizePowerMesh  "\fB-reverse_with_nondefault_width {0 | 1}\fR" Reverses the 'on track' wire color to the different 'from track' color, when the wire width is not the default width.
