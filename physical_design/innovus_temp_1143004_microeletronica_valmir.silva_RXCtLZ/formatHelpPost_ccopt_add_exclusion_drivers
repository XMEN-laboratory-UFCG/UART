.TH ccopt_add_exclusion_drivers  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBccopt_add_exclusion_drivers\fR \-  Removes the excluded sinks from the clock trees by adding exclusion drivers above these sinks
.SH Syntax \fBccopt_add_exclusion_drivers\fR  [-help]  [-lib_cell list_library_cells]
.P Removes the excluded sinks from the clock trees by adding exclusion drivers above these sinks. Use this command after running the create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec command. Alternatively, you can use the add_exclusion_drivers property to remove the exclude sinks from the clock tree. It is recommended that you use one of the two, either the command or the property, to exclude sinks from the clock trees. 
.P For details of this property, see the "Related Properties" section below.
.P The names of the newly added drivers start with 'CTS_cse', so that they can be easily identified. This functionality is useful because it allows you to fix hold violations on clock nets. GigaOpt does not fix hold violations on clock nets. For example, if a pin, D, of a flop is a clock sink then the net attached to the D pin is a clock net. Any hold violations will not be fixed by GigaOpt. However, by adding an exclusion buffer above the D pin, the net between the buffer's output pin and the D pin of the flop becomes a non-clock net and any hold violations will be fixed by GigaOpt. Therefore, this new functionality allows previously unfixable hold violations to be fixed. 
.P You can use the following command to view the exclusion drivers that have been added by CCOpt:
.P get_ccopt_clock_tree_sinks *CTS_cse* 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help       \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ccopt_add_exclusion_drivers parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man ccopt_add_exclusion_drivers.   "\fB-lib_cell    \fR" Specifies a particular buffer or inverter to use as an exclusion driver. If this parameter is not specified or if the property, add_exclusion_drivers, is used to enable this functionality, then CCOpt will choose small area drivers from the CTS cell lists to use as exclusion drivers. CCOpt will either add pairs of inverters, or single buffers as exclusion drivers. While choosing the cell to use, CCOpt will choose either inverters or buffers depending on the value specified using the use_inverters property. This property specifies whether clock tree synthesis should use inverters or buffers when balancing the clock trees.  For more information about the use_inverters property, use the following command:  get_ccopt_property -help use_inverters 
.SH Related Properties
.RS  "*" 2 add_exclusion_drivers  This is a user-settable property. Setting this property to true before running ccopt_designor ccopt_design -cts will cause CCOpt to add extra drivers above exclude pins to remove them from the clock tree.  Normally an exclusion buffer or a pair of inverters are added above an exclude sink to remove them from the clock tree. A new clock sink will be created on the input to the newly added driver. If there is a suitable pre-existing driver above the exclude pin, then no extra driver will be added - the new clock sink will be created on the input to the pre-existing driver.  
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 effective_sink_type  This is a read-only property. It indicates how CCOpt will treat a given pin, taking into account any implicit_sink_type and sink_type settings.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 implicit_sink_type  This is a read-only property. It Indicates the type of sink that CCOpt classified this pin as. The possible values are exclude, ignore, stop, and empty string "". Instances of cell pins that are data pins, scan input pins, or scan enable pins will have implicit_sink_type=exclude. This means that unless there is an explicit sink_type set for that pin, either ignore or stop, they will be removed from the clock tree. This property takes into account the settings done using the sink_tpe property. Setting a non-default value for the sink_type property will override the implicit_sink_type property.  "*" 2 sink_type  This is a user-settable property. It specifies the type of sink that the pin represents. Valid values are auto, through, stop, ignore, min, and exclude. To exclude a clock sink that is not already implicit_exclude, you can set this property to exclude. This will change the effective_sink_type property to exclude, and the sink will be removed from the clock tree.    For more information about the above properties, use the following command:  get_ccopt_property -help <property_name>
