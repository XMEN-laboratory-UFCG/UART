.SH Name \fBcreate_library_set\fR \-  Associates a TCL list of timing and cdB/UDN libraries with a specified library set name
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_library_set\fR  [-help]  [-aocv <string>]  [-library_side_file <string>]  -name <libSetName>  [-si <string>]  [-socv <string>]  [-timing <string>]
.P Associates a TCL list of timing and cdB/UDN libraries with a specified library set name. Library sets allow a group of library files to be treated as a single entity so that higher-level descriptions (delay calculation corners) can simply refer to the library configuration by name. The same library set can be referenced multiple times by different delay calculation corners.
.P Timing libraries can be in text format or Cadence binary library format (LDB). The LDB (library database) files generated from other tools, like Voltus, or Genus are read in to the software with an error message ( TECHLIB-1249). The LDB files are not forward compatible, that is, a LDB generated from 15.2 version cannot be used with 15.1 or prior versions of the software.
.P Note: The create_library_set command determines the priority of ECSM vs CCS data (if both are present). The software first checks for ECSM construct, if it is missing then CCS construct is loaded.    Note: The order in which you define timing libraries is important. The software considers the first library you specify in the list as the master library, with each successive library having a lower priority.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-aocv <string>\fR" Specifies the AOCV libraries to include in the library set.  "\fB-library_side_file <string>\fR" Specifies the library side file.   "\fB-name <libSetName>\fR" Specifies the name for the library set being created. This name is used to associate the library list with a specific delay calculation corner.  "\fB-si <string>\fR" Specifies cdB libraries and/or user-defined noise (UDN) models to include in the library set. The cdB and/or UDN libraries are required for performing signal integrity analysis.  Note: You cannot use this parameter for CCS-N or ECSM-N models, that is, for cdBs only.  "\fB-socv <string>\fR" Specifies the SOCV libraries to include in the library set.  "\fB-timing <string>\fR" Specifies the timing libraries to include in the library set.  Note: Libraries intended for use in an ECSM-based multi-library interpolation must be grouped within an additional level of Tcl list structure to identify the intended usage to the library subsystem. Specify three timing libraries that are characterized at different voltages (typically the lower and upper voltage bounds, and a third intermediate point). All voltages required by the software will be interpolated from this set of libraries. The libraries in the set can differ only in the characterization voltage; they must be identical to each other in all other aspects. However, if you want to perform multi-temperature based library interpolation, you can use two library files that are characterized at different temperatures for each voltage value. See the examples for creating an ECSM-based multi-library set and multi-temperature based library interpolation in the Examples section.  Note: The ECSM and CCS libraries can be very large and loading them may take significant time. You can convert the ASCII NLDM (Liberty
.lib), ECSM, and CCS libraries to a binary version using the write_ldb command. For conversion of libraries to a binary version, refer to write_ldb.Instead of the original ASCII libraries, you can specify these binary libraries in the configuration file:
.RS  "*" 2 Original MMMC setup file: create_library_set -name libName -timing "AAA.lib BBB.ecsm CCC.ccs"  "*" 2 New MMMC setup file: create_library_set -name libName -timing "AAA.ldb BBB.ldb CCC.ldb"
.RE
.P The library sets can be created only after the top module is set. The following figure shows the creation of a library set that associates timing libraries and cdB libraries with a nominal voltage of 1 volt with the library name isCOM-1V.
.P  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P Note: Either AOCV or SOCV libraries can be specified at a time. The AOCV and SOCV files can also be added to the library set by either -aocv [list aocv1.lib aocv2.lib] or -socv [list socv1.lib socv2.lib] in the create_library_set settings. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a library set that associates timing libraries and cdB libraries with a nominal voltage of 1 volt with the library name IsCOM-1V:   create_library_set    -name IsCOM-1V -timing [list stdcell_F_1V.lib ram_F.lib pad.lib]  -si [list stdcell_F_2.cdb ram_F.cdb pad.cdb]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a library set that can be used to specify the 2-volt version of a core cell library, which could be associated later with a 2-volt MSMV power domain specified in the design:   create_library_set   -name IsCOM-2V   -timing [list stdcell_F_2V.lib]
