.SH Name \fBccopt_design\fR \-  Performs clock concurrent optimization (CCOpt) on the current loaded design in Innovus
.SH Syntax \fBccopt_design\fR   [-help]   [-check_prerequisites]   [-ckSpec]   [-cts]   [-expandedViews]  [-num_paths <number_of_paths>]  [-outDir <dirname>]    [-prefix <fileNamePrefix>]  [-timing_debug_report]
.P Performs clock concurrent optimization (CCOpt) on the current loaded design in Innovus. CCOpt optimizes both the clock tree and the datapath to meet global timing constraints. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help  \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ccopt_design parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man ccopt_design.   "\fB-check_prerequisites\fR" Checks that all the prerequisites for running clock tree synthesis are fulfilled without actually doing CTS. For example, it checks that the design is loaded, and the options set by that the user are correct.  "\fB-ckSpec\fR" Runs the design using the legacy FE-CTS specification file. This mode is a compatibility layer to enable the use of CCOpt technology with existing FE-CTS specification flows. It enables a translation step that transforms constructs in the FE-CTS specification file into a CCOpt clock tree specification tcl script.    Note: This parameter is used with the -cts parameter to specify that CTS part of CCOpt will be performed using the legacy FE-CTS specification file.  "\fB-cts\fR" Turns off clock concurrent optimization, and performs only clock tree synthesis (CTS) using the CCOpt engine. It does not perform any datapath optimization or useful skew.  This parameter can be used with or without the -ckSpec parameter. When used with the -ckSpec parameter, it specifies that the CTS part of CCOpt will be performed using the legacy FE-CTS specification file.  "\fB-expandedViews\fR" This parameter is not interpreted in CCOpt but passed directly to optDesign. The parameter is same as optDesign-expandedViews parameter, which is specified to generate detailed view-specific timing reports at the end of the optDesign command run.  "\fB-num_paths <number_of_paths>\fR" Specifies the number of paths generated in the timing reports. By default, all timing paths are reported.   "\fB-outDir <dirname>\fR" This parameter specifies the directory where the software writes timing reports that are generated after timing optimization.   The default directory is
./timingReports  "\fB-prefix <fileNamePrefix>\fR" Specifies a prefix for optDesign report file names.   Default: DesignName_DesignStage , where DesignStage is preCTS, postCTS, or postRoute  "\fB-timing_debug_report\fR" When specified, generates a machine-readable timing debug report after completing CTS. This report is used for debugging timing results using the timing debug feature in Innovus. The number of paths to be reported can be specified using the -num_paths parameter.
