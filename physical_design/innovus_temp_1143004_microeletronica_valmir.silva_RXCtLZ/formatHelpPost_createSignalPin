.SH Name \fBcreateSignalPin\fR \-  Promotes signal pins in the IO pad/block to the top-level design as a physical pin for specified instances or pins
.SH Syntax \fBcreateSignalPin\fR  [-help]  [-ignore_floating_pins]  {-inst <inst_name_list> | -pins <pin_name_list>}
.P Promotes signal pins in the IO pad/block to the top-level design as a physical pin for specified instances or pins. The instance's cell type should be either CLASS PAD AREAIO or CLASS BLOCK. The pins to be promoted should have geometry on the top layer. You can choose to ignore floating pins. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each createSignalPin parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man createSignalPin  "\fB-ignore_floating_pins\fR" Ignores the floating pins. If this parameter is not specified when promoting pins to the top level, the tool converts the floating pins in the instance to pgTerms because these pins are not logically connected to any terminal on the top level.   "\fB-inst <inst_name_list>\fR" Specifies the names of instances for which pins need to be created.  Note: This option cannot be used with -pins.  "\fB-pins <pin_name_list>\fR" Lists specific pins that are to be promoted to the top level. The specified pins should be hierarchical.  Note: This option cannot be used with -inst. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The instance lna_inst has a signal pin called data1_i. The pin data1_i has a port geometry shape on the top layer. The lef for the lna cell is as follows:  MACRO lna  CLASS BLOCK ; 
......    PIN data1_i      DIRECTION INPUT ;      USE SIGNAL ;      PORT          CLASS BUMP ;          LAYER METAL8 ;          RECT   10.00 10.00   20.00 100.00 ;      END    END data1_i 
....  END lna  The following command creates a signal pin for the instance lna_inst:  createSignalPin -inst lna_inst
.RS  "*" 2  Before this command is run, the pin is local to lna_inst:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 After the command is run, the pin is promoted:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE  "*" 2 The following command promotes the specified pins to the top level:  createSignalPin -pins {lna_inst/data1_i lna_inst/data2_i phy/QS_PADP}
