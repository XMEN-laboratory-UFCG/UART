.SH Name \fBcheckFiller\fR \-  Checks for locations that are missing filler cells, after adding the cells with the addFiller command
.SH Syntax \fBcheckFiller\fR  [-help]   [-area <llx lly urx ury>]  [-file <fileName>]  [-horizontal_max_length]  [-powerDomain <power_domain_name>]  [-vertical_stack_max_length]   [-reportGap <microns>| -adjacentFiller1]  
.P Checks for locations that are missing filler cells, after adding the cells with the addFiller command. Optionally, generates a report with details on sites that are missing filler cells.
.P If you run this command without any parameters, it reports the total number of sites in the core area that are missing filler cells. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-adjacentFiller1\fR" Checks for locations that are filled with adjacent one-site-width fillers. With this parameter, checkFiller flags any one-site-width filler placed next to each other as a violation.  To enable this parameter, you must first specify a one-site-width filler by using the following command:  setFillerMode -core <fillerCellList>  "\fB-area {<llx lly urx ury>}\fR" Specifies a bounding box for the area in which to check for missing filler cells.  Default: Entire core area  "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Writes the output of the checkFiller command to the specified file.   "\fB-horizontal_max_length\fR" Checks if the horizontal stack length violates max limit.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each checkFiller parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man  checkFiller.  "\fB-powerDomain <power_domain_name>\fR" Checks for missing filler cells in the specified power domain.  The software checks for missing filler cells in all power domains if you do not specify this parameter.  "\fB-reportGap <microns>\fR" Checks only for gaps of the specified size--ignores any other gap, whether larger or smaller.   "\fB-vertical_stack_max_length\fR" Checks if the vertical stack length violates the max limit. 
.SH Examples
.P The following command checks the entire core area after running addFiller and reports the number of sites that are missing filler cells:
.P checkFiller
.P The software reports the following:
.P *INFO: Total number of gaps found: 85
.P The following command checks within the specified bounding box at coordinates {0 0 100 100} and reports the number of sites that have a gap of exactly 0.14 microns:
.P checkFiller -reportGap 0.14 -area {0 0 100 100}
.P The software reports the following:
.P *INFO: Total number of 0.140 microns width gap found: 3
