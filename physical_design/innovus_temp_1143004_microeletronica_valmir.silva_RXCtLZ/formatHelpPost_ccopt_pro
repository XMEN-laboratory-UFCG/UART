.SH Name \fBccopt_pro\fR \-  Repairs clock tree design rule violations (DRVs) and skews that have occurred in the clock tree across a routing step
.SH Syntax      \fBccopt_pro\fR  [-help]  [-enable_average_id_reduction {true | false}]  [-enable_downsizing_pass {true | false}]  [-enable_drv_fixing {true | false}]  [-enable_drv_fixing_by_rebuffering {true | false}]  [-enable_refine_place {true | false}]  [-enable_routing_eco {true | false}]  [-enable_skew_fixing {true | false}]  [-enable_skew_fixing_by_rebuffering {true | false}] 
.P Repairs clock tree design rule violations (DRVs) and skews that have occurred in the clock tree across a routing step. DRVs and skews can be fixed either by sizing existing clock instances or by adding buffers. Use this command to enable or disable average insertion delay reduction, global cell downsizing pass, refine placement of design, ECO routing, legalizer sharing, and the timing update step. 
.P This command can be run at the following stages:
.RS  "*" 2 After  ccopt_design- when only the clock is routed  "*" 2 After  routeDesign, but before optDesign-postRoute - when both clock and datapath are routed.
.RE
.P By default a post ccopt_design call to this command will fix DRVs and skew violations by resizing instances. It will also fix persistent DRVs by adding buffers. However, when called post routeDesign, this command is less disruptive by default and will only
.P perform resizing to fix DRVs.  The ccopt_pro log will report a list of "active optimizations" for clarification of what steps will be executed.
.P By default, the command will modify the clock to reduce violations and then call refinePlace and ecoRoute to patch up the modified routes. Both refinePlace and ecoRoute parts may be disabled to reduce runtime for user experimentation.  But they will need to be called eventually, either with a final call to ccopt_pro or manually. Without them, timing measurements will be inaccurate.
.P Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 This command is integrated within the ccopt_design command and is run after clock routing.  It can be identified in the ccopt_design log with a search for "PostConditioning....".  "*" 2 This command is integrated within the optDesign -postRoute command.  It can be identified in the optDesign log with a search for "PRO...".  "*" 2 If this command is called after running ccopt_design (when only the clock is routed), it will also call earlyGlobalRoute on the datapath nets.  "*" 2 The ccopt_pro command and the clock DRV fixing performed by running optDesign -postRoute do not work when signoff effort-level for extraction is specified using setExtractRCMode -effortLevel signoff. The signoff effort-level for extraction should be used only for ECO flows, after postRoute optimization.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help  \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ccopt_pro parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man ccopt_pro.   "\fB-enable_average_id_reduction  {true | false}   \fR" Enables or disables average insertion delay reduction.  "\fB-enable_downsizing_pass  {true | false}  \fR" Enables or disables a global cell downsizing pass.  "\fB-enable_drv_fixing {true | false}  \fR" Enables or disables DRV fixing.   "\fB-enable_drv_fixing_by_rebuffering {true | false}  \fR" Enables or disables DRV fixing by adding buffers.   "\fB-enable_refine_place {true | false}  \fR" Enables or disables refine placement of design. Disabling this may result in instance overlaps.   "\fB-enable_routing_eco {true | false}  \fR" Enables or disables the ECO routing step, which corrects routing for new instance locations. Disabling this will leave inaccurate routing in place and lead to timing inaccuracy.   "\fB-enable_skew_fixing {true | false}  \fR" Enables or disables fixing of clock tree skew.  Note the following:
.RS  "*" 2 When -enable_skew_fixing is set to false then whether the -enable_skew_fixing_by_rebuffering parameter is specified as true or false,  there is no skew fixing during ccopt_pro.  "*" 2 When -enable_skew_fixing is set to true, while -enable_skew_fixing_by_rebuffering parameter is set to false, the software resizes cells to fix skew.  "*" 2 When -enable_skew_fixing is set to true, while -enable_skew_fixing_by_rebuffering parameter is set to true, the software not only resizes cells but also does rebuffering to fix skew.
.RE   "\fB-enable_skew_fixing_by_rebuffering {true | false}    \fR" Enables or disables fixing of clock tree skew by adding buffers. This will only help with lengthening short paths.
