.SH Name \fBcreatePipelineNetGroup\fR \-  Creates Net Groups for Pipeline Flip-Flop (PFF) Placement and Reporting
.SH Syntax \fBcreatePipelineNetGroup\fR  [-help]  netGroupName  [-endReserve <reserveDistanceInMicrons>]                         [-endTerm <termList>]  [-inst <instNameListOrRegularExp>]  [-net <listOfNetnamesOrRegularExp>]  [-startReserve <reserveDistanceInMicrons>]  [-startTerm <termList>]
.P Creates Net Groups for Pipeline Flip-Flop (PFF) Placement and Reporting. This command can be used for analysis before the flops exist in the netlist; or it can be used post flop insertion to add a new net group. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-endReserve <reserveDistanceInMicrons>\fR" Specifies a distance value from the end points on block boundary to the internal connection inside the block, which is accounted for in each stage distance value. The unit is in micron.  "\fB-endTerm <termList>\fR" Specifies the end points of net groups.  "\fB<netGroupName>\fR" Specifies the name of the net group.   "\fB-inst <instNameListOrRegularExp>\fR" Creates net group of all nets connected to the given instances. All the instances must be flip-flops or latches. All the nets attached to the D and Q pins are put into the PFF net group.  "\fB-net <listOfNetNamesOrRegularEx><p>\fR" Creates net group of all given nets.  "\fB-startReserve <reserveDistanceInMicrons>\fR" Specifies a distance budget from internal connections inside block to the start point of the PFF net. This value is added to the first stage distance when calculating equidistant spacing for each stage. The unit is in micron.  "\fB-startTerm <termList>\fR" Creates net group of all data nets between the given end points. The PFF-chain is traced from the startTerm, through D and Q terminals of PFF(s) until an endTerm is matched. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a net group named `netGroup1' for Pipeline Flip-Flop (PFF) of all data nets between blockA/DATA_OUT* and blockB/DATA_IN*:   createPipelineNetGroup netGroup1 -startTerm blockA/DATA_OUT* -endTerm blockB/DATA_IN*
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a net group named netGroup2 for all nets connected with all instance names that begin with PIPELINE_INST/in:   createPipelineNetGroup NetGroup2 -inst PIPELINE_INST/in*
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a net group named netGroup3 for all net names that begin with SUM_P4.   createPipelineNetGroup NetGroup3 -net SUM_P4*
