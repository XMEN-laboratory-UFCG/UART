.SH Name \fBconnectMacroFeedthrough\fR \-  Connects predefined feedthrough pins in custom macros to overlapping nets that have wires crossing over the custom macros, based on the routing information. The feedthrough connectivity details are defined in a mapping file, which is specified through the -portmap <filename> parameter

.P Connects predefined feedthrough pins in custom macros to overlapping nets that have wires crossing over the custom macros, based on the routing information. The feedthrough connectivity details are defined in a mapping file, which is specified through the -portmap <filename> parameter. You can include or exclude specific nets or instances. This command deletes routing only for the modified nets. You can run this command after placing the design and running Early Global Route. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-abutment <float>\fR" Specifies the distance that pins on the same track and layer must have from one another so as to be considered as abutted. If two or more pins are considered as abutted, any feedthrough path that passes through one of the pins will pass through the other pin(s) as well.  Default: If this parameter is not specified, the default value is 1 micron.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-abutmentFile <string>\fR" Reports, in the file specified, the list of pins that are considered as abutted. In the file, each feedthrough path is traced from the first input pin to the last input pin. Each path is preceded by the word Begin on a new line and followed by the word End on a new line.  Here is the extract from an example file:  Begin  Inst [Inst1], Term In [A1] Term Out [X1]  Inst [Inst2], Term In [A2] Term Out [X2]  End  In the previous example, the out term X1 of instance Inst1 is abutted with the in term A2 of instance Inst2.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-checkOnly\fR" Specifies that only a report of the messages should be displayed but no changes should be made to the netlist.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-ecoFile <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the ECO file that will contain a report of the changes. You can use this file while performing ECO changes.  Here is a sample report generated through this parameter:  FORMATVERSION 2   ATTACHTERM eco_instance1 inputbuf2[2] testnet  ADDNET FE_FTM_1_testnet  ATTACHTERM eco_instance1 outputbuf2[2] FE_FTM_1_testnet ATTACHTERM i1 A FE_FTM_1_testnet ATTACHTERM eco_instance1 rstb FE_FTM_1_testnet  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-excludeInst <string>\fR" Prevents feedthrough buffers from being added for the specified instance. The names of the instances are specified in a file, specified by <fileName>. In the file, you can specify wildcards (*) for the instance names to exclude.  Default: All instances of the cell types specified in the portmap file are considered.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-excludeNet <string>\fR" Prevents feedthrough buffers from being added to the specified net. The names of the nets are specified in a file, specified by <fileName>. In the file, you can specify wildcards (*) for the net names to exclude.  Default: All nets or bus names are considered.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-floatingPortList <string>\fR" Specifies that the list of unused ports should be saved in the specified file. The file lists the instance name and the pin name for each unused port.  After running the connectMacroFeedthrough command, the unused ports should be manually tied. You can use this parameter to save the list of the unused ports to a file.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each connectMacroFeedthrough parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man connectMacroFeedthrough  "\fB-maxSearchDistance <float>\fR" Specifies the distance in microns from the wire crossing till which the command should search to find a connected feedthrough.  Note: Specifying a large value for this parameter might have an adverse impact on the Quality of Results (QoR).  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-portMap <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the file that contains the feedthrough connectivity definitions.  Default: If you do not specify a file name, a file with the name portmap in the current directory is used.by default.  Note: A file with the feethrough connectivity definitions must be available.  The syntax of the file is as follows:  MACRO <MacroName>Macro definition section  END MACRO  The definition of the macro is provided in the <Macro><definition> section, which can contain one or more feedthrough sections. The name of the feedthrough section is optional.  The syntax of the Feedthrough section is as follows:  Feedthrough [FeedthroughName]  Pin Section  END FEEDTHROUGH  Each Feedthrough section contains one section for the INPUT PIN and one section for the output pin.  Note: Multi-fanout feedthrough sections are not supported.  The syntax of the pin section is as follows:  PIN PinName  DIRECTION {in | out };  SIDE {left | right | top | bottom};  END PIN  If the pin direction is not specified, it is read from the LEF file. If you specify a value for pin direction, ensure that it is consistent with the description in the LEF file.  Note: The pin direction inout is not supported.  Note: All the predefined macro feedthrough pins should be floating pins.  Here is an example of a mapping file:  MACRO RAMXXX  FEEDTHROUGH feedthrough1  PIN feedthrough1_in  END PIN  PIN feedthrough1_out  END PIN  END FEEDTHROUGH  FEEDTHROUGH feedthrough2  PIN feedthrough2_in  END PIN  PIN feedthrough2_out  END PIN  END FEEDTHROUGH  END MACRO  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-searchAllSides\fR" Specifies that if the closest available feedthrough pin on the same side cannot be connected, the command should search for the feedthrough pins on other sides as well.  When you specify this parameter, it is recommended to limit the distance of the search using the -maxSearchDistance option to get good QoR.  Default: The command searches for a feedthrough whose in and out pins lie on the same sides of the macro on which the wires enter and exit the macro.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-selectInst <string>  \fR" Specifies that the feedthrough buffers should be added only for the specified instances.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-selectMarkedNet\fR" Specifies that feedthrough buffers should be added only to the nets that are currently selected.  Default: All nets.are considered.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-selectNet <string>\fR" Specifies that the feedthrough buffers should be added only to the specified nets.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-verbose\fR" Provides additional messages, for example net-specific messages.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command connects predefined feedthrough buffers in custom macros for nets that are listed in the file named NetsToIncludeFile. The command searches for a distance of 10 microns. The feedthrough connectivity is described in a file named portmapFileForNets.
.P connectMacroFeedthrough portMap portmapFileForNets -selectNet NetsToIncludeFile   -maxSearchDistance 10
