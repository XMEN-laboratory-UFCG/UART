.TH checkSdpGroup  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcheckSdpGroup\fR \-  Checks current SDP placement against the SDP constraints, such as order, alignment, and orientation, which may have been originally specified via an SDP relative placement file or a set of TCL commands and reports violations
.SH Syntax \fBcheckSdpGroup\fR  [-help]   [-file <fileName>]  [-sdpGroups {<sdp_name>...}] 
.P Checks current SDP placement against the SDP constraints, such as order, alignment, and orientation, which may have been originally specified via an SDP relative placement file or a set of TCL commands and reports violations. The checkSdpGroup command also creates markers in the GUI for any SDP violation it detects. The violation markers can be viewed in the Violation Browser.
.P Whenever you perform any manual editing and/or optimization step, you can use checkSdpGroup to check for any resulting SDP violations. This ensures that current placement is still valid as per the SDP constraints you had originally specified.
.P Before checking SDP placement, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Imported the design
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Created and placed SDP groups

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each checkSdpGroup parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man checkSdpGroup.  "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Generates a detailed report for the following checking categories:
.RS  "*" 2 SDP group/instance orientation
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 SDP group/instance justifyBy constraint
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Alignment by pin name constraint
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 SDP group/instance flip constraint
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Skip space constraint
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 SDP group/instance overlapping  "*" 2 Inside parent box violation
.RE   For each of the above checking category, the report includes the following information:
.RS  "*" 2 Total number of violations
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 List of SDP group/instance names that have that violation
.RE   Default: <designName>.checkSdp.rpt  "\fB-sdpGroups {<sdp_name>...}\fR" Checks only the specified sdps.  Data_type: string, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following example checks SDP placement and generates the default report:  checkSdpGroup  Sample output:  ############################################################  # Generated By: Cadence Innovus 18.10-d183_1  # Generated on: Fri Dec 15 08:53:35 2017  # HostName: noi-leenap  # Design: DTMF_CHIP  # Command: checkSdpGroup  ############################################################  ############################################################  Orientation and flip checking are only done for the object  which constaint 'orient/flip' is specified in the sdp file.  Due to the instance placement needs to match the row orientation,  the instance actual orientation might not be same as the value  that specified in the file. The orientation/flip checking will   report this kind of mismatch  ############################################################  ERROR: check justifyBy fail, sdp group DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/MPY_32_INST/M16X16_INST/i_361  ERROR: check justifyBy fail, sdp group DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/MPY_32_INST/M16X16_INST/i_375  ERROR: check skipSpace fail, sdp group DPNULL  Orientation violation: 0  JustifyBy violation: 2  AlignByPinName violation: 0  SkipSpace violation: 1  Overlap violation: 0  InsideParentBox violation: 0  ------------------------------------------------  Total violation: 3  "*" 2 The following example checks SDP placement and generates a detailed report named checkSdp1.rpt.   checkSdpGroup -file checkSdp1.rpt
