.SH Name \fBcreateRouteBlkAlongTrack\fR \-  Creates routing blockages that are aligned to specified tracks which are in the shrunken row area. Use this command during partition floorplanning
.SH Syntax \fBcreateRouteBlkAlongTrack\fR  [-help]   -align_track <string>  [-consider_cells_as_macros <string>]   [-consider_macros_as_cells <string>]  [-edge_shrink {<x y>}]   -layer <string>  [-no_cut_row]
.P Creates routing blockages that are aligned to specified tracks which are in the shrunken row area. Use this command during partition floorplanning.

.P Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 Routing blockages are also created with align to the track which is near to the shrunken row area with less than half of layer width.  "*" 2 Routing blockages honor rectilinear row area.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-align_track <string>\fR" Specifies the track layer to which the route blockages align to.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createRouteBlkAlongTrack parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man createRouteBlkAlongTrack  "\fB-consider_cells_as_macros <string>\fR" Specifies the names of the cells that are considered as macros. Blockages are not created over them.    Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-consider_macros_as_cells <string>\fR" Specifies the names of the cells that are considered as std cells. Blockages are created over them.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-edge_shrink {<x y>}\fR" Shrinks row area from the edge in X and Y direction.  Data_type: point, optional  "\fB-layer <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the layer on which the tool creates routing blockages for steam out.   Data_type: string, required  "\fB-no_cut_row\fR" Specifies whether the  blockages to be added should be based on the no-cut row site area even if the row site area is not cut in the design.
.RS  "*" 2 Without the -no_cut_row parameter, the tool will create route blockages based on the current row area. So the rows for objects like insts, place blockages are expected to be cut out before running the createRouteBlkAlongTrack command to get expected results.  "*" 2 With the -no_cut_row parameter, the tool will identify the rows have not been cut before and will call the cutRow command to get a cut row shape during the action. The route blockage is created based on the cut row shape. The actual row shape will not be changed.  "*" 2 The setFPlanMode -no_cut_row true command has the same use with this option.
.RE   Example:  In the following illustration, the rows are not cut before. Now, without the -no_cut_row parameter, the tool will create a route blockage over the place blockage and the inst. With the -no_cut_row parameter, the tool will not create route blockage over them.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Default: false  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a routing blockage on layer M2. The route blockages align to track layer M2:   createRouteBlkAlongTrack -layer M2 -align_track M3 -edge_shrink {5 5}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
