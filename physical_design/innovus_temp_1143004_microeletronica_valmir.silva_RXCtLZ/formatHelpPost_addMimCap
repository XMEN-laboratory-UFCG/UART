.SH Name \fBaddMimCap\fR \-  Adds Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) cap cell(s) into the design
.SH Syntax \fBaddMimCap\fR  [-help]  -cell <cellName>  [-orient <orientation>]   [-prefix <prefixName>]   [{-stepX <step_in_microns> -stepY <step_in_microns>}   [-area {x1 y1 x2 y2}]][{-area {x1 y1 x2 y2} | -loc {x y}}] [-loc {x y} | -offset {x y}]
.P Adds Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) cap cell(s) into the design. This command is used before placing the standard cells. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-area x1 y1 x2 y2\fR" Specifies the area in which MIM caps are to be inserted. If no area is specifies, MIM caps will be inserted in the complete core area. This option must be used in conjunction with -stepX and -stepY and is mutually exclusive with -loc.  "\fB-cell <cellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the MIM cap cell.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each addMimCap parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man addMimCap.  "\fB-loc {x y}\fR" Inserts MIM cap cell at the specified location.   "\fB-offset {x y}\fR" Specifies the offset in microns from the origin, in horizontal and vertical directions. If the -area parameter is specified, the origin is (x1, y1) of the box defined by -area. If -area is not specified, the origin is (0,0). This option must be used in conjunction with -stepX and -stepY and is mutually exclusive with -loc.  "\fB-orient <orientation>\fR" Specifies the orientation for the inserted MIM cap cell(s).  Default: R0  "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Specifies the prefix for the inserted MIM cap cells.  "\fB-stepX <step_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance between MIM cap cells in the horizontal direction. This option must be used together with -stepY and is mutually exclusive with -loc.   "\fB-stepY <step_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance between MIM cap cells in the vertical direction. This option must be used together with -stepX and is mutually exclusive with -loc.  
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command inserts the MIM cap cells of type mim_cell1 to a specific area, with a custom offset, orientation, and step:   addMimCap -cell mim_cell1 -orient R0 -stepX 34.56 -stepY 34.56 -offset { 9.317 8.336 } -area 20 20 100 100
