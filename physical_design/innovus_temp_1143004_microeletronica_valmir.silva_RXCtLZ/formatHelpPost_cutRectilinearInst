.SH Name \fBcutRectilinearInst\fR \-  Cuts partition or black box boundaries to rectilinear instances that fit blocks in a given die, without modifying the existing block area
.SH Syntax \fBcutRectilinearInst\fR   [-help]  -inst <instName>  {{-refInst <instName> [-spacingX <xvalue>] [-spacingY <yvalue>]} |   {-cutBox {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}} | {-corner <cornerValue> [-x <value> -y <value>]}}   [-pushOut <sideEdgeName>]
.P Cuts partition or black box boundaries to rectilinear instances that fit blocks in a given die, without modifying the existing block area. The command performs the rectilinear cut based on the following criteria that you specify:
.RS  "*" 2 The name of a hierarchical instance.  "*" 2 The name of a referenced instance.  "*" 2 The name of corner where the cut is to be defined.  "*" 2 The x and y offset values, in microns, from a specific corner or an overlapping area.  "*" 2 The name of a side or edge that is to be pushed out, to maintain the existing block area.
.RE
.P You can use the command at any point in the design flow 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-corner <cornerValue>\fR" Specifies the name of a corner from where the cut is to be defined. This can be lx, ly, ux, uy coordinates, or edge number in case of a rectilinear corner. Edge numbers are counted clock-wise from the lower left corner starting with 0.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-cutBox\fR" Specifies the rectilinear box that is to be cut.
.RS  "*" 2 <x1>: Specifies the lower left x coordinate of the cut area.  "*" 2 <y1>: Specifies the lower left y coordinate of the cut area.  "*" 2 x2: Specifies the upper right x coordinate of the cut area.  "*" 2 y2: Specifies the upper right y coordinate of the cut area.
.RE   Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each cutRectilinearInst parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man cutRectilinearInst  "\fB-inst <instName>\fR" Specifies the name of a hierarchical instance. The instance can be a module, an uncommitted partition or a black box.  Data_type: (inst|hinst|group)+, required  "\fB-pushOut <sideEdgeName>\fR" Specifies the x offset value, in microns, from a specified corner. Corner numbers are counted clock-wise from the lower left corner starting with 0. This can be:
.RS  "*" 2 top  "*" 2 bottom  "*" 2 left  "*" 2 right  "*" 2 rectilinear edge number
.RE   Note: If you do not specify a side or edge, the cutRectilinearInst command will not maintain the existing area and all the sides or edges are modified by default.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-refInst <instName>\fR" Specifies the name of a reference instance. The instance can be a module, an uncommitted partition, a black box or a hard macro.   Data_type: (inst|hinst|group)+, required  "\fB-spacingX <xValue>\fR" Specifies the x offset value, in microns, of the overlapping area between the specified block and the reference object.  Default: 0  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-spacingY <yValue>\fR" Specifies the y offset value, in microns, of the overlapping area between the specified block and the reference object.  Default: 0  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-x <xValue>\fR" Specifies the x offset value, in microns, from a specified corner. Corner numbers are counted clock-wise from the lower left corner starting with 0.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-y <yValue>\fR" Specifies the y offset value, in microns, from a specified corner.  Data_type: float, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2  The following command cuts away the area of proc0/rf0/u0 which overlaps proc0/cmem0/itags0/u0/id0, plus an additional 30um in the X-direction and 15um in the Y-direction resulting in the shape below:  cutRectilinearInst -inst proc0/rf0/u0 -refInst proc0/cmem0/itags0/u0/id0 -spacingX 30 -spacingY 15  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2  The following command cuts away the intersection of the module and cut box resulting in the shape below:  cutRectilinearInst -inst proc0/rf0/u0 -cutBox 430 320 670 560  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command ccuts the module at corner number 2. The cut is 100um in the X-direction and 200um in the Y-direction:  cutRectilinearInst -inst proc0/rf0/u0 -corner 2 -x 100 -y 200  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2  The command following cuts the module at corner number 2. The cut is 100um in the X-direction and 200um in the Y-direction. The area is maintained by pushing out the left edge (notice utilization of 50% is maintained):  cutRectilinearInst -inst proc0/rf0/u0 -corner 2 -x 100 -y 200 -pushOut left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
