.SH Name \fBcreateWhatIfInternalGeneratedClock\fR \-  Creates an internal pin on a blackbox or a blackblob, and creates a generated clock on this internal pin
.SH Syntax \fBcreateWhatIfInternalGeneratedClock\fR  <blackBoxCellName>  [-help]   -clockName <genClkName>  -clockPin <internalPinName>   -masterPin <clockInputPort>   [-edge_shift <edge_shift_list>]  [-noCreateInternalPin]   [-invert]   {-multiplyBy <integer> | -divideBy <integer> | -edges <edge_list>} 
.P Creates an internal pin on a blackbox or a blackblob, and creates a generated clock on this internal pin. The timing graph is updated accordingly.
.P The following points apply to the usage of this command:
.RS  "*" 2 The internal pin created with this command will be treated as a clock port. This internal pin can, therefore, be used to create check arcs.   The latency of the generated clock should include the latency of the master clock. Therefore, the latency of the generated clock should be greater than or equal to the latency of the master clock.   The delay specified during defining the timing arcs from the internal pins must be greater than or equal to the generated clock latency.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 You can use the generated clock to define timing arcs--these timing arcs are used for timing analysis. Instead of the clock name, the clock pin is referenced while defining the timing arcs.   Any timing arc related to the internal pin must include the clock latencies defined on both: the internal pin and the master pin.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 You can also use this command to specify that a generated clock should be created on an existing internal pin by specifying the -noCreateInternalPin parameter.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If a cell has multiple instances, a generated clock will be defined for each instance of the cell.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 You can set the latency of the generated clock by using the setWhatIfClockLatency command. The generated clock appears in the block SDC file generated by the saveWhatIfTimingModel command.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Ensure that the latencies of the generated clock and the master clock are defined before creating any timing arc using the what-if timing analysis commands.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The internal pin and the generated clock will be treated as what-if assertions and can be deleted with the deleteWhatIfTimingAssertions command.
.RE
.P You can use this command after the module definition of the blackbox or the blackblob is available with the I/O's in the Verilog netlist. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<blackBoxCellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the blackbox or blackblob cell.  "\fB-clockName <genClkName>\fR" Specifies the name of the clock.generated on the internal pin.  "\fB-clockPin <internalPinName>\fR" Specifies the name of the pin generated inside the blackbox or blackblob.  "\fB-divideBy <integer>\fR" Specifies the frequency division factor. The generated clock period is equal to the master clock period multiplied by this parameter.  For example, if the value of this parameter is 2, the generated clock period is two times the master clock period.  This parameter takes an integer value.  "\fB-edge_shift <edge_shift_list>\fR" Specifies the amount of shift for each edge in the specified edge list.  "\fB-edges <edge_list>\fR" Specifies the list of edges from source clock to the derived clock.  "\fB-invert\fR" Inverts the source clock.  "\fB-masterPin <clockInputPort>\fR" Specifies the source from which the derived clock is generated.  Note: The source must be an existing clock port. and a clock should be available on this port.  "\fB-multiplyBy \fR" Specifies the frequency multiplication factor. The generated clock period is equal to the master clock period divided by this parameter.  For example, if the value of this parameter is 2, the generated clock period is half the master clock period.  This parameter takes an integer value.  "\fB-noCreateInternalPin\fR" Specifies that a generated clock should be created on an existing internal pin. In this case, the -clockPin <internalPinName> parameter should specify the existing internal pin.
