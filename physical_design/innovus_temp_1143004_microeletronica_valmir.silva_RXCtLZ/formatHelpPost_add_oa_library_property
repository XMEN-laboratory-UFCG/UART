.SH Name \fBadd_oa_library_property\fR \-  Adds a new property to the specified OpenAccess library
.SH Syntax \fBadd_oa_library_property\fR  [-help]   -lib <libName>   -name <prop_name>   -type {boolean integer float string}  -value <propValue>
.P Adds a new property to the specified OpenAccess library. This command cannot be used to change the value of an existing property.
.P Note: You cannot use the name techLibName for the property you are adding because this name is used by the OpenAccess infrastructure to store the property attached to the library. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each add_oa_library_property parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man add_oa_library_property.  "\fB-lib <libName>\fR" Specifies the name of the OpenAccess library to which the property has to be added.  "\fB-name <prop_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the property being created.  "\fB-type {boolean integer float string}\fR" Specifies the type of the property being created.   "\fB-value <propValue>\fR" Specifies the value to be set for property being created. The value is interpreted from the input string and converted to the specified type. 
.SH Example
.P In Innovus, the following set of commands creates a library named <myLib>, adds the <prop1> property to it, and saves the design before exiting:
.P createLib myLib -attachTech adiTech
.P add_oa_lib_property -lib myLib -name prop1 -type string -value value1 
.P saveDesign -cellview {myLib block1 layout}
.P exit
.P You can now add more properties to the library in Virtuoso. When you restore the design in Innovus, all properties previously added to the library, whether in Innovus or Virtuoso, reflect correctly.
