.SH Name \fBaddTieHiLo\fR \-  Adds instances of specified tie-off cells to the logical hierarchy of the design and connects the tie-off pins of netlist instances to the tie-off pins of the added instances
.SH Syntax \fBaddTieHiLo\fR  [-help]  [-cell <cellNames>]   [-createHierPort {true | false}]   [-keepExisting {true | false}]  [-matchingPDs {true | false}]   [-postMask {true | false}]  [-powerDomain <powerDomainName>]   [-prefix <prefixName>]   [-reportHierPort {true | false}]   [-cellPin <cellName:cellPin> <>| -instancePin <fileName> | -excludePin <fileName>]
.P Adds instances of specified tie-off cells to the logical hierarchy of the design and connects the tie-off pins of netlist instances to the tie-off pins of the added instances. Thus, these instances provide the connectivity between the tie-high and tie-low pins of the netlist instances to power and ground. Use this command after placing the standard cells in the flow.
.P Note: If you omit the -powerdomain option, the command will insert tie-hilo on default power domains. To add tie-off cells to all domains, you need to use the -matchingPDs option.
.P Note: If you do not specify parameters, this command uses the global parameters specified by the setTieHiLoMode command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each addTieHiLo parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man addTieHiLo.  "\fB-cell <cellNames>\fR" Specifies the tie cells to add.  You can only specify a maximum of two tie-cells, where one cell must be a tie-high driver, and the other a tie-low driver. The two tie-cell names must be surrounded by quotation marks.  This parameter overrides cell name(s) specified by the setTieHiLoMode command.  Default: "" (empty string)  "\fB-cellPin <cellName:cellPin>\fR" Specifies the cell pins that are to be tied. The cell format could be "cellName1:cellPin cellName2:cellPin cellName3:cellPin". Only the cell pins that have tie 0/1 connections and are specified in -cellPin are changed to the tie cell. The left tie connections do not change.  Default: "" (empty string)   "\fB-createHierPort {true | false}\fR" Allows the added tie cells to connect to tie pins across hierarchical boundaries if other constraints, such as maximum fanout and maximum distance, allow it.  Default: false  "\fB-excludePin <fileName>\fR" Specifies the excludePin file name. The file format is "instanceName/instancePin". Each line in the file contains one instance pin. Only the instance pins that have tie 0/1 connections and are not defined in this file are changed to the tie cell. The left tie connections do not change.   Default: "" (empty string)  "\fB-instancePin <fileName>\fR" Specifies the instance pins file name. The file format is "instanceName/instancePin". Each line in the file contains one instance pin. Only the instance pins that have tie 0/1 connections and are defined in this file are changed to the tie cell. The left tie connections do not change.  Default: "" (empty string)  "\fB-keepExisting {true | false}\fR" When set to true, preserves the existing tie-offs, added in the previous run, in the design and adds new ones.  Default: false  "\fB-matchingPDs {true | false}\fR" Adds tie-off cells to all power domains that have library binding containing the specified tie-off cell(s).  Default: false  "\fB-postMask {true | false}\fR" Insert tie cells in post mask flow. Instructs the software to reuse existing tie cells to tie off a newly created spare instance in the design instead of adding or deleting tie cells. Searches for input pins that are tied to logical 1 or logical 0 and attempts to tie them off to tie high or tie low cells.  Default: false  "\fB-powerDomain <powerDomainName>\fR" Inserts tie-off cell to the named PD.  Default: "" (empty string)  Note: When this option is not specified, tool only inserts tie cells in the "default" power domain  "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Specifies a prefix for the added tie-cell instances.  Default: "" (empty string)  "\fB-reportHierPort {true | false}\fR" When the value of -createHierPort is  true, reports created port connections to a file named  tiehilo.rpt.  Default:  false 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds tie-high and tie-low connectivity for designs with libraries that have cell named TIEOFF that provides both tie-high and tie-low connections. The instances added are prefixed with tieOff:   addTieHiLo -cell TIEOFF -prefix tieOff
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds tie-high and tie-low connectivity for designs with libraries that have separate tie-high and tie-low cells named TIEHI and TIELO respectively:   addTieHiLo -cell "TIEHI TIELO"
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands add tie-off connectivity for MSV designs with two power domains named PD1 and PD2. The last command is necessary for the part of the design that is not in either of the two specified power domains.   addTieHiLo -cell "TIEHI TIELO" -powerDomain PD1  addTieHiLo -cell "TIEHI TIELO" -powerDomain PD2  addTieHiLo -cell "TIEHI TIELO"  "*" 2 The following command add tie-off connectivity for MSV designs where all power domains whose library binding contains TIEOFF cell:  addTieHiLo -cell TIEOFF -matchingPDs true  "*" 2 The following command will connect all MUX/S and NOR/A pins that have the tie 0/1 connections to the tie cells. The left tie connections do not change.  addTieHiLo -cellPin "MUX:S NOR:A"
