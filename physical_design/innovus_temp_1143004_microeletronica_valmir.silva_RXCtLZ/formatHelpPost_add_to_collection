.P [-help]  <base_collection>  <second_collection_or_list>  [-unique]
.P Creates a new collection by adding objects from one collection to another collection. The following rules apply:
.RS  "*" 2 If all of the objects in the base collection are of the same type, only the objects in the second collection that are the same type as those in the base collection are added to the new collection. If you specify an object list instead, all of the objects in the list must be the same type as those in the base collection.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If the base collection contains different types of objects, all objects in the second collection are added. In this situation, you cannot specify an object list.
.RE
.P If the software finds no objects to add, an empty collection is returned. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB<base_collection>\fR" Specifies the base collection of objects. Objects from the second collection or object list are added to this collection to create the new collection.  "\fB<second_collection_or_list>\fR" Specifies the second object collection, or a list of objects.  "\fB-unique\fR" Removes any duplicate objects from the new collection.
