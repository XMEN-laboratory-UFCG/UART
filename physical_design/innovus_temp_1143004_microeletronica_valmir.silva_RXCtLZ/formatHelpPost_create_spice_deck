.P Generates the SPICE trace for a path.
.P While generating a Spice Deck, the create_spice_deck command looks for library cells required to run Spice and adds all cells as ".include" in the generated Spice netlist.
.P The output SPICE deck includes:
.RS  "*" 2 Active and passive devices such as field-effect transistors (FETs), capacitors, and resistors.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Initial conditions and voltage sources
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Actual names of the gates, nets, and cell instances, which helps the simulator interpret this information effectively. For example, consider the following excerpt, which shows an entry for a gate named U0 in the SPICE deck:   *Gate U0  *--------------------  *Cell ports in order : x a VSS VDD  *--------------------  XU0 U0/x U0/a 0 U0/VDD inv_ahvt_64  *--------------------
.RE
.P Note: In order to output a Spice deck that generates the same report output as the report_timing command, you must run the create_spice_deck command with the -report_timing, -segment_start, and -segment_end parameters. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-add_side_load_measurement {true | false}\fR" Adds the side load measurement in clock mesh Spice deck.  By default, Innovus only measures the latencies, delays, and slews of arcs that are part of clock mesh specified using the -from/-to parameters.  When set to true, the software additionally measures the latencies and slews of the side recievers at each stage.  Default: false  "\fB-add_voltage_for_missing_sensitization\fR" Adds the voltage for missing sensitization.   "\fB-bbox_cells <string>\fR" Specifies the list of cells to be considered as black boxes for SPICE simulations.  This parameter enables you to continue with the simulations even if subckts are missing for one or more cells. All the instantiations of these cells will be replaced by pin caps to replace the input pins connectivity of black-boxes, and the software computed PWL waveforms applied at the output pins of black boxes.  The SPICE delays/slews reported for these blackboxes will be the software computed values.  "\fB-depth <integer>\fR" Creates a clock mesh Spice deck of the specified stage depth.  Innovus only traces the clock mesh up to the user-specified depth, starting from the specified -from pin.  If both the -depth and -to parameters are specified, then Innovus generates the deck till the depth which is minimum of the -to pin depth and the user-specified depth.  "\fB-enable_arrival_measurements {true | false}\fR" Allows adding arrival measurements.  "\fB-enable_fast_simulation {true | false}\fR" When set to true, the software enables the fast simulation mode. In this mode, additional clock cycles are not required to initialize sequential cells in the Spice deck - this speeds up Spice simulations. All the sequential cells are initialized using the initial conditions and only a single clock edge is applied as input.  By default, this parameter is set to false. In this mode, two clock cycles are applied as input to the clock network, where the first triggering edge is used for initialization of sequential cells, and the second edge is used for delay measurement.   "\fB-enable_spectre_x {true | false}\fR" Enables the spectreX license checkout when launching Spectre.   "\fB-exclude_side_load_cells <string>\fR" Specifies a list of cells for which the pin capacitance will be used for side loads instead of instantiating them.  "\fB-exclude_side_load_cells_for_missing_subckt {true | false}\fR" When set to true, the software will add side load pin capacitance for missing Spice subckt cell instead of instantiating it.   "\fB-file_prefix <string>\fR" Adds the specified prefix to the generated Spice deck files.  If this parameter is not used, one of the following default names of the generated Spice decks will be used:
.RS  "*" 2 path_<index>_setup.sp: for setup paths  "*" 2 path_<index>_hold.sp: for hold paths  "*" 2 path_<index>_vl_glitch.sp: for VL glitch  "*" 2 path_<index>_vh_glitch.sp: for VH glitch
.RE   The <index> in the above file names is controlled based on the number of decks that are generated using the create_spice_deck command.  A user-specified string (specified using this parameter) is used as a prefix to the above mentioned file names.  "\fB-force_delete_output_dir\fR" Removes the directory specified by the user using the -outdir parameter.   "\fB-format <string>\fR" Allows you to make changes to the run path simulation internal reporting format.  The format columns should be compatible with the report_timing_format settings.  "\fB-from <string>\fR" Creates the Spice deck with mesh net starting from the specified pin.  "\fB-from_fall <string>\fR" Creates the Spice deck with mesh net starting from the falling transition of the specified from pin.   "\fB-from_rise <string>\fR" Creates the Spice deck with mesh net starting from the rising transition of the specified from pin.   "\fB-generate_output_only {true | false}\fR" Generates the report output only, without triggering any simulations.  Default: false  "\fB-glitch_simulation_mode {input_output | output}\fR" Specifies the glitch simulation mode.  When set to input_output, the software uses both the RIP and ROP for Spice calculations. When output is specified, the Spice ROP will be computed using the RIP.  "\fB-ground <string>\fR" Specifies a list of ground nodes.   "\fB-include_cell_variation {true | false}\fR" Writes out the Spice deck required to run simulations.  When set to true, the software runs Monte-Carlo simulations from within the Tempus software.  Default: false  "\fB-lsf_job_string <string>\fR" Specifies a handle to the farm job for launching the simulation.  "\fB-mc_simulation_init_args <string>\fR" Passes necessary Monte Carlo parameters that are required to run MC simulations. The Monte Carlo analysis refers to statistics blocks, where statistical distributions and correlations of netlist parameters are specified. This parameter initializes these parameters under the statistics block.  Note: This parameter can be used when -include_cell_variation is set to true.   "\fB-mc_simulation_tran_args <string>\fR" Initializes full transient time of simulation and transient time step.    "\fB-measure_point {all | path | stage}\fR" Specifies whether to add all, path, or stage measurements.  Default: all  "\fB-merge_spice_deck {true | false}\fR" Allows you to enable merged Spice deck.  "\fB-model_file <string>\fR" Specifies the path of SPICE model files, which contains spice model information. This information is necessary to get accurate Spice information.  If sub-circuit and model files are not provided and cdBs are available, spice information is dumped using cdB.  "\fB-no_hard_stop_at_to_pins {true | false}\fR" When set to false (default mode), the Spice deck is generated only for traced paths starting from the -from pin and ending at the -to pin. It does not traverse through the fanout branches that do not lead to the -to specified pin.  When set to true, traversal occurs through the whole fanout cone of the -from pin till it hits a clock pin of a flop, or any stop point specified with the -to parameter, or passes through a depth specified with the -depth parameter.  "\fB-outdir <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the output directory that will contain the generated delay and/or glitch spice decks.  If simulation is also performed using the -run_simulation parameter, the Spice simulations output will also be saved in this directory.  "\fB-power <string>\fR" Specifies the list of global names for the power nets.  If the -power and -ground parameters are not specified, the software obtains this information from the power/ground supplies set via other ways in the design, such as, from the libraries/cdb, and so on.  If the information is not available, the software uses the default list of power node names (VDD and VCC) and ground node names (GND and VSS).  "\fB-receiver_pin <string>\fR" Specifies the list of receiver pins for which glitch Spice decks need to be generated.  When used with the -run_simulation parameter, the software writes out a comparison report comparing various glitch parameters between Innovus and Spice, such as RIP, input glitch area, and ROP (only if ROP node name is available in the noise models) for the given receiver pins.  "\fB-report_noise <string>\fR" Specifies the report_noise command parameters as a list of arguments within brackets.  When specified, the Spice deck will be generated for all the receiver pins that are reported by the report_noise command for the specified options.  When specified with the -run_simulation parameter, the software writes out a comparison report comparing various glitch parameters between Innovus and Spice, such as, RIP, input glitch area, and ROP (only if ROP node name is available in the noise models).  "\fB-report_timing <string>\fR" Specifies the report_timing command options as a list of arguments within curly brackets.  You can use this option to define the paths for which to generate a Spice trace. To select the paths for generating the Spice trace, specify the report_timing command options, as shown:  create_spice_deck -report_timing {-clock_from CLK -clock_to CPU_CLK -nworst 2}  When the -report_timing option is not used, the software generates a Spice trace for the worst path identified by the report_timing command.  If the -path_type {full_clock} is used, then the clock path will also be processed.  See the report_timing command for a complete list of options that can be used as arguments with the -report_timing option.  Note: The end and summary values of the -path_type option of report_timing are not supported.  "\fB-run_simulation\fR" Enables path simulation in addition to generating Spice Deck.  "\fB-segment {data_path | launch_path launch_clock_path | capture_path all}\fR" Creates the Spice deck of a segment out of the path spice deck.  The following command/global variable settings have the following impact on the -segment parameter options:
.RS  "*" 2 -path_type full_clock is defined under the create_spice_deck-report_timing parameter, then the -segment default value is launch_path.  "*" 2 -path_type full_clock is not specified, then default value is data_path.  "*" 2 timing_disable_retime_clock_path_slew_propagation global variable is set to false, the default value is launch_path (irrespective of -path_type settings).  "*" 2 timing_disable_retime_clock_path_slew_propagation global variable is set to true (default), then launch_clock_path and capture_path options are supported only when the -path_typefull_clock option of the create_spice_deck-report_timing parameter is used.
.RE   "\fB-segment_end <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the segment end term.  "\fB-segment_start <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the segment start term.   "\fB-side_path_level <integer>\fR" Specifies the number of levels of side path stages to be included in the Spice trace. The maximum number of levels that can be specified is 4.  Default: 1  "\fB-spectre <string>\fR" Specifies the location of the Spectre version that should be used for simulation. If the path is not specified with this option, the software will check if you have the Spectre location defined in your path.  "\fB-spectre_analysis_options <string>\fR" Adds Spectre analysis options to the run. When specified, the software provides instructions to Spectre, e.g., run a session with extra accuracy.   "\fB-spectre_cmd_options <string>\fR" Specifies the command line options for Spectre.   "\fB-spectre_lang_escape_chars <string>\fR" Specifies a list of escape characters in Spectre.   "\fB-spice_include <string>\fR" Specifies the user-defined lines that should be written to the Spice deck.  For example,  create_spice_deck -spice_include {.include extra_cmds.sp}  where extra_cmds.sp includes additional SPICE commands that are required for the run and are not included in the SPICE model file loaded with the -models parameter.  "\fB-stimuli_file <string>\fR" Allows you to specify the file path containing stimuli to be used for the specified library cells. The cells' sensitization coming from the user-specified stimuli file takes precedence over the software inferred sensitization.  Syntax for delay Spice decks is given below:  lib_cell <string> <from | from_rise | from_fall> <string> <to | to_rise | to_fall> <string> input_vector <string> num_clk_pulse <integer>  Syntax for glitch Spice decks is given below:  lib_cell <string> glitch_type <VL | VH> output_pin <string> input_vector <string> num_clk_pulse <integer> # For victim driver sensitization  lib_cell <cell_name> glitch_type <VL | VH> input_pin <string> input_vector <string> num_clk_pulse <integer> # For victim receiver sensitization  The num_clock_pulse <integer> holds significance in case of sequential arcs, and specifies where to align the data pin transition with respect to the clock transition.   For example, a value of '1' (default setting) specifies that the data pin transition needs to be aligned before the last clock transition where delay measurement is intended. This value can be used in case of regular flip-flops.  The value '2' specifies that data pin transition needs to be aligned with respect to the second-last triggering clock edge. This value can be used for cascaded 2-bit flip flops.  Additionally for sequential arcs, the first pin in the user-specified input vector needs to be the data pin, the signal of which will be latched in the sequential cell.  Here are some examples of stimuli file:
.RS  "*" 2 The following example shows the stimuli file containing sensitizations for CP(rise)->Q(fall) and CP(rise)->Q(rise) timing arcs of library cell FF1:  lib_cell FF1 from_rise CP to_fall Q input_vector !D&CDN&!SE&!SI num_clk_pulse 2   lib_cell FF1 from_rise CP to_rise Q input_vector D&CDN&!SE&!SI num_clk_pulse 2
.RE

"\fB-use_control_param {true | false}\fR" Allows you to control the power/ground voltage levels in the created Spice deck through user-specified parameters.  When set to true, an additional file with the same name as the deck, and extension
.control is created that contains the parameterized design voltage levels of the PG pins of all the cells instantiated in the deck. Your can modify the *.control file as per the requirement without modifying the original deck.  "\fB-use_distributed_load_for_side_receivers {true | false}\fR" Allows you to control whether to use the receiver output load as distributed or lumped load.  Default: false  "\fB-user_defined_measure_statements {append | overwrite}\fR" Specifies whether to overwrite the default measurement statements in the Spice deck by user-defined measurements specified using the -user_defined_measure_statements_file parameter, or append it with default measure statements.  Default: append  "\fB-user_defined_measure_statements_file <string>\fR" Allows you to add the delay/slew measurement statements for any given segement of the path for which Spice deck is generated.  The format of the file is given below:  <MEASURE_TAG_NAME TRIGGER_PIN_NAME TARGET_PIN_NAME>  Multiple such lines with unique tags can be specified in the file.  The measure statement is written in the Spice deck for delay measurement between TRIGGER_PIN and TARGET_PIN, and slew measurement at TARGET_PIN.  "\fB-view <string>\fR" Specifies the view name - if a glitch Spice deck is created for a view other than the default view.  "\fB-waveform_aware_pulse_width_checks {true | false}\fR" Generates the Spice deck for waveform-aware pulse width checks.   "\fB-xtalk {delay | vl_glitch | vh_glitch | vlu_glitch | vho_glitch}  \fR" Generates the SI Spice deck for the stage specified using the report_timing parameter.
.RS  "*" 2 A stage can start with victim driver input to victim receiver input.  "*" 2 A stage can start with victim driver input to victim receiver output.
.RE   The stage will be specified in the report_timing command using the -point_to_point parameter.  You can specify one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 delay: Allows to dump the SI delay Spice deck.  "*" 2 vl_glitch | vh_glitch: Specifies the type of glitch (VL or VH) the Spice deck will be used for. This option must be used for glitch Spice deck generation.  "*" 2 vlu_glitch | vho_glitch: Supports simulation of vlu/vho glitches.

.P Note: The DELAY and SLEW keywords in the MEASURE statements indicate that these are the measurement statements for delay and slew respectively.
.P Also, Stage numbers (Stage_0001 and Stage_0002) in the MEASURE statement indicate the respective stages; first and second stage, in the timing path, which makes it easier for correlation with the report_timing report.
