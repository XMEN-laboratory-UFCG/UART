.SH Name \fBcreate_flexfiller_route_blockage\fR \-  Generates default congestion model to estimate routing blockages over FlexFillers based on user-specified percentage value for characterizing
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_flexfiller_route_blockage\fR   [-help]  
.P Generates default congestion model to estimate routing blockages over FlexFillers based on user-specified percentage value for characterizing.  This command can handle both module-based and instance group-based FlexModels. Routing blockage value of an instance group-based FlexModels will be derived based on its parent module routing blockage value. You should run this command when models are already created.
.P Note: This command should be used for Active-logic Reduction technique (ART) based model generation flow. For non ART based flow, congestion model can be created during create_proto_model command.
.P Note: The FlexFillers generation capability supports hybrid rows and generates FlexFillers that can fit in the floorplan rows and can be placed legally in the floorplan. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_flexfiller_route_blockage parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command: man create_flexfiller_route_blockage. 
.SH    Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following example indicates that 10% of created models will be used for routing blockage characterization:  create_flexfiller_route_blockage
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example indicates that 80% of created flexmodels will be used for routing blockage characterization and tdsp_core and alu modules should be part of these 80% models:  set_proto_mode -include_model_route_blockage {tdsp_core alu}  set_proto_mode -characterize_percent_rt_blockage 0.8  create_flexfiller_route_blockage
