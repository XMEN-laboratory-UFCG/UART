.SH Name \fBaddIoInstance\fR \-  Specifies constraints for insertion of power and ground I/O instances in the I/O ring or in the I/O rows

.P Specifies constraints for insertion of power and ground I/O instances in the I/O ring or in the I/O rows. This command inserts physical IO cells into design following constraints. It is used during floorplanning. If you do not specify any of the following parameters, the command addIoInstance adds I/Os for all I/O cells, on all sides and for all I/O rings.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-ccw\fR" Specifies the counter-clockwise direction to add the new I/O instance.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-cell {<name1 name2
...>}  \fR" Specifies one or more cells. Adds one I/O for each cell that was specified.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each addIoInstance parameter.For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man addIoInstance  "\fB-inSelected\fR" Repeatedly inserts new I/O instance(s) within the selected I/O cell(s).  Data_type: bool, required  "\fB-inst {<inst1 inst2
...>}  \fR" Specifies the instance name prefix for the new I/O. This must match with the number of cells that are specified.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-ioRing <num>\fR" Specifies the I/O ring number in which the new I/O instance is added.  Default: 0  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-ioRow <name>\fR" For the new I/O row flow, adds I/Os on the specified I/O row.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-loc <x y>  \fR" Adds the new I/O instance at the location specified by x y coordinates.  Note: You cannot use this parameter in conjunction with the -refInst or -selected parameters.  Data_type: point, required  "\fB-orientation <orient>  \fR" Specifies the orientation of the new I/O instance. You can specify one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 R0  "*" 2 R90  "*" 2 R180  "*" 2 R270  "*" 2 MX90  "*" 2 MY90  "*" 2 MX  "*" 2 MY
.RE   Default: R0  Use this parameter with -cell and -loc parameters.  Note: When specifying the -refInst or -selected parameters, the software uses the orientation from those instances.  See OrientationKey for more information.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-refInst <inst_name>  \fR" Specifies the name of the reference instance and adds the new I/O instance above or below the reference instance in clockwise direction.  Default: Clockwise direction of the reference instance.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-repeat <num>\fR" Repeatedly adds new I/O instances every number (num) of cells that you specify.  Default: Adds instances in the clockwise direction of the reference instance.  Data_type: int, required  "\fB-selected\fR" If -repeat is specified, this parameter adds the new I/O instance(s) in the selected cell(s) in clockwise direction of the selected instance. If -repeat is not specified, this parameter changes the selected cells as referenced cells and adds new I/O instances in the referenced cells, in the default clockwise direction.  Data_type: bool, required  "\fB-side {N | W | S | E}  \fR" Specifies the side on which the new I/O instance is added.  Default: N  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-skip <num>\fR" Skips the number (num) of cells specified, before adding the first I/O instance. This happens only when -repeat num is specified.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-spacing <val>\fR" Specifies the spacing value, in microns, between the I/O instances.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-spread\fR" Evenly replaces all the I/O cells on the same row where the new I/O instance was added. This prevents overlapping of I/O cells. If you do not specify this parameter, the command still adds the new I/Os even if overlapping occurs.  Note: The addIoInstance command works for both the I/O flows, the old flow and the new row based pad placement flow. In the new flow, each time you add a new I/O instance, the I/Os on the I/O rows with the existing constraints are replaced. In this situation, if all the existing I/Os do not have any specific constraint defined, then the replacement of the I/Os also resolves overlapping each time when the I/O cell is added, evading the usage of -spread option.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds new I/O instance il to cell BUMPCELL at lower-left x location 100 and lower-left y location 100:   addIoInstance -inst il -cell BUMPCELL -loc 100 100
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command inserts the I/O instance newIo for the cell PVDD on the West side of the I/O box, skipping 3 I/O's (from below) on the West side and repeating the insertion of I/O's every 2 instances.   addIoInstance -cell PVDD -repeat 2 -inst newIo -side W -skip 3 -spread
