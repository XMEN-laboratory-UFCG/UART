.SH Name \fBassignTSV\fR \-  Assigns nets to TSVs and/or frontside and backside bumps, and/or feedthrus
.SH Syntax \fBassignTSV\fR  [-help]  [-write_down_level_bump]   [-selected <netName> | [[-signal | -pgpad ] [-feedthru | -nonFeedthru ] [-net <netlist> | -exclude_net <excludeNetList>] [-area <llx lly urx ury
...>] [-exclude_region <llx lly urx ury
...>] [-tsvViaName <tsvViaCellName>] [-interposer ] ] ]   [{[-backBump ] [-frontBump ]} [-force_current_die ]] 
.P Assigns nets to TSVs and/or frontside and backside bumps, and/or feedthrus. The command considers all dies in the 3D IC System by using the die abstract files, and optimizes bump assignment for the global nets which connect these dies. If you run the readDieAbstract command to import die abstract files of other chips inside the 3D IC System before running the assignTSV command, assignTSV will optimize TSV/bump assignment by considering the whole system.
.P Note: Use this command after the TSVs and bumps are created and the instances connected with the IO pins are placed. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Print out the command usage.  "\fB-backBump\fR" Declares that the back side bumps and the TSVs will be assigned automatically.  "\fB-force_current_die\fR" Assigns all IO pins to backside bumps or frontside bump directly without checking the XML file and the top level netlist.  You can use -force_current_die only if -backBump or -frontBump is specified.  "\fB-frontBump\fR" Declares that the front side bumps will be assigned with the IO pins automatically.  "\fB-tsvViaName <tsvViaCellName>\fR" If this option is specified, only the TSV with the VIA cell tsvViaCellName will be assigned. Others will be ignored.  "\fB-selected <netName>\fR" Assigns the selected TSVs and bumps with a specified net.  Note: If the selected TSV belongs to a feedthru, the whole feedthru will be assigned with the net.  This option is used for manual assignment and is exclusive to any other options for auto assignment.  "\fB-signal\fR" Declares that only signal will be assigned.  "\fB-pgpad\fR" Declares that only power/ground net will be assigned.  "\fB-feedthru\fR" Declares that the command assigns only the feedthru net.  "\fB-nonFeedthru\fR" Declares that the command assigns only the nonfeedthru signal or power/ground net.  "\fB-net <netlist>\fR" Assigns the specified nets to the near TSV/bumps.  "\fB-exclude_net <excludenetlist>\fR" Excludes the nets in the specified boxes.  "\fB-area {<llx lly urx ury>
...}\fR" Assigns the TSV/bump within the box only.  "\fB-exclude_region {<llx lly urx ury>
...}\fR" Excludes the TSV/bumps in the specified boxes.  "\fB-interposer\fR" Declares that the assignment is done in silicon interposer without any instance.  "\fB-write_down_level_bump\fR" Writes down the level bump file for each hierarchical instance.
.P Notes: 
.RS  "*" 2 If neither -signal nor -pgpad is specified, both signal and pgpad will be assigned.  "*" 2 If neither -feedthru nor -nonFeedthru is specified, both feedthru and non-feedthru net will be assigned.  "*" 2 If neither -frontBump nor -backBump is selected, none of the bumps will be assigned. However, the TSV will still be assigned.
