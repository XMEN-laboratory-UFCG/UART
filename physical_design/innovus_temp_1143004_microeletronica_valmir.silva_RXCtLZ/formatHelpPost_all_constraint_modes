.TH all_constraint_modes  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBall_constraint_modes\fR \-  Returns a Tcl list of all defined constraint modes in the design
.SH Syntax  \fBall_constraint_modes\fR [-active | -active_setup | -active_hold] 
.P Returns a Tcl list of all defined constraint modes in the design.
.P Use this command after creating multiple constraint modes (create_constraint_mode). 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-active\fR" Returns a list of the defined constraint modes associated with all active analysis views.  "\fB-active_setup\fR" Returns a list of the defined constraint modes associated with active setup analysis views only.  "\fB-active_hold\fR" Returns a list of the defined constraint modes associated with active hold analysis views only. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands create constraint modes missionSetup and missionHold:
.RE
.P create_constraint_mode -name missionSetup   -sdc_files [list io.sdc mission1-clks.sdc mission1-except.sdc]
.P create_constraint_mode -name missionHold   -sdc_files [list io.sdc mission1-clks.sdc mission1-except.sdc      dont_use.sdc]
.RS  "*" 2 The following command returns a list all the defined constraints modes in the design:   all_constraint_modes  The software returns the following results:  {missionSetup missionHold}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command returns a list of all the defined constraint modes associated with the active setup analysis views in the design:   all_constraint_modes -active_setup
