.TH createUserBundleNet  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreateUserBundleNet\fR \-  Creates a bundle of specified nets that can be displayed as flightlines
.SH Syntax \fBcreateUserBundleNet\fR  [-help]   <name>  -nets <listOfNets>  <-object1> <string>-object2<> <string>
.P Creates a bundle of specified nets that can be displayed as flightlines. Bundled nets help you with data flow analysis before and after layout. Net bundles can be created and viewed in floorplan and amoeba views. Each custom net bundle displays the number of nets in it and works for macros, blobs, and giudes.
.P Using createUserBundleNet, you can create custom bundled nets that allow you to define your own net bundles as per your requirements. This is useful while debugging physical properties of interconnects within a complicated hierarchical design because you can define start and end points of a net bundle. As a result, you can create and display only relevant flightlines, instead of looking at all the flightlines of specified nets.
.P Note: One net can be part of multiple net bundles simultaneously.
.P You can display flightline net bundles using the displayUserBundleNet command and delete them using the deleteUserBundleNet command.
.P Note: You can choose to display flightlines for only bundled nets by using the Show Net Bundle FlightLine Only option in the Preferences form. If this option is not selected, the net bundle flightlines are displayed along with other selection-based flightlines by default. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each createUserBundleNet parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man createUserBundleNet  "\fB<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the custom net bundle.  "\fB-nets <listOfNets>\fR" Specifies the list of nets to be included in the net bundle. You can use patterns with wildcards to specify net names. All the nets that match the specified pattern are put in the same bundle.  "\fB-object1 <string>\fR" Specifies the name of object which is the start point of the nets. The object type includes module, block, black box, and IO pad.   "\fB-object2 <string>\fR" Specifies the name of object which is the end point of the nets. The object type includes module, block, black box, and IO pad. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a bundle called bundle_1, which contains flightlines of nets net_1 and net_2:   createUserBundleNet bundle_1 -nets {net_1 net_2} -object1 Module1 -object2 Module2  You can then use the displayUserBundleNet command to display bundle_1 flightlines as follows:  displayUserBundleNet -netBundle bundle_1
