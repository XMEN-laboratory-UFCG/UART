.SH Name \fBaddFillerGap\fR \-  Moves placed standard cell instances to create gaps so that filler cells can be added
.SH Syntax \fBaddFillerGap\fR  <minGap>  [-effort {none | low | medium | high}]  [-radius <micron>] 
.P Moves placed standard cell instances to create gaps so that filler cells can be added. Tries to move cells to create a gap of the specified size. If enough space is not available, moves cells until they touch each other. If a gap already exists, and it is larger than the specified size, the command does not move cells to make it smaller.
.P By default, this command deletes all routing, because the routing is no longer valid due to the movement of the cells. To override this behavior, specify the following command:
.P setPlaceMode -place_detail_preserve_routing true
.P This command has the following limitations:
.RS  "*" 2 It does not moved FIXED cells.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 It does not guarantee to that all gaps will be larger than the specified minimum gap size.
.RE
.P Use this command after placement and before routing. 
.SH Parameters     "\fB<minGap>\fR" Specifies the minimum-size gap in which a filler cell can be added. Unit is micron.  "\fB-effort {none | low| medium | high}\fR" Specifies the effort the command needs to spend for honoring the given gap constraint.
.RS  "*" 2 none effort specifies that no standard cell is moved for honoring the giving gap constraint.  "*" 2 low effort specifies that only single height standard cells can be moved within the same row.  "*" 2 medium effort specifies that only single height standard cells can be moved across the rows.  "*" 2 high effort specifies that the standard cells can be moved across rows, and double height standard cells can be moved within the same row.
.RE   Default: low  "\fB-radius <micron>\fR" Specifies the searching radius when solving the minimum filler gap.  Default: 16 
.SH Example
.P The following command moves standard cells within a row to create gaps of at least two microns between the cells:
.P addFillerGap 0.168
