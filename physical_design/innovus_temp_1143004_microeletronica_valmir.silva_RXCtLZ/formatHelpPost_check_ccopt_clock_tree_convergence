.SH Name \fBcheck_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence\fR \-  This command is used to trigger a warning message for sinks that have more than the specified number of convergence paths from the clock sources to the sink
.SH Syntax \fBcheck_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence\fR    [-help]   [-warnthreshold <thresholdValue>]
.P This command is used to trigger a warning message for sinks that have more than the specified number of convergence paths from the clock sources to the sink. This check is performed at the end of clock tree specification, for complex convergence above sinks that might cause large runtimes in CCOpt as it attempts to balance these trees.
.P When this command is specified, any sinks that are found to have more than the specified <thresholdvalue> of paths from the clock sources to the sink are reported in a warning message from the software. For example:
.P WARN: (IMPCCOPT-4338): There are 17 clock paths leading to primaryout. This may cause long CCOpt runtimes. Type 'man IMPCCOPT-4338' for more detail.
.P The following detailed information is provided when you type man IMPCCOPT-4338:
.P The design contains a lot of converging clock paths leading to some sinks. This may cause long CCOpt runtimes. The sinks with the most paths leading to them can be found with report_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence. See CCOpt Clock Tree Specification under Clock Concurrent Optimization in the User Guide for more information.
.P Note: The warning is issued if the number of clock paths to any sink is greater than the threshold value of paths specified by the command check_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence.
.P To view a summary of the convergence above clock sinks and to identify the names of the sinks with the highest number of clock network paths, run the  report_ccopt_clock_tree_convergencecommand. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help       \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each check_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man check_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence.   "\fB-warnthreshold <thresholdValue>  \fR" Triggers a warning message for sinks with more than the specified number of paths.  Default: 100
