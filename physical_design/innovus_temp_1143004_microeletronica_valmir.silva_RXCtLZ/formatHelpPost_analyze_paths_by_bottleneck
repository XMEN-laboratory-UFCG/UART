.SH Name \fBanalyze_paths_by_bottleneck\fR \-  Creates categories according to the bottleneck analysis of the critical paths and fixes the violation according to the bottleneck information
.SH Syntax  \fBanalyze_paths_by_bottleneck\fR  [-help]  {-category <n> | -incr_delay {worst|total}}  [-path_num <m>]   [-max_slack <float>]  [-min_slack <float>]  [-master <master_category_name>] 
.P Creates categories according to the bottleneck analysis of the critical paths and fixes the violation according to the bottleneck information. Bottleneck Analysis detects the instances that are often involved in the critical paths in the design. Any change in timing for these instances impacts multiple critical paths in the design. Therefore you can use this information to change your design (floorplan, placement, constraints etc.) around these instances. The bottleneck analysis computes the number of occurrences that an instance appears in the paths that you display in the Timing Debug window, and provides the following output:
.RS  "*" 2 Colors most used instance based on number of occurrences.  "*" 2 Creates <n> number of path categories for the instances with the highest number of occurrences. <n> is the number you specify using the -category parameter.
.RE
.P Users can also perform bottleneck analysis of the critical paths based on incremental delay. Categories will be created based on the worst <m> paths with:
.RS  "*" 2 The biggest worst incr_delay contribution  "*" 2 The biggest total incr_delay contribution
.RE
.P The command can be applied wherever the user loads the machine readable timing report. To delete the path categories created by this command, use delete_path_category.
.P For more information on creating path categories, see "Creating Path Categories" in the Debugging Timing Results chapter of User Guide.
.P Note: The categories created by analyze_paths_by_bottleneck cannot be saved using the save_path_categories command. Additionally, the related sub-categories will not be saved. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each analyze_paths_by_bottleneck parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man analyze_paths_by_bottleneck  "\fB-category <n>\fR" Specifies the number of categories to be created for most occurring instances.  "\fB-incr_delay {worst|total}\fR" Specifies that the categories are created based on worst incr_delay contribution or total incr_delay contribution.  "\fB-master <master_category_name>\fR" Specifies that the analysis should be performed only for the specified master category.  "\fB-max_slack <float>\fR" Specifies the max slack value of the critical paths for bottleneck analysis based on incr_delay.  "\fB-min_slack <float>\fR" Specifies the min slack value of the critical paths for bottleneck analysis based on incr_delay.   "\fB-path_num <m>\fR" Specifies the number of critical paths to be analyzed when performing bottleneck analysis based on incr_delay. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates path categories based on bottleneck analysis of the critical paths on the instances:   analyze_paths_by_bottleneck -category 2  The following categories are created: BOT_instance1 and BOT_instance2. You can change the number of categories.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates path categories based on bottleneck analysis of the critical 20 paths on the worst incr_delay:   analyze_paths_by_bottleneck -path_num 20 -incr_delay worst  The following category is created: BOT_SI_WORST.
