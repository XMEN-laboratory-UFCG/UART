.SH Name \fBcreate_inst_space_group\fR \-  Creates space group for instances with a specific vertical or horizontal-distance constraint
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_inst_space_group\fR  [-help]  <groupName>   -inst <listOfInstances>   {[{[ -spacing_y <Distance>] [-spacing_x <Distance>]} [-checking_box {all|cross_only}]] | [-spacing_radial <Distance>]} 
.P Creates space group for instances with a specific vertical or horizontal-distance constraint.
.P The create_inst_space_group information can be saved in DB. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-checking_box {all cross_only}\fR" Checks all area or the intersection area from -spacing_x and -spacing_y.
.RS  "*" 2 cross_only: Checks the intersection area of -spacing_x and -spacing_y. If any instance violates both -spacing_x and -spacing_y, it is marked as a violation.  "*" 2 all: Checks all area covered by spacing_x and spacing_y. If any instance violates -spacing_x or -spacing_y, it is marked as a violation. The constrained box is ended by core/blockage/power domain/hard macro/row boundary.
.RE   Default: cross_only  "\fB<groupName>\fR" Specifies the name of the group.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_inst_space_group parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man create_inst_space_group.  "\fB-inst <listOfInstances>\fR" Specifies all instances that belong to the same space group by name.   "\fB-spacing_radial <Distance>\fR" Specifies the radial distance, in microns.  "\fB-spacing_x <Distance>\fR" Specifies the distance, in microns, between each specific instance in the X direction.   "\fB-spacing_y <Distance>\fR" Specifies the distance, in microns, between each specific instance in the Y direction.
