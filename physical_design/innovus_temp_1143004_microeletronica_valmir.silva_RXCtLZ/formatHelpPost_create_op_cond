.SH Name \fBcreate_op_cond\fR \-  Creates a set of virtual operating conditions in the specified library without actually modifying the library
.SH Syntax  \fBcreate_op_cond\fR  -name <virtualOpcondName>  -library_file <libraryFileName>  -P <processValue>  -V <voltageValue>  -T <temperatureValue> 
.P Creates a set of virtual operating conditions in the specified library without actually modifying the library. These virtual operating conditions can then be referenced by a delay calculation corner (create_delay_corner) as if they actually exist in the library. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-library_file <libraryFileName>\fR" Specifies the library for which to create the virtual operating conditions.  "\fB-name <virtualOpcondName>\fR" Specifies the name for the operating condition being created.  "\fB-P <processValue>\fR" Specifies the process value for the operating condition.  "\fB-T <temperatureValue>\fR" Specifies the temperature value for the operating condition.  "\fB-V <voltageValue>\fR" Specifies the voltage value for the operating condition.
