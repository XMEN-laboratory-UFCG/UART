.SH Name \fBassignPGBumps\fR \-  Assigns power and ground bumps to connect flip chip I/O pins and adds property value onto bumps
.SH Syntax \fBassignPGBumps\fR  [-help]   [-connectType {ioring | corering | stripe | iopin}]  -nets {<name_list>}  [-selected | -floating | -bumps {<bump_name_list>}]   [-V | -H | -checkerboard [-square {<width height>}]]
.P Assigns power and ground bumps to connect flip chip I/O pins and adds property value onto bumps. Use this command after bumps are created. It overwrites existing assignments for selected bumps. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each assignPGBumps parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man assignPGBumps  "\fB  -bumps {<bump_name_list>}\fR" Specifies the names of the bumps to be assigned. The names must be enclosed in braces. Wildcards are supported in bump names.  Note: This parameter cannot be used with -selected and -floating.  "\fB-checkerboard\fR" Specifies that the checkerboard style of bump assignment will be used if multiple nets are defined using the -nets parameter:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   The -checkerboard parameter is typically used for a regular (rectangular) bump array. To apply this pattern for an irregular (rectilinear) bump array, first form a regular array by creating virtual bumps in the areas where there are no bumps. Next, assign the bumps using the checkerboard pattern and then remove the virtual bumps.   Notes
.RS  "*" 2 The checkerboard style can be used with more than two nets, as shown below:  assignPGBumps -nets {VSS1 VDD1 VDE1 VDDM} -checkerboard -selected  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  The -checkerboard option for multiple nets can be used in a regular bump matrix with the same bump cell for all bumps and the same X/Y pitch between bumps. If bumps are missing in the pattern, the tool skips assignment to maintain the diagonal, staggered net direction.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The checkerboard style can support irregular bump assignment when used with the -square parameter. For details, see the description of the -square parameter.
.RE   "\fB-connectType {ioring | corering | stripe | iopin}\fR" Specifies the bump connect type when assigning power/ground bumps. Connection type can be I/O Ring, Core Ring, Stripe, or I/O Pin.  "\fB-floating\fR" Assigns all floating bumps.  "\fB-H\fR" Specifies that the horizontal style of bump assignment will be used if multiple nets are defined using the -nets parameter:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-nets {<name_list>}\fR" Specifies the net names. Net names must be enclosed in braces.   "\fB-selected\fR" Assigns selected bumps.  "\fB-square {<width height>}\fR" Specifies the width and height of a square in the checkerboard style of bump assignment. Use this parameter if you want to apply the checkerboard style of bump assignment for an irregular bump matrix. When you specify the -square parameter, the tool creates a virtual checkerboard made of squares of the specified dimensions and then assigns the squares with the specified nets. The square to which a bump belongs is determined based on the location of its center. The tool then assigns the corresponding net to the bump.  For example, the following command creates a virtual checkerboard with squares of width 150 and height 100, assigns the squares with the Nets 1, 2, 3, and 4, and assigns the nets to bumps based on the square on which their center is located:  assignPGBumps -nets {1 2 3 4} -checkerboard -selected -square {150 100}  Case A  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   As shown in Case B below, the assignment is dependent on the location of the center of the bumps.  Case B  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   The assignment also changes if you change the dimensions specified for the checkerboard squares. For example, the following command creates a virtual checkerboard with squares of width 300 and height 100.  assignPGBumps -nets {1 2 3 4} -checkerboard -selected -square {300 100}  Case C  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note that although the bump locations are same in both Cases A and C, the assignments in Case C are different from Case A because of the change in square dimensions.  Notes
.RS  "*" 2 The -square parameter can be used only if -checkerboard is specified.   "*" 2 The -square parameter can be used for selected as well as floating bumps. 
.RE   "\fB-V\fR" Specifies that the vertical style of bump assignment will be used if multiple nets are defined using the -nets parameter:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
