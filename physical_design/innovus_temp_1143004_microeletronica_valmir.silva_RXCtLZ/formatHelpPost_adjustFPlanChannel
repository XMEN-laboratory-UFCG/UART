.TH adjustFPlanChannel  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBadjustFPlanChannel\fR \-  Automatically adjusts the channel width between objects to prevent potential routing congestion. You can use this command after importing the design, loading a completed floorplan, and then running the place_design and earlyGlobalRoute commands
.SH Syntax \fBadjustFPlanChannel\fR   [-help]   [-channelUtil <utilizationValue>]  [-constraints <constraint_file>]   [-moveOnly]  [-report <output_file>]   [-reportOnly [-report_low_utilized_channels <value>]     [-type {all fenceToFence fenceToCore fenceToMacro macroToMacro macroToCore}]] 
.P Automatically adjusts the channel width between objects to prevent potential routing congestion. You can use this command after importing the design, loading a completed floorplan, and then running the place_design and earlyGlobalRoute commands. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-channelUtil <utilizationValue>\fR"  "\fB<>\fR" Specifies the maximum utilization of routing tracks in a channel.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-constraints <constraint_file>\fR" Specifies the file that contains constraints for floorplan objects. A constraint file is a text file that can contain a list of seeds to use when generating fences and module guides, and basic relative, spacing and orientation constraints to follow during macro placement.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each adjustFPlanChannel parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man adjustFPlanChannel  "\fB-moveOnly\fR" Specifies that only move-only adjustment is allowed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-report <output_file>\fR" Generates a report that contains the channel congestion, targeted channel adjustment, and final real floorplan adjustment.  Default: topcell.channel  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-reportOnly\fR" Generates a report of the channel congestion without adjusting the floorplan.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-report_low_utilized_channels <value>\fR" Reports channel congestion whose track utilization is lower than the user-specified threshold value.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 1.0  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-type {all fenceToFence fenceToCore fenceToMacro macroToMacro macroToCore}\fR" Reports channel congestion for specified type. You can specify more than one type at a time.  Default: all  Data_type: enum_list, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates a report of only fence-to-fence congestion, without adjusting the floorplan:  adjustFPlanChannel -reportOnly -type {fenceToFence}   "*" 2 The following command generates a channel congestion report without adjusting the floorplan:  adjustFPlanChannel -reportOnly -report reportfile  The following report is generated:  Channel (315.48 357.67 361.60 511.57)   Left: CORE  Right: DTMF_INST/PLLCLK_INST  Congested utilization: 200/185 (108.1% V)   Expected channel width increase: 6.48 um  Channel (315.48 511.57 351.33 646.17)   Left: CORE  Right: DTMF_INST/RAM_128x16_TEST_INST/RAM_128x16_INST  Congested utilization: 128/117 (109.4% V)   Expected channel width increase: 5.51 um  Channel (466.52 646.17 792.28 670.01)   Bottom: DTMF_INST/RAM_128x16_TEST_INST/RAM_128x16_INST  Top: DTMF_INST/ROM_512x16_0_INST  Congested utilization: 52/42 (123.8% H)   Expected channel height increase: 7.38 um
