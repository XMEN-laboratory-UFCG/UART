.SH Name \fBcreatePipelineBusGuide\fR \-  Generates bus-guide for the pipeline netgroup
.SH Syntax \fBcreatePipelineBusGuide\fR  [-help]  [-netGroup <netGroupNames>]  [-widthFactor <value>]  [-layer <id1:id2>]  [-report <fileName>]  [-spacing <value> {-report <filename>}] 
.P Generates bus-guide for the pipeline netgroup. The bus-guide is used to guide the router for expected path. It can be used in the analysis flow or after the pipeline flops are inserted in the netlist.
.P Note: The bus-guide width is scalable by the width factor. Default width factor is 1.0. The bus width equals to the (width factor) x (the largest pitch of given routing layers) x (the number of bus bits) + 1 extra pitch. The extra pitch is added to account for the possibility that bus-guides do not line up exactly with the routing grid. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-netGroup <netGroupNames>\fR" Specifies the netgroup name(s) that the bus-guide is created for.  Default: ""  "\fB-widthFactor <value>\fR" Specifies the width factor of bus-guide.  Default: 1.0  "\fB-layer <id1:id2>\fR" Specifies the layer(s) to use for the generated bus-guide. It can be a single layer or layer range.  Default: all  "\fB-report <fileName>\fR" Specifies the analysis report file name.  Default: <filename>.rpt  "\fB-spacing <float>\fR" Specifies the maximum space between flops. Default: "" 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command writes out a report file 'busguide.rpt' which tells the total estimated length of bus (in microns), the number of stages that will be needed (based on the given spacing of 200 um), and location of each stage of PFFs for all net groups on all routing layers.   createPipelineBusGuide -spacing 200 -report busguide.rpt
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command create bus-guide for net group 'NG1' on routing layers 2, 3, and 4. The bus-guide width is 2 times the default width.   createPipelineBusGuide -netGroup NG1 -widthFactor 2.0 -layer 2:4
