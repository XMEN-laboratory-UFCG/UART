.SH Name \fBcreateExclusiveGroups\fR \-  Creates exclusive regions
.SH Syntax \fBcreateExclusiveGroups\fR   [-help]   [<group_name>]   [-gap <float>]   [-min_gap <float>]   [-exclusiveGroups <string> | -mutuallyExclusiveGroups <string>] 
.P Creates exclusive regions. Exclusive regions specified for a particular group cannot be placed/overlapped with it but they can overlap on each other/ any other region in the core area. 
.SH Sample Script
.P Following is a sample script to create exclusive groups:
.P createInstGroup $group_name  addInstToInstGroup $group_name {insts}  createInstGroup $group_name1  addInstToInstGroup $group_name1 {insts}  createExclusiveGroups $group_name -exclusiveGroups {$groups_name1}  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-exclusiveGroups <string>\fR" Specifies the groups/regions that cannot be placed/overlapped with the specified group name.  For Example:  If regions B,C,D are defined as exclusive regions to A. Instances from B,C,D can never be placed on A. Other regions which are not defined exclusive to region A can be placed or overlapped with region A.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-gap <float>\fR" Specifies the value of the gap, in microns, that is maintained among exclusive groups.  Default: 5 (microns)  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB<group_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the created group.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createExclusiveGroups parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man createExclusiveGroups  "\fB-min_gap <float>\fR" Specifies the value of the minimum gap, in microns, that is maintained among exclusive groups.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-mutuallyExclusiveGroups <string>\fR" Specifies the groups which need to be excluded with each other.  You can independently use this option to specify and create multiple mutually exclusive groups.   Note: If a group has already been defined as an exclusive groups, then a second setting for this group using the createExclusiveGroups command will give display an error that suggests you to reset the exclusive groups attributes to default value. If you want to create mutually exclusive groups, then reset the exclusive groups attributes using the deleteExclusiveGroups command and then create the mutually exclusive groups using the createExclusiveGroups -mutuallyExclusiveGroups command.  Data_type: string, optional
