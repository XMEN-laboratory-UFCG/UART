.SH Name \fBman\fR \-  This command is a Tcl wrapper that calls the Linux 'man' command, so you can see man pages for Innovus commands, Innovus Tcl global variable, or other Linux commands
.SH Syntax \fBman\fR  <command_name> | <msg_id>
.P This command is a Tcl wrapper that calls the Linux 'man' command, so you can see man pages for Innovus commands, Innovus Tcl global variable, or other Linux commands. The man-page directories inside the Innovus installation are automatically added to the beginning of the Linux environment variable MANPATH so you will see Innovus man-pages before any other man-pages in your MANPATH.
.P The only exception is if the argument matches the msg_id format (e.g. several letters with a dash followed by an integer like 'ABC-123')., the Tcl wrapper directly returns the msg_id message you would see in the log file, along with any extended help description if it is available for that msg_id. These msg_id 'man-pages' are not included in the man-page directories, but are only available inside Innovus.
.P For all other arguments, it just calls the Linux 'man' command with the proper MANPATH, so you can use any Linux 'man' options as described in the Linux man-page for 'man'.
.P For information on setting up MANPATH for Stylus Common UI commands directly from Linux, see Setting Up the Run-Time Environment in the Getting Started chapter of the Innovus User Guide. 
.SH Parameter    "\fB<command_name>\fR" Indicates the name of the text command (or variable) for which the manual information is required.  "\fB<msg_id>\fR" Specifies a message ID in the format like 'ABC-123'. The output will show the log file message and any extended help description that can include likely causes, possible fixes, and possible workarounds for this msg_id.
