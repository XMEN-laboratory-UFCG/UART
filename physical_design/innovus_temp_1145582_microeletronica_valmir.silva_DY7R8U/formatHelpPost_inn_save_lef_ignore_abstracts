.P Specifies whether to remember a list of unused LEF block macros (CLASS BLOCK or RING) so they are not read back with restoreDesign.  If you have a large number of LEF blocks (for example, memories) that are not used in this design, this can speedup restoreDesign and reduce memory by skipping those LEF cells. Small blocks with less then 10 pins are still read in, because they are sometimes added later in the flow.
