.TH reportRC  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreportRC\fR \-  Calculates the first and second RC values
.SH Syntax \fBreportRC\fR  [-help]  <fileName>  [-inst <string>]  [-layer <string>]  [-max_second_rc <float>]
.P Calculates the first and second RC values. The first RC value is the longest continuous vertical rx cut for a cell, where:
.RS  "*" 2 Rx cut is always in the left or right boundaries of the cell, and at times in the internal cell.  "*" 2 It is the longest vertical bar (number of rows) in which the cell's rx cut participate in.  "*" 2 Multiple-height cells contribute the rows of height.
.RE
.P The second RC value is the largest distance (in microns) from the left or right boundary of the cell to the second rx cut in the left and right directions.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB -help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each reportRC parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man reportRC  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the report filename.  Note: The report filename must be specified. Else, the software will display error message IMPTCM-46.  "\fB-inst <string>\fR" Specifies the distance from inst to report.   "\fB-layer <string>\fR" Specifies the layer of obs to calculate.   "\fB-max_second_rc <float>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance to calculate the second RC.  Default: 2 
.SH Examples
.P Refer to the following examples:
.P Example 1: STD Cell 1
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P Example 2: STD Cell 2
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P Example 3: Special Cells (Multi-height)
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P Example 4: Special Cells (ENDCAP)
.P Note that:
.RS  "*" 2 An ENDCAP cell has a single RC.  "*" 2 The cell with ENDCAP must have a long second RC.  "*" 2 The second RC effect is saturated at 2um. It means that the second RC value for the cell is 2 um.
