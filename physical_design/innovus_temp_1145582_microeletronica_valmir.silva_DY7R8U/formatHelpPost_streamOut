.P Creates a GDSII Stream file of the current database. Writes a summary of errors and warnings to the log file.
.P You can use the streamOut command after the design is placed, but is most commonly used only after the design is routed (which may also include metal fill shapes).
.RS  "*" 2 If you do not specify a map file, the Innovus software creates a generic map file, in GDSII Version 3 format. The generic file shows the mapping that was used, if none was specified. You must customize the file to make it appropriate for your design. You can change the version by using the setStreamOutMode -version parameter.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 You must specify all layers to stream out. Layers that are not specified in the map file are not included in the file created by this command.  Note: A cut layer in the map file (for a via) can have both MASK and SIZE at the same time.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If you specify the -merge parameter and you want to merge files with a version number greater than 3, the software generates a file with the highest version number from the merged files.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If you do not specify -outputMacros, LEFPIN and LEFOBS do not apply. If you do specify -outputMacros and LEFPIN and LEFOBS are not specified in the map file for the layers in the LEF macros, the GDSII structures for those macros will be empty.   "*" 2 If MAXVOLTAGE and MINVOLTAGE constructs are there in the layermap, streamOut will output a max voltage label and a min voltage label, for each net, to the GDSII file.
.RE
.P Note: Pin label is attached to physical pin shapes. If physical pin shapes do not exist, the pin text is labeled on any one instance pin shape. If both physical pin and instance pin shapes do not exist on the net, no pin text is generated in the output. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-attachInstanceName <attributeNumber>\fR" Specifies the instance name value added to the attribute on SREF of the specified attribute number. The attribute number is an integer and its range is 1-127.  "\fB-attachNetName <attributeNumber>\fR" Specifies that the net name will be added to the specified attribute number on the regular and special net wire shapes and vias SREF, but not on PIN shapes and pin vias. The attribute number is an integer and its range is 1-127.  "\fB-attachNetProp {{<prop_name1> <attr_num1>} {<prop_name2> <attr_num2>........}}\fR" Specifies the attribute number on wiring shapes that will be used to store the value of the property associated nets in the design. For this option, you specify a list of property name and its attribute number.  Note: Multiple property names can be specified. Only wiring shapes associated with nets that contain one or more of the specified property names will have values assigned to their attributes.  Example:  -attachPropName { {prop1 100} {prop2 101} }  In the above example, the attribute number 100 will be used to store the value of the property prop1, and the attribute number 101 will be used to store the value of the property prop2. It is a list of lists with a pair of property and its attribute number.  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Defines the area of the design to be output. Any shapes or instances enclosed, intersecting, or touching the specified area are output. So the data that is output can extend outside the specified area. By default the entire design is output.  "\fB<gdsFileName>\fR" Specifies the GDSII Stream output file. Include the
.gz extension to enable file compression (for example, GDS_file.gds.gz).  "\fB-dieAreaAsBoundary\fR" Forces the streamOut command to write the die area as a polygon (that is, a boundary). Otherwise, the streamOut command writes the die area as a rectangle (that is, a box).  "\fB-enclosed_instances_only\fR" Specifies to stream out only those instances in which the shapes are fully enclosed by the specified area.   "\fB-format {stream oasis}\fR" Specifies the tape out file format.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each streamOut parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man streamOut.  "\fB-ignoreSubtype {NETTYPE SHAPE}\fR" Ignores the map file line containing the subtype keyword , and warning message is printed in the log file.  For example, in the example below, with -ignoreSubtype {NETTYPE SHAPE} the line 61, 62, and 63 of the map file will be ignored.
.RS  "*" 2 Line61: M2 SPNET:NETYPE:POWER:MASK:2   32 12  "*" 2 Line62: M2 SPNET:SHAPE:STRIPE:MASK:2   32 22  "*" 2 Line63: M2 SPNET: NETYPE:GROUND:SHAPE:STRIPE:MASK:2   32 32  "*" 2 Line64: M2 SPNET:MASK:2   32 2
.RE   "\fB-libName <libraryName>\fR" Specifies the library to convert to GDSII Stream format.   Default: DesignLib  "\fB-mapFile <mapFile>\fR" Specifies the file used for layer mapping. This file is required for successful stream out, and is read by the next tool used in the design flow. (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) If you do not specify a file with this parameter, the Innovus software will read a streamOut.map file if one exists. If a  streamOut.mapfile does not exist, the software creates a generic map file that you must customize for your design.   For information on the map file format, see "GDSII or OASIS Map File Format" in the Importing and Exporting Designs chapter of the Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-merge {<listOfExternalGDSOASISFiles>}\fR" Specifies a single file or list of files to merge. Checks all merged files for name collisions, and generates a warning if any names are changed. Uses the following conventions for new names:
.RS  "*" 2 Replaces dot separators (.) with underscores (_). For example, test.test_gds.gds is renamed test_test_gds_gds.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Adds unique identifiers. For example, if more than one cell is named test.test.gds.gds, they are renamed test_test_gds_gds_1, test_test_gds_gds_2, and so on.
.RE   Supports the mixed format of the GDSII and OASIS files. You need to specify the merged files with mixed format using the -merge option. The tool will identify the files format, covert them, and merge them to a stream out file.  Compressed files are acceptable (include the
.gz extension to enable file compression). The Innovus software automatically creates blackboxes when merging and writing macro files. It ignores any cells in the merge files that are not used in the design.  If you specify more than one file, separate the file names with spaces and enclose the list of file names in braces ({}) or double quotation marks (")  You can use a wildcard to read all
.gds files in a specified directory. The usage is as follows:  streamOut -merge <GDSIIdir>/*.gds  where <GDSIIdir> is the name of the directory that contains the
.gds files. 
.P Use caution when using wildcards, as they might affect the order in which the software reads merge files.   "\fB-mergeViaCellMapFile <cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of cells that need merge via cell from an external file.   "\fB-mode {ALL | FILLONLY | NOFILL | NOINSTANCES}\fR" Identifies the layers to write.  Specify one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 ALL--Writes all layer information specified in mapFile as follows: 
.RS  "*" 2 All instances  "*" 2 All via instances  "*" 2 All generated via cells
.RE  "*" 2 FILLONLY--Writes only fill layers specified in mapFile as follows: 
.RS  "*" 2 No instances  "*" 2 Only fill via instances  "*" 2 Only generated fill via cells
.RE  "*" 2 NOFILL--Writes only non-fill layers specified in mapFile.  "*" 2 NOINSTANCES--Writes wiring (including vias) only; does not write out COMPONENT instances.
.RE   "\fB-noStructureName\fR" Enables you merge to files without loading an Innovus database when the -merge parameter is also specified.   "\fB-noTSV <tsv_name_list>\fR" Specifies a list of TSV via names that should not be written out.   "\fB-offset <x> <y>\fR" Specifies, in microns, the location of the design in the GDSII output file. When the GDSII output file is saved, the design shifts to the specified location.  "\fB-outputCriticalNetColorFromFileOnly <sideFile>\fR" Specifies the net list and the layer range through a side-file. The streamOut command outputs the object color on the specified layers and nets, Other objects remain gray in GDS.
.P Here is an example of a side file:  <LAYERMAP>  M5             PIN:MASK:1,NET:MASK:1,SPNET:MASK:1,VIA:MASK:1        35           271  M5             PIN:MASK:2,NET:MASK:2,SPNET:MASK:2,VIA:MASK:2        35           272  M6             PIN:MASK:1,NET:MASK:1,SPNET:MASK:1,VIA:MASK:1        36           271  M6             PIN:MASK:2,NET:MASK:2,SPNET:MASK:2,VIA:MASK:2        36           272  </LAYERMAP>  <NETNAMELIST>  TOP/NET1  TOP/NET2 
...  </NETNAMELIST>   "\fB-outputInstanceName <instName>\fR" Writes the instance name to the oasis file.   "\fB-outputMacros\fR" Writes LEF abstract information such as LEF pin geometries and obstructions for macros. Writes one text label per port within a LEF macro pin plus one text label per shape for feedthrough pins only if setStreamOutMode -labelAllPinShape is not set to true.  Specify this parameter to create GDSII output that contains the LEF macro structures as well as the design data. You can also use this parameter to debug LEF macro definitions against verification DRC rules. The output contains macro pins and obstructions.  Note: LEFPIN and LEFOBS apply only when you specify this parameter. If you specify this parameter and LEFPIN and LEFOBS are not specified in the map file for the layers in the LEF macros the GDSII structures for those macros will be empty.  "\fB-outputNetName <netName>\fR" Writes the net name to the oasis file.   "\fB-pvs_fill\fR" Merges the PVS fill data attached to the current DB into the output GDS file and instantiates the PVS top fill cell at 0,0 R0 inside the top design cell. The PVS fill format must be GDS.    "\fB-reportFile file_name\fR" Outputs cell name changed to the file.  "\fB-strict\fR" Truncates the object outside the area.   "\fB-structureName <structureName>\fR"  "\fB<><><>\fR" Specifies the superstructure that consists of all geometries that the map file writes out.  Default: Current design's top cell name  "\fB-uniquifyCellNames\fR" Creates unique cell names if there are name collisions when the software merges files.  Creates unique cell names if there are name collisions when the Innovus software merges files.   Note: You must specify the -merge parameter if you specify this parameter. When you list the merge files, list the top-level file first, as the software uses the first name in the search path when renaming cells.    When a cell name is repeated, the software renames the cell <cellName_filename>, where <filename> is the name of the merge file in which the cell name appears.  The software changes the name of references to that cell in the merge file. The software changes the reference name if the referenced cell is defined in the same file, regardless of whether the cell is defined before or after the reference. If a reference in a merge file refers to a cell definition in a different merge file, then the reference is not changed in the GDSII Stream output file.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the software ignores duplicate cell names.  "\fB-units {100 | 200 | 1000 | 2000 | 10000 | 20000}\fR" Specifies the resolution for values in the GDSII file. Choose 100, 200, 1000, 2000, 10000, or 20000.  Default: Units specified in LEF file 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a GDSII Stream file (merging cells from the ios.gds file):   streamOut amba_usb.gds -mapFile streamOut.map -libName DesignLib     -attachInstanceName 12 -merge {ios.gds}     -attachNetName 15    -units 2000 -mode ALL    -dieAreaAsBoundary 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates blackboxes for cells not found in the merge libraries and writes macros only for those cells:   streamOut newFile.gds.gz -merge {myFile1 myFile2 myFile3} -outputMacros
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command merges cells needed in the design from all files in myDirectory with the current database:   streamOut myFile.gds.gz -merge myDirectory/*.gds  If a merge file contains cells such as A, B, C, D, X, Y, and Z, and the design contains only cells A, B, and D, then the Innovus software merges only cells A, B, and D.  "*" 2  The following example shows a stream out map file. The first column specifies the layer object name, and the second column specifies the layer object type. The third and fourth columns specify the GDS layer and data type to stream those objects, respectively. When the object name is "NAME", it indicates the text label for the object types specified in the second column.  ==========original streamout.map file=============  M1        NET          1        0  M1        SPNET        2        0  M1        PIN          3        0  M1        LEFPIN       4        0  M1        FILL         5        0  M1        VIA          6        0  M1        VIAFILL      7        0  M1        LEFOBS       8        0  NAME      M1/NET       1        0 <--- text for nets  NAME      M1/SPNET     2        0 <--- text for special nets (i.e. power nets)  NAME      M1/PIN       3        0 <--- text for pins including top level IO pins  NAME      M1/LEFPIN    4        0 <--- text for LEF pins  ===================================================
