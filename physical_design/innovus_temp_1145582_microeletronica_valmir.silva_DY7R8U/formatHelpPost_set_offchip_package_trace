.SH Name \fBset_offchip_package_trace\fR \-  Specifies to include RDL0 (off-chip package trace) resistance effects during the static and dynamic rail analysis
.SH Syntax \fBset_offchip_package_trace\fR  [-help]   -mapping <mapping_file>  -name <switched_name>  -ploc_file_list <list_of_bump_location_files>  [-reset]  -spice <spice_model_name>  [-subckt <subcircuitname>] 
.P Specifies to include RDL0 (off-chip package trace) resistance effects during the static and dynamic rail analysis. This flow allows you to analyze switched net bumps that are marked as RDL0 bumps. When this command is specified, the software automatically generates switched net bump current and bump voltage waveforms in the voltus_rail_pad.tran.ptiavg file created in the new switch net directory located under the rail state directory.
.P You can specify multiple set_offchip_package_trace commands to define connectivity of different bump nets.   
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each set_offchip_package_trace parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man set_offchip_package_trace.  "\fB-mapping <mapping_file>\fR" Specifies the name of the mapping file that contains the mapping between the package port and switched net bump names. The format of the file is:  <spice_circuit_port_name> pin <vsrcName_in_switch_net's_ploc>   "\fB-name <trace_model_name>\fR" Specifies the trace model name or switched net bump of RDL0.   "\fB-ploc_file_list <list_of_bump_location_files>\fR" Specifies the name of a file containing switched net names and associated ploc/power pad files. The format of the file is:  SWITCHED_NET1 plocfile1  SWITCHED_NET2 plocfile2 
.....  The format of plocfile (power pad) is:  <voltage_source_name> <x> <y> <metal_layer>  The format of this file is same as specified for the set_power_pads -format xy format.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all the previous set_offchip_package_trace command settings to the default settings.  "\fB-spice<model_file>\fR" Specifies a file containing a SPICE subcircuit (RDL0 netlist or full-chip package netlist) for off-chip package trace.  "\fB-subckt <subcircuitname>\fR" Defines the top-level subcircuit for off-chip package tracing.
