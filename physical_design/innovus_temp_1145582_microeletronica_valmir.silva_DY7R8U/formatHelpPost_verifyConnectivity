.P Detects conditions such as opens, unconnected wires (geometric antennas), unconnected pins, loops, partial routing, and unrouted nets; generates violation markers in the design window; reports violations. Running this command does not impact database unless you save the design, which also saves the violation markers.
.P The Verify Connectivity feature can use setMultiCpuUsage and other multi-CPU commands for multi-threading.
.P For more information, see the Multiple-CPU Processing Commands chapter in the Innovus  Text Command Reference document.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information of each verifyConnectivity parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man verifyConnectivity  "\fB-allPGPinPort\fR" Verifies all PG ports connection.   "\fB-append\fR" Displays incremental results in the Violation Browser. By default, violation markers are over-written with new results during each verifyConnectivity run. When you specify this parameter, violation markers are appended to the violations of the previous verifyConnectivity run.  "\fB-connLoop\fR" Checks for connectivity loops in regular wires.  Detects connectivity loops based on the end points of the center line of a regular wire segment or the center of a via.  "\fB-dividePowerNet\fR" Divides power nets into four subareas for connectivity verification. Use this parameter to decrease memory usage in 32-bit machines with limited memory. This parameter might increase or decrease the run time, depending on the design.  "\fB-error <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of errors to report. The command stops when the maximum value is reached.   Default: 1000  "\fB-ignorePGPin <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the cell containing the PG pin that can be ignored during connectivity check.   "\fB-markerOnHighestLayer\fR" Reports the opening on the highest layer of the pin, which has more one shape.   "\fB-geomConnect\fR" Checks for connectivity violations of regular wires. Uses a geometrical model instead of the center-line model. In other words, if the wires overlap at any point, they are considered to be connected--they do not have to connect at the center line.  Use this parameter if you manually change the routing or use a third-party router that does not route using the centerline connection routing technique.  "\fB-geomLoop\fR" Checks for loop violations of regular nets using a geometrical model. The nets do not have to overlap on the center line. When you specify this parameter, the Innovus software does not perform any other connectivity checks.  Use this parameter if you use a third-party router that does not route using the centerline connection routing technique. In this case, the -connLoop parameter might not detect connectivity loop violations.  "\fB-net <netNames>\fR" Specifies that connectivity should be verified for specified nets only. If you specify more than one net, separate the net names with space and surround the list of net names with braces or quotes. You can use wildcards (* and ?) when you specify net names.  Note: The -net and -selected parameters are mutually exclusive.  Default: If you do not specify either the -net or the -selected parameter, verifyConnectivity verifies all nets.  "\fB-noAntenna\fR" Ignores violations due to unconnected wires (also called geometrical antennas or dangling wires). A wire is called an antenna when the wire end to via edge distance is more than  of the wire width as shown in the picture below:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   In this picture, the blue rectangle is the wire and the yellow squares are the vias.  "\fB-noFill \fR" Ignores the metal fill.   "\fB-noFloatingMetal\fR" Ignores floating metals. A wire is called floating methal, when both ends of the wire are not connected to pin shapes as shown in the picture below.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   In this picture, the blue rectangle is the wire and the green squares are pin shapes.  "\fB-noOpen\fR" Ignores open violations. A wire is said to be open when one of its ends is connected to a pin shape but the other end is not connected to any pin as shown in the picture below.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   In this picture, the blue rectangle is the wire and the green squares are pin shapes.  Note: This parameter automatically turns on the -noUnConnPin parameter, because open and unconnected pin verification are performed together. A pin shape that is not connected to any wire is called an unconnected pin (unConnPin).  "\fB-noUnConnPin\fR" Ignores violations due to pins that are not connected to any other objects. In the picture below, the pin on the right is an unconnected pin (unConnPin) as it is not connected to any wire.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note: This parameter is specified automatically when you specify the -noOpen parameter.  "\fB-noUnroutedNet\fR" Ignores nets that are not routed.  "\fB-noWeakConnect\fR" Disables checking for routing to more than one port of the weakly connected pin ports.  "\fB-noSoftPGConnect\fR" Disables checking of soft Power/Ground connects. By default, verifyConnectivity checks the connectivity on masterslice layers. If -noSoftPGConnect option is specified, connectivity on these layers is ignored.  "\fB-preferredTopLayer <integer>\fR" Specifies the preferred top metal layer. When this parameter is used, verifyConnectivity does not check the specified top layer and above layers.  "\fB-rawViolsMark\fR" Displays violation markers for opens as the bounding box of the island. By default, violation markers for opens are displayed as polygons that include all wires, pins, and vias that connect to the island.  "\fB-removeOldOpenVio\fR" Removes old open violations.   "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the report file for connectivity violation data.  "\fB-selected\fR" Specifies that connectivity should be checked for selected nets or the nets connected to the pins of selected instances/macros.  Note: The -net and -selected parameters are mutually exclusive.  Default: If you do not specify either the -net or the -selected parameter, verifyConnectivity verifies all nets in the design.  "\fB-tsv <abstractdiefilenames>\fR" Specifies the TSV abstract die files to be used to check the uBumps between the current die and the adjacent dies. Here, <abstractdiefilenames> specifies the names of abstract die files created using the command writeDieAbstract.  "\fB-type {all | regular | special}\fR" Specifies the type of wires to verify. verifyConnectivity is only concerned with the type of the wire and via (special or regular), but not the type of the pin. Irrespective of the type specified, all unconnected terminals (special and regular) are always reported unless -noUnConnPin is on.   Default: all  Note: To check connectivity for whole nets, you do not need to specify the type.  Note: A pin-open violation is listed under VC DRC type "Problem(s) (ENCVFC-92): Pieces of the net are not connected together". Such a violation means the isolated open island only includes some pins' shapes that come from at least two different ports or pins.  Choose one of the following:  all: Checks all wires, including those that have been previously verified.  regular: Reports all unconnected pins and open islands that do not include any special wire and via. Does not check a net with no regular objects (wire, via, pin).  special: Reports all unconnected pins and open islands that do not include any regular wire and via. Does not report isolated open islands that have any regular wire and via.  "\fB-useNewOpenVio\fR" Uses an open violation marker to show unconnected objects.   "\fB-useVirtualConnection\fR" Implies a virtual connection for all bumps and external I/O pins of the same net. Set this parameter to override default behavior of verifyConnectivity, in which bumps and external I/O pins of the same net are not considered to be interconnected. It is useful in flip chip designs, where the power bumps are connected outside the chip.  "\fB-warning <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of warnings to report.  Default: 50  Range:  [0, 1000000]  Type: Integer
