.SH Syntax \fBmovePowerSwitch\fR  [-help]  [-area {x1 y1 x2 y2}]  [-columnx <string>]  [-fixOverlap]   [-honorSoftBlockage]  [-powerDomain <string>]   [-reportFile <string>]  [-selected]   [-switchInstances <string>]  [-xOffset <float>]   [-yOffset <float>]
.P The command is used to move power switch instances by offset value in X or Y direction. You can specify multiple power switch instances to be moved in the same offset value. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each movePowerSwitch parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man movePowerSwitch  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies moving the switches inside the indicated area.  "\fB-columnx <string>\fR" Specifies moving columns at the indicated x locations.  "\fB-fixOverlap\fR" Internally checks any overlap and fixes it with the suggested offset value.   "\fB-honorSoftBlockage\fR" When used, prevents the movePowerSwitch command from moving power switch cells in areas having soft placement blockage.  "\fB-powerDomain <string>\fR" Specifies moving the switches found in the indicated power domain.  "\fB-reportFile <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the report file that stores information about the moved switches.  "\fB-selected\fR" Specifies moving the selected switches.  "\fB-switchInstances <string>\fR" Specifies moving the switches in the list.   "\fB-xOffset <float>\fR" Specifies moving switches by the indicated amount in the x direction.   "\fB-yOffset <float>\fR" Specifies moving switches by the indicated amount in the y direction.
