.TH get_ccopt_clock_tree_slew  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_clock_tree_slew\fR \-  This command returns the slew information for the user-specified pin
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_clock_tree_slew\fR    [-help]    pin    [-delay_corner <corner>]    [-delay_type {early | late}]    [-edge {rise | fall | both}] 
.P This command returns the slew information for the user-specified pin. The command is usually used to collect slew data on a clock tree, for example, to create custom histograms. 
.P Note: A clock tree specification is required before running get_ccopt_clock_tree_slew. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_ccopt_clock_tree_slew parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man get_ccopt_clock_tree_slew.  "\fB-delay_corner <corner>  \fR" Specifies the delay corner of the specified pin to be queried for slew information. By default, if delay corner is not specified, CCOpt uses the CTS primary corner as configured by the set_ccopt_property primary_delay_corner <corner>command. If this is not set, it will use the default setup analysis view as configured by the set_default_view -setup <view>command.  "\fB-delay_type {early | late}] \fR" Specifies whether to use early or late half delays.  When early is specified, CCOpt uses only early path timing data to calculate slew, for the clock edge specified. When late is specified, CCOpt uses only late path timing data to calculate slew, for the clock edge specified.  By default, if neither early or late are specified, CCOpt will use late half delays to calculate slew information.  "\fB-edge { rise | fall | both } \fR" Specifies the edge of the specified pin for which slew information is to be calculated.  When fall is specified, CCOpt uses only falling clock edge timing data to calculate slew. When rise is specified, CCOpt uses only rising clock edge timing data to calculate slew. By default, if neither rise or fall are specified, CCOpt uses both rising and falling clock edge timing data to calculate slew.  "\fB<pin>\fR" Specifies the pin for which the slew information is provided. This is a required parameter. 
.SH Examples 
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following command to get a list of clock tree cells:  get_ccopt_clock_tree_cells *  PLLCLK_INST TEST_CONTROL_INST/CPF_LS_101_clk TEST_CONTROL_INST/g145 TEST_CONTROL_INST/g144 TEST_CONTROL_INST/g136...   "*" 2  Use the following command to get the list of pins in the specified clock tree:  get_pins TEST_CONTROL_INST/g145/*  TEST_CONTROL_INST/g145/ZN TEST_CONTROL_INST/g145/A2 TEST_CONTROL_INST/g145/A1  0x5d5  "*" 2  Use the following command to get the slew value for the specified pin:    get_ccopt_clock_tree_slew Inst1/A   The software returns the following value for the slew for the pin A:    0.2228   Note: To confirm that the instance is part of the clock network, use get_ccopt_clock_tree_cells <<inst>>
