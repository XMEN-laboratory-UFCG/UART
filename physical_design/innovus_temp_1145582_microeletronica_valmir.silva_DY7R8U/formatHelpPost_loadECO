.SH Name \fBloadECO\fR \-  Reads a file containing ECO directives and applies the changes to the current netlist
.SH Syntax \fBloadECO\fR  [-help]  [-postMask | -useGACells <GACoreSiteName>]  [-suffix <suffix>]  [-verbose]  <fileName
...> 
.P Reads a file containing ECO directives and applies the changes to the current netlist.
.P You can use this command at any time after you import the design.
.P This command also performs consistency checks while the ECO commands are applied and after the changes are complete. It also checks for and observes power domains. This command produces results compatible with ecoDefIn, so you will use ecoPlace and ecoRoute to complete the ECO process.
.P The ECO directives do not affect routing, except in the following cases:
.RS  "*" 2 DELETENET deletes routing attached to a specified deleted net.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 DELETEINST deletes an instance but leaves the wires attached to the instance dangling. You can then repair dangling wires with the router after ECO is complete.
.RE
.P If you want to reroute the entire design, delete routing before running the loadECO command.
.P This command supports ECOs for gate array designs through the -useGACells and -postMask parameters.
.P If an error occurs when the loadECO command reads the ECO file, the loadECO command stops without reading more commands from the file, and writes error messages to the innovus.log file.
.P Note: The first line of the ECO file you read must be the following:
.P FORMATVERSION 2
.P For information on the commands you can include in the ECO command file, see "ECO Directives," in the Innovus User Guide. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each loadECO.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man loadECO  "\fB<fileName>  \fR" Specifies the name of the file that contains the ECO directives. You can specify more than one file. File names must be separated by one space.  "\fB-suffix  \fR" Specifies the suffix this command adds to spare cells created by deleting instances. The default suffix is SPARE.  "\fB-useGACells <GACoreSite>\fR" Uses gate array cells when adding or deleting instances. This parameter applies to gate array designs only. If ADDINST is specified in the ECO file, the default behavior for ADDINST applies. If DELETEINST is included in the ECO file, the software deletes an instance if the instance master uses the same site as the specified <GACoreSite>, which can be the name of any gate array site defined in the LEF file. If you do not specify this parameter, DELETEINST removes the instance from the netlist.  "\fB-postMask  \fR" When adding an instance, the new cell will be unplaced. The unplaced cell will map to the spare cell during placement with the ecoPlace -useSpareCells command.  When the software deletes an instance, it renames the instance to an instance name at the original level of hierarchy, and appends the specified suffix. If you do not specify the -suffix parameter, this parameter appends SPARE.  "\fB-verbose\fR" Provides a report for nets without drivers and the instance input pins with no net connections.
