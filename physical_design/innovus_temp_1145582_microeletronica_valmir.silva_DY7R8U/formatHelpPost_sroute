.P Routes power structures. Use this command after creating power rings and power stripes. Depending on the parameters you use, it can do any or all of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 Create pad rings  "*" 2 Connect pins on specified nets on the blocks  "*" 2 Connect pads to nearby rings or stripes  "*" 2 Extend unconnected stripes to make a connection  "*" 2 Route standard cell pins
.RE
.P Note: To undo the sroute command, use the defOut command to save the design database before you issue the sroute command. Then you can use the defIn command to restore the design to its state before running sroute. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each sroute parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man sroute  "\fB-allowJogging {0 | 1)\fR" Specifies that jogs are allowed during routing to avoid DRC violations.  Note: You can use -allowJogging 1 and -connect padRing together to enable jog connection in pad ring connection.  "\fB-allowLayerChange {0 | 1}\fR" Allows connections to targets on different layers.  Default:  Note: This parameter replaces the -noLayerChangeRoute parameters.  If the 1 preferred routing direction is vertical and standard cells have their VDD and VSS pins on layer 1, sroute will change routing layers to continue extending the followpin connections to core rings by this option  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates for the area in which power is to be routed.   Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the entire design is routed.  If you specify this parameter, existing routes are always preserved, even if you also specify the -deleteExistingRoutes parameter.  "\fB-blockPin {useLef all onBoundary leftBoundary rightBoundary topBoundary bottomBoundary abutPins}\fR" Specifies which block pins to connect.  Note: This parameter replaces the -blockPin {useLefConvention | allPins | boundaryPins}, -blockPinBoundaryOnly, and -blockSides parameters.  Use one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 abutPins: Pins are abutted.  "*" 2 all: All pins on all ports are connected, regardless of how pins are specified in the LEF file.  "*" 2 bottomBoundary: Only pins on the bottom boundary are connected.  "*" 2 onBoundary: Connects only pins that abut block boundaries.  "*" 2 topBoundary: Only pins on the top boundary are connected.   "*" 2 useLef: Pins are connected exactly as specified in the LEF file. For example, if the LEF file has multiple ports with one geometry connecting to each port, then one pin per port is connected.
.RE   "\fB-blockPinLayerRange {minLayerName maxLayerName}\fR" Specifies the layers on which the tool can make connections, between the bottom-most and top-most layers. A value of 1 indicates the lowest metal later, 2 indicates the next layer up, and so forth.
.RS  "*" 2 maxLayerName: Specifies the top-most block pin layer to connect to.  "*" 2 minLayerName: Specifies the bottom-most block pin layer to connect to.
.RE   "\fB-blockPinTarget {nearestTarget | boundaryWithPin | farthestPadRing} | {[blockring] [padring] [ring] [stripe] [ringpin] [blockpin]}}\fR" Extends the block pin to targets of specified type. Multiple target types are allowed. The block pin will be open if no specified target is found:
.RS  "*" 2 nearestTarget: Extends the block pin to the nearest legal target.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 boundaryWithPin: Extends the block pin to the design boundary and creates a new power pin along the design boundary. Any overlaps with existing I/O pins at the design boundary are flagged as violations after the extension.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 farthestPadRing : Extends the block pin to the last pad ring that already exists on top of the I/O pad cells.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 blockring padring ring stripe ringpin blockpin
.RE   Note:
.RS  "*" 2 Specify either {nearestTarget}, {boundaryWithPin}, {farthestPadRing}, or a value from the following for which multiple keywords are allowed:  {blockring padring ring stripe ringpin blockpin}  "*" 2 Shielding wire is not regarded as the target of the block pin.
.RE   "\fB-blockPinWidthRange {min max}\fR" Specifies the allowable pin widths, between the maximum and minimum widths given.  Specifies the maximum block pin width to connect to.   Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the software uses a value of 100.  Specifies the minimum block pin width to connect to. The default value is 0.0  "\fB-connect  {[blockPin] [corePin] [padPin] [padRing] [floatingStripe] [secondaryPowerPin] }\fR" Connects the specified objects to rings and stripes.  If -connect is not provided, sroute connects padPin, padRing, corePin, blockPin and floatingStripe by default.  If -connect {} is provided, sroute does nothing and exits.  While connecting to the padRing, the connecting result may appear unexpected if the pads do not abut to the boundary. This is because in such cases, the direction calculation is inaccurate. Creating IO rows in consistency with the pad ring direction can guide the connecting direction.  To connect secondaryPowerPin, you must explicitly use the combination of -connect {secondaryPowerPin} and -secondaryPinNet {netname}.  Note: You can use -allowJogging 1 and -connect padRing together to enable jog connection in pad ring connection.  "\fB-connectAlignedBlockAndPadPin {blockPinAsTarget | padPinAsTarget}\fR" Specifies whether block or pad pins can be connection targets for aligned pad or block pins.  Note: This parameter replaces -blockPinToAlignedPadPin and -padPinToAlignedBlockPin
.RS  "*" 2 blockPinAsTarget: Specifies that a block pin can be considered a connection target for a pad pin if the block pin is aligned with the pad pin.  "*" 2 padPinAsTarget: Specifies that a pad pin can be considered a connection target for a block pin if the pad pin is aligned with the block pin.
.RE   "\fB-connectInsideArea\fR" Specifies that connections from all sources within the specified area can connect only to targets that are also inside that area.  Note: This parameter is only available if you also specify the -area parameter.  Default: If you do not specify this option the software makes connections from all sources within the specified area to targets both inside and outside the specified area.  "\fB-corePinCheckStdcellGeoms\fR" Checks the standard cell geometries in the design for any spacing violations between the power rail to power stripe vias and cell blockages to repair any DRC violations. When detected, Innovus repairs these violations by trimming the via arrays as needed. Use this parameter after routing the power structures.  Default: off  "\fB-corePinLayer {<layerNumList>}\fR" Connects power pins only on the specified layers. A value of 1 indicates the lowest metal later, 2 indicates the next layer up, and so forth. If you specify more than one layer, you must enclose the list in curly braces.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, only pins on 1 or 2 will be connected.  Note: Recommend to use LEF layer name.  "\fB-corePinTarget {{[blockring] [ring] [stripe] [padring] [ringpin] [blockpin]}|{ firstAfterRowEnd | boundaryWithPin | farthestPadRing | none }}\fR" Specifies the extension target for followpins.
.RS  "*" 2 firstAfterRowEnd: Extends the standard cell pin to the first ring or stripe outside of the row.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 boundaryWithPin: Extends the standard cell pin to the design boundary and creates a new power pin along the design boundary. Any overlaps with existing I/O pins at the design boundary are flagged as violations after the extension.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 farthestPadRing: Extends the standard cell pin to the last pad ring that already exists on top of the I/O pad cells.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 none: Unconnected standard cell pins are not extended, and connections may be left open.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 blockring ring stripe padring ringpin blockpin
.RE   Note: Followpin wire can be targets for stripe and secondary pin connection, but not for followpin connection.  Default: firstAfterRowEnd.  "\fB-corePinWidth real\fR" If sroute -corePinWidth is run prior to placement, then the standard cell rails are created with the specified width.  If it is run after the placement, sroute will only route pins that have the specified width.  "\fB-crossoverViaLayerRange {<bot> <top>}\fR" Specifies the highest and lowest layer that can be used for via stacking at the crossover point between power structures.  Note: This parameter does not apply to T-pattern connections.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, all layers are used.  "\fB-deleteExistingRoutes\fR" Specifies that the software remove existing connections when you use the sroute command multiple times.  Default: The software maintains existing connections each time you issue the sroute command.  Note: If you specify the -area parameter, existing routes are always preserved, even if you also specify the -deleteExistingRoutes parameter.  "\fB-detailed_log\fR" Prints the detailed log file.   "\fB-floatingStripeTarget {[blockring] [ring] [stripe] [padring] [ringpin] [blockpin] [followpin]}\fR" Specifies the target shape for floating stripes.  Default: {blockring ring stripe padring ringpin blockpin followpin}  "\fB-inst {<names_of_blocks>}\fR" Specifies the blocks to connect.  Note: This parameter replaces the -blocks parameter.  "\fB-layerChangeRange {bottomLayerName topLayerName}\fR" Allows routing between the specified bottom-most and top-most layer, inclusive.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the tool can use any layer.  Note: This parameter replaces -layerChangeBotLayer and -layerChangeTopLayer.  "\fB-nets {names}\fR" Specifies the names of the nets to connect. If you connect to more than one net, you must enclose the net names in curly braces and separate the names with a space. This parameter supports wildcard characters (like * and ?), when the setSrouteMode -signalPinAsPG parameter is set to true.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the software connects all power and ground nets in the design.  "\fB-noBlockPinOneAmongOverlappedPins\fR" Specifies that all pins (including those that overlap) should be routed.  Note: This parameter is effective only if sroute -blockPin allPins is specified.  Default: If you omit this parameter, if multiple pins overlap either fully or partially, only one will be routed.  "\fB-padCellSkipRoutingOnPadSide {top bottom left right}\fR" Specifies the pad pins of the pads should not be connected.
.RS  "*" 2 bottom: Specifies the pad pins on the bottom side of the pads should not be connected..  "*" 2 left: Specifies the pad pins on the left side of the pads should not be connected.  "*" 2 right: Specifies that power pads along the right side of the chip should not be connected.  "*" 2 top: Specifies that power pads along the top side of the chip should not be connected.
.RE   "\fB-padPinLayerRange {<minLayerName maxLayerName>}\fR" Specifies that routing is allowed between the bottom-most and top-most pad pin layers, inclusive.  This parameter replaces -padPinMaxLayer and -padPinMinLayer.
.RS  "*" 2 maxLayerName: Specifies the top-most pad pin layer allowed for connection.  "*" 2 minLayerName: Specifies the bottom-most pad pin layer allowed for connection.

.RS  "*" 2 nearestTarget: Extends the pad pin to the nearest legal target.  "*" 2 blockring ring stripe ringpin blockpin:
.RE   Default: nearestTarget  "\fB-padPinWidth <real>\fR" Routes only pad pins that have the specified width. If no width is specified, the software automatically calculates the width of the pad pins to use. It is usually not necessary to specify a pin width.  "\fB-padRingLayer <layerNumber>\fR" Specifies which routing layer to use. A value of 1 indicates the lowest metal later, 2 indicates the next layer up, and so forth. The default is all layers.  Note: Recommend to use LEF layer name.  "\fB-padRingWidth <real>\fR" Specifies the width of pins to connect with. By default, the software automatically calculates this width.  "\fB-powerDomains [<powerDomainName1 powerDomainName2
...>]\fR" Restricts sroute activity to the specified power domains.  Default: All power domains  Note: The -deleteExistingRoutes parameter will ignore the -powerDomains parameter while removing existing connections. To remove special nets in a power domain, run editDelete manually before sroute.  "\fB-secondaryPinNet {<list_of_nets>}\fR" Connects voltage level shifter pins on the specified nets to the closest segment of the ring around the power domain. This option is available only if a power domain is defined.  Note: This parameter replaces -shifterPinConnection.

.P  Controls the alignment of stacked cross vias between followpin rails and stripes. When a followpin rail passes through a pair of stripes, the power routing software generates stacked vias to connect the followpin rail to the stripe of the same net. The stacked via is created between the stripes and spans from the followpin rail layer to the layer just below the stripe layer. The via between the stripe layer and the layer below is placed at the intersection of the followpin rail and the stripe of the same net. The vias are connected with a wire from the layer just below the stripe layer.  The srouteAlignViaOnStripe configuration file option is enabled when set to true and only when the following conditions are met:
