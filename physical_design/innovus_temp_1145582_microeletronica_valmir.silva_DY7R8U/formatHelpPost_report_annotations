.SH Name \fBreport_annotations\fR \-  Reports the coverage of the annotations on a design
.SH Syntax \fBreport_annotations\fR  [-missing_resistances]   [-missing_capacitances]   [-missing_rc]  [-missing_delays]   [-missing_spf]   [-max_missing <integer>]   [-tcl_list]   [-ignore_floating_nets]   [-ignore_tied_low_high_nets]   [-ignore_tied_low_high_net_arcs]   [-list_annotated]   [-list_non_annotated]  [-view <viewName>]  [> <filename>] 
.P Reports the coverage of the annotations on a design. These annotations include SDF delay arc annotations, SPF annotations, wire resistances, and wire capacitances.
.P Use the -missing_* options to get a detailed report of all delay arcs and wires that are missing annotations. You can use the information in a Tcl program.
.P Note: The report_annotations command reports only the first 1000 nets, which is the default value of the -max_missing option. Set this option to a higher value if needed, for example: report_annotations -max_missing 1000000.    Note: Command report_annotations is obsolete. Use report_annotated_parasitics for RC annotation report and report_annotated_delay for delay arc annotation instead.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB>  <filename>\fR" Writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  The <filename> parameter must be the last argument in the list. The <filename> and -tcl_list parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  Note: To write a compressed report, add the
.gz extension to the file name.  Default: Report is displayed on standard output without being saved.  "\fB-ignore_floating_nets\fR"  "\fB<> <>\fR" Ignores nets without drivers, power, and ground nets.  "\fB-ignore_tied_low_high_net_arcs\fR" Ignores timing arcs of power and ground nets.  "\fB-ignore_tied_low_high_nets\fR" Ignores nets connected to tied_low and tied_high cells.  "\fB-list_annotated\fR" Lists detailed annotation information for the following annotated arcs:
.RS  "*" 2 annotated internal net arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated input port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated output port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated cell arcs
.RE   "\fB-list_non_annotated\fR" Lists the arc information for the non-annotated arcs corresponding to the following types of arcs:
.RS  "*" 2 annotated internal net arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated input port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated output port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated cell arcs
.RE   "\fB-max_missing  <integer>\fR" Limits the number of missing annotations to the number specified.   Default: 1000  "\fB-missing_capacitances\fR" Reports the nets that are missing capacitances.   Default: Only a summary of the coverage is reported.  "\fB-missing_delays\fR" Reports the arcs that are missing SDF annotations.   Default: Only a summary of the coverage is reported.  "\fB-missing_rc\fR" Reports the nets that are missing resistances and capacitances.   Default: Only a summary of the coverage is reported.  "\fB-missing_resistances\fR" Reports the nets that are missing resistances.   Default: Only a summary of the coverage is reported.  "\fB-missing_spf\fR" Reports the nets that are missing SPF data.   Default: Only a summary of the coverage is reported.  "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Produces the report in Tcl list format instead of a tabular format. This is useful for integrating timing with custom Tcl functions, and also for customizing report generation.  The -tcl_list and <filename> parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  See report_net for an example of the -tcl_list output.  "\fB-view  <viewName>\fR" Reports the coverage of annotations for the specified analysis view. You can specify this parameter only when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner timing analysis mode.  Default: Reports against the default analysis view. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reports the nets that are missing capacitances: report_annotations -missing_capacitances   Default: Only a summary of the coverage is reported.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands show the difference between the summary and the -missing_spf reports:

.P report_annotations -missing_spf Report
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RS  "*" 2 If your SDF has only cell arcs, and net delays are included in the cell delays, you can report the status of annotation for cell arcs, internal net arcs, net arcs from primary inputs, and net arcs to primary outputs, and all timing arcs separately as shown below:
