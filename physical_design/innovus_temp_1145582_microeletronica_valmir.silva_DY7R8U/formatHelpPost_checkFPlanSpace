.SH Name \fBcheckFPlanSpace\fR \-  Checks the floorplan for spacing rule violations and saves the violation information in a report
.SH Syntax  \fBcheckFPlanSpace\fR     [-help]    [-outfile <filename>]    [-constraints <filename> | -trackUtil <layerID value layerID value
...>]    [-clearMarker]
.P Checks the floorplan for spacing rule violations and saves the violation information in a report. A marker is displayed at each violation spot. You can use the command at any point in the design flow. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-clearMarker\fR" Clears all space violation markers.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-constraints <filename>\fR" Specifies the file that contains the spacing rules. A constraint file is a text file that can contain a list of seeds to use when generating fences and module guides, and basic relative, spacing and orientation constraints to follow during macro placement.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each checkFPlanSpace parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man checkFPlanSpace  "\fB-outfile <filename>\fR" Writes the spacing rule violation information to the specified file.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-trackUtil <layerID value layerID value
...>  \fR" Specifies the track utilization value on each routing layer from bottom to top, for example, Metal1 value Metal1 value. If the layer track utilization value is not specified, the default value is used.  Note: The checkFPlanSpace command supports the model based space checker. It takes user provided track utilization numbers and technology information stored in the LEF file to estimate required minimum channel width between placed macros. This estimated minimum channel width (demand) is then compared to actual channel width (supply) in floorplan. A violation marker is displayed in GUI over the channel in which the supply is less than the demand.  Data_type: list, optional
