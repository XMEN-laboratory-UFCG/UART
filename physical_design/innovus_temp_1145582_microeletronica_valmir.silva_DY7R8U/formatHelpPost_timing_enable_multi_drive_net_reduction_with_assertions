.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_multi_drive_net_reduction_with_assertions\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_enable_multi_drive_net_reduction_with_assertions\fR  {none | delay | all} 
.P Default: none
.P Allows reduction of multi-drive networks when constraint assertions are present on the network elements:
.P The following options are available:
.P none:  Reduction is not performed on portions of the network where constraints have been asserted.
.P delay: Reduction of the multi-drive network will still be applied if onlyset_annotated_delay and set_annotated_transition constraints have been applied. Other constraints present on the multi-drive network can still prevent full reduction.
.P all: The software ignores the presence of any assertions on the multi-drive network and forces reduction to occur.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
