.SH Name \fBsetSpecialRouteType\fR \-  Sets special routing wires to a particular shape type so that they can be written out into a DEF file using the -specialShape parameter of the defOutBySection command
.SH Syntax \fBsetSpecialRouteType\fR  [-help]   -stopTypeList <swire_type_list>  [-stopLayer <Metal_layer>]   -setType {BLOCKRING|BLOCKAGEWIRE|BLOCKWIRE|COREWIRE|DRCFILL|FILLWIREOPC|FILLWIRE|FOLLOWPIN|IOWIRE|NOTYPE|PADRING|RING|STRIPE}   {-bumpCell<bumpCellList> | -instPin {{<inst1> <pin1>} {<inst2> <pin2>}...}} 
.P Sets special routing wires to a particular shape type so that they can be written out into a DEF file using the -specialShape parameter of the defOutBySection command. This makes data filtering easier by enabling customized selection and output of special routing shape types. The output data is very specific and can be easily managed as storage size is small.
.P The setSpecialRouteType command works by tracing special wires and vias that touch bumps or instance pins through to a stop-layer or special wire stop type. All the traced special wires and vias are marked with a particular wire type. The defOutBySection -specialShape command is then used to write out the special type routes and vias.
.P Note: Use the setSpecialRouteType and defOutBySection commands in sequence. Save the design before you modify the shape types so that you can recover the original design with defIn. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setSpecialRouteType parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man setSpecialRouteType  "\fB-bumpCell <bumpCellList>\fR" Specifies the list of bump cells. If this option specified, the tracing starts from any special wires and vias that touch the named bump cells.  Note: This option cannot be used with -instPin.  "\fB-instPin {{<inst1 pin1>} {<inst2 pin2>}<...>}\fR" Specifies a list of pairs of instances and their pins. If this option specified, the tracing starts from any special wires and vias that touch the named instance pin pairs.  Note: This option cannot be used with -bumpCell.  "\fB-setType {BLOCKRING|BLOCKAGEWIRE|BLOCKWIRE|COREWIRE|DRCFILL|FILLWIREOPC|FILLWIRE|FOLLOWPIN|IOWIRE|NOTYPE|PADRING|RING|STRIPE}\fR" Sets the marked special wire to the specified wire type (DEF SPECIAL ROUTE SHAPE type).  Default: IOWIRE  "\fB-stopLayer <Metal_layer>\fR" Specifies the metal layer at which tracing should stop.  "\fB-stopTypeList <swire_type_list>\fR" Specifies the special-wire types used in tracing. When a special wire with a shape type that is not included in the list is encountered, tracing stops. The legal list of <swire_type_list> are the DEF SPECIAL ROUTE SHAPE types: BLOCKRING, BLOCKAGEWIRE, BLOCKWIRE, COREWIRE, DRCFILL, FILLWIREOPC, FILLWIRE, FOLLOWPIN, IOWIRE, NOTYPE, PADRING, RING, STRIPE. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command traces special wires and vias that touch the named bump cells. Tracing stops when a special wire of type other than IOWIRE is encountered. The marked special wire is set to IOWIRE.   setSpecialRouteType -bumpCell {bc*} -stopTypeList {IOWIRE} -setType IOWIRE
