.SH Name \fBset_disable_timing\fR \-  Disables timing propagation through the specified arcs, or a collection of instance-specific arcs that are created using the get_arcs command
.SH Syntax  \fBset_disable_timing\fR  [-from <pin_name> -to <pin_name>]  <object_list> 
.P Disables timing propagation through the specified arcs, or a collection of instance-specific arcs that are created using the get_arcs command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-from <pin_name>-to <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the arc that is to be disabled. Specify the -from and -to options together.  You can specify the -from and -to parameters when the <object_list> contains instance or library cell objects. Do not specify the -from and -to parameters when the <object_list> includes instance pin or library cell pin objects.  The -from and -to options are optional. If not specified, all cell arcs found in the instance or library cell objects are disabled.  "\fBobject_list\fR" Specifies the instance, instance pin, library cell, library cell pin objects, collection of library arcs, or collection of timing arcs.  If the <object_list> includes instance pin or library cell pin objects, all cell arcs attached to the specified pin objects are disabled.  If the <object_list> contains instance or library cell objects, and the -from and -to parameters are not specified, all arcs found in the specified instance or library cell objects are disabled. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command disables the arcs that lead to the output pins of the i1, i2, and i3 instances. Note that timing checks at the inputs of i1, i2, and i3 are still active. set_disable_timing [get_cells {i1 i2 i3}]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command disables the arc from pin B to pin Z in the i1 and i2 instances, and the arc from pin A to pin Z in the i3 instance: set_disable_timing -from B -to Z [get_cells {i1 i2}]  set_disable_timing -from A -to Z [get_cells {i3}]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example disables timing check arcs from pin CLK to pin D of the ff1 instance: set_disable_timing -from CLK -to D [get_cells ff1]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example disables the outgoing cell arcs from instance input pin i1/B: set_disable_timing [get_pins i1/B]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example disables all arcs found in any instances whose reference cell is AN2: set_disable_timing [get_lib_cells AN2]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example disables a collection of timing arcs:   set arcs [get_lib_arcs -from typical/MX2X1/S0 -to typical/MX2X1/Y]  set_disable_timing [index_collection $arcs 3]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example disables arcs created using filter_collection on library timing arcs:   set arc [filter_collection $arcs {when == "((A)&(!(B)))"}]  set_disable_timing $arc
