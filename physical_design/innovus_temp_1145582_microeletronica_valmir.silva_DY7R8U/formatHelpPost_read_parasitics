.SH Name \fBread_parasitics\fR \-  Reads the SPEF and RCDB-based RC parasitics information and information from the RCDBs already created in Innovus
.SH Syntax \fBread_parasitics\fR   [-help]  [-force]  [-rc_corner_map <rc_corner1:spef_field1 rc_corner2:spef_field2
...>]  [-starN]  {[{{[-rc_corner <string>]}}]}  [-via_variation_file <viaVariationFile>] 
.P Reads the SPEF and RCDB-based RC parasitics information and information from the RCDBs already created in Innovus. For hierarchical designs, use this command to read top-level as well as block-level parasitic information.
.P Note: The following are important aspects to be considered for using this command:
.RS  "*" 2 The RCDB parasitic file must have the
.rcdb.d extension.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The RCDB-based parasitic data that is provided as input to this command must be the one that was saved in the same major release of the software. The command will not read the RCDB data saved in a previous release. For example, if you provide RCDB saved in the software's 10.1.x release as input to the read_parasitics command in the software's 11 release, then it cannot be read.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Only the RCDB parasitic data on systems that are same as those used for saving the data can be read. For example, if the data is saved on Linux in 64-bit mode, you can only restore it on Linux 64-bit mode.
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each read_parasitics parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man read_parasitics.   "\fB-force\fR" Allows reading of parasitic data even when block level RCDB/ SPEF is missing for a corner.  Note: This parameter is only applicable for hierarchical designs. It is required that the top cell should have parasitic data specified for all the active RC corners.  "\fB-rc_corner <list of RCcorner specific RCDBs/SPEFs for hierarchical design>| <RCcorner specific RCDB/SPEF>\fR" Specifies the RC corner name along with a corner-specific RCDB or SPEF for both top and block levels. For hierarchical designs, this parameter lists the corner-specific SPEFs/RCDBs for both top and block levels.  Note: A corner-specific RCDB parasitic file can only be provided as input to the RC corner for which it was generated. It cannot be provided as input to other RC corners.  "\fB-rc_corner_map <rc_corner1:spef_field1 rc_corner2:spef_field2
...>\fR" Provides a mapping of RC corners to the SPEF fields of multi-value SPEF files.   "\fB-starN\fR" Specifies whether or not to read the *N statements in the SPEF file. The *N statements define the location of the RC nodes.  When this parameter is specified, the *N statements are read, otherwise the *N statements are ignored.  "\fB-via_variation_file <viaVariationFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the file for modeling via variation. The contents of the file include all the via layer names with the corresponding MEAN_SHIFT and STDDEV so that all the VIA resistance in SPEF can be mapped to their own variation multiplier. This option is used to specify the via_variation file only when the design has a single corner.  For example,  read_parasitics   -rc_corner rcCornerName \\  -via_variation_file <viaVariationFileName> 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The example below is for hierarchical design with Top (T), Block 1(B1) and Block 2(B2), and two active RC corners, C1 and C2.
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies the RC corner names along with corner-specific RCDB and SPEF for both top and block levels:   read_parasitics \\  -rc_corner C1 Top_C1.spef Block1_C1.spef Block2_C1.spef.gz \\  -rc_corner C2 Top_C2.rcdb.d Block1_C2.spef Block2_C2.rcdb.d
