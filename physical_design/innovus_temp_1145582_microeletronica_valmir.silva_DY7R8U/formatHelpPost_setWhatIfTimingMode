.TH setWhatIfTimingMode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsetWhatIfTimingMode\fR \-  Sets the timing model mode for all blackboxes or blackblobs of the design
.SH Syntax \fBsetWhatIfTimingMode\fR  [-help]   [-reset]   [-context {in | out}]   [-defaultOutputCap <value>]  [-model {intrinsic | normalized}]   [-portPriority {cellType | portParam}]  
.P Sets the timing model mode for all blackboxes or blackblobs of the design. You can select only one mode for all blackboxes or blackblobs. For more information on the timing models, see "What-If Timing Analysis," in the Innovus User Guide.
.P If you modify at least one timing arc, you cannot directly change the mode for the blackboxes or blackblobs. You must first delete the timing arc specifications of the blackboxes or blackblobs using the deleteWhatIfTimingAssertions command.
.P You can use this command after the module definition of the blackbox or the blackblob is available with the I/O's in the Verilog netlist.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-context [{in | out}]\fR" Specifies whether the timing mode description is in-context or out-context. The context refers to the chip-level context.
.RS  "*" 2 In-context: The timing mode description is created once the chip environment is ready, that is, after placement and routing. In this case, the software takes into consideration the capacitance of the design.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Out-context: The timing model is described outside the chip environment and can be described before floorplanning. You provide the value of the timing arc for a given capacitance.
.RE   The value of the -outputCap parameter of the setWhatIfDriveType command is set based on whether the context is in or out.   Note: The -context parameter can be used only in the normalized mode.   The value of the -context parameter is frozen once a timing arc is defined. This is done to avoid having an incorrect timing assertion file later in the flow.  Default: The default value is out.  "\fB-defaultOutputCap [ <value> ]\fR" Specifies the value of the default output capacitance on the port.   Note: The -defaultOutputCap parameter can be used only in the normalized mode.   The value of the -defaultOutputcap parameter is frozen once a timing arc is defined. This is done to avoid having an incorrect timing assertion file later in the flow.  The unit is pico farads.  Default: The default value is 0.  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setWhatIfTimingMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man  setWhatIfTimingMode.  "\fB-model {intrinsic | normalized}\fR" Specifies whether the timing model mode is intrinsic or normalized.  Default: The default mode is normalized.  "\fB-portPriority {cellType | portParam} \fR" On output ports, parameters such as capacitance value, maximum capacitance values, maximum transition value, or the maximum fanout value can come from the driver (setWhatIfDriveType command) or they can be set through the setWhatIfPortParameters command. You can use the -portPriority parameter to specify which of these values take precedence in case of a conflict.
.RS  "*" 2 The value cellType specifies that the parameter values set through the setWhatIfDriveType command take precedence.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The value portParam specifies that the parameter values set through the setWhatIfPortParameters command take precedence.
.RE    Note: The value of the portPriority parameter is frozen  once a what-if timing arc has been defined. This  avoids inconsistencies between he timing  analysis files and the files that you can generate  (such as whatif assertions, timing model, or  SDC) if you change the port priority  subsequently.    Default: The default value is portParam.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setWhatIfTimingMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Note: Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the timing model mode to intrinsic and specifies that in case of a conflict, the parameter values set through the setWhatIfDriveType command takes precedence over the parameter values set through the setWhatIfPortParameters command. Because the -defaultOutputCap parameter and the -context parameter were not specified, the output capacitance is set to 0, and the context is set to out.   setWhatIfTimingMode -model intrinsic -portPriority cellType
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command resets the value of the -model and the -portPriority parameters. Note that the -reset parameter is the first parameter in the command.   setWhatIfTimingMode -reset -model -portPriority
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command resets the value of all the setWhatIfTimingMode parameters   setWhatIfTimingMode -reset
