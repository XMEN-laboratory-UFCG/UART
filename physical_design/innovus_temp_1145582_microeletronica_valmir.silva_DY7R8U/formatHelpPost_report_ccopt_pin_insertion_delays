.SH Name \fBreport_ccopt_pin_insertion_delays\fR \-  Reports pin insertion delays at clock tree sinks
.SH Syntax \fBreport_ccopt_pin_insertion_delays\fR  [-help]  [-bin_size <string>]  [-check_type {setup | hold}]   [-clock_trees {string1 string2
...}]  [-delay_corner <delay_corner_name>]  [-delay_type {early | late}]  [-file <file_name>]    [-skew_groups {string1 string2

.P Reports pin insertion delays at clock tree sinks. By default, the report visits all the clock tree sinks, and checks for pin insertion_delay at each sink. Statistics about the distribution of pin insertion_delay values are generated and reported. The report provides a quick overview of the distribution and nature of the pin insertion delays found, which can be used to identify the  problem areas such as excessively large skews, surprisingly numerous skews, or large numbers of small skews, and so on.
.P The -clock_trees and -skew_groups parameters are used to restrict the scope of the report as a subset of the clock tree sinks, which means that when the -clock_trees parameter is specified, only those sinks that are under the listed clock trees are selected, and when the -skew_groups parameter  is specified, only those sinks that are under the listed skew groups are selected. By default, the report analyzes the pin insertion delays that are found under the CCOpt primary half corner. The -delay_corner, -check_type, and -delay_type parameters permit the selection of another half corner to report against.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_ccopt_pin_insertion_delays parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man report_ccopt_pin_insertion_delays.   "\fB-bin_size <string>\fR" Specifies a bin (bucket) size for the report histograms. By default the software uses the histogram bin size specified using the CCOpt property, pin_insertion_delay_histogram_bin_size.   Use this parameter to override this default bin size value.  For details, see CCOpt Properties in the Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-check_type {setup | hold}\fR" Specifies the check type for the specified skew group to be reported. You can specify either setup or hold.  If a check type is specified, but the -delay_type parameter is not specified, the software behaves in the following manner:
.RS  "*" 2 -check_type -setup will mean -delay_type -late  "*" 2 -check_type -hold will mean -delay_type -early
.RE   Note : If a check type is not specified, the software will always look at what the views permit, preferring the setup view if there is a choice.  "\fB-clock_trees {string1 string2
...}\fR" Restricts the report to the specified clock trees. This means that only those sinks that are under the specified clock trees are selected for reporting.  Default: all defined clock trees  "\fB-delay_corner <delay_corner_name>      \fR" Reports in the specified delay corner.  By default, the software will use the primary-half delay corner that is set using the CCOpt property,  primary_delay_corner
.  "\fB-delay_type {early | late}\fR" Reports in the specified delay type, early or late.  When late is specified, only the late half of the delay corners are reported.  When early is specified, only the early half of the delay corners are reported.  Default: late  "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Specifies that a copy of  the contents of the report be saved to the specified file name.   "\fB-include_reporting_only_skew_groups\fR" When specified, the report additionally includes the reporting-only skew groups. A reporting-only skew group is a skew group whose constrains property is set to none. Such a skew group imposes no clock balancing constraint and will not be considered by CTS.  By default, the reporting-only skew groups are not included in the report. If a reporting-only skew group is explicitly specified using the -skew_groups parameter, then that skew group is always included in the report output.  Note: The -include_reporting_only_skew_groups and -skew_groups parameters are mutually exclusive. If both these parameters are specified together, the software errors out.   "\fB-skew_groups {string1 string2
...}\fR" Restricts the report to the specified skew groups. This means that only those sinks that are under the specified skew groups are selected for reporting.  Note: The -include_reporting_only_skew_groups and -skew_groups parameters are mutually exclusive. If both these parameters are specified together, the software errors out.   Default: all defined skew groups  "\fB-sources {string1 string2
...}\fR" Restricts the report to skew group sink pins that have a pin insertion delay value from one of the listed sources.  This -sources list of categories takes wildcard values that are expanded to matching categories.  For example:  report_ccopt_pin_insertion_delays -sources u*  This is equivalent to:  report_ccopt_pin_insertion_delays -sources {useful_skew user} 
.SH Example
.P The following command reports the pin insertion delays at all clock tree sinks.
.P report_ccopt_pin_insertion_delays
.P Note: The CCOpt pin insertion delays are +ve valued if they produce an advance, and -ve valued if they produce a delay. This can be viewed in the report output shown below.
