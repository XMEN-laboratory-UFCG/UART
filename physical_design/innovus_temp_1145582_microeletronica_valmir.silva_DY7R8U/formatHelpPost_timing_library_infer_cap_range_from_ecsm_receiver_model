.SH Name \fBtiming_library_infer_cap_range_from_ecsm_receiver_model\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_library_infer_cap_range_from_ecsm_receiver_model\fR {true | false}
.P <Default>: false
.P Infers the rise or fall of NLDM pin capacitance range from the ECSM capacitance range while calculating the total loading capacitance during switching power computation. If the global is set to true and the capacitance range is not defined in the library, the rise/fall capacitance range is inferred from the ECSM receiver capacitance models. The capacitance range values are derived either from the pin-level ECSM cap models or the timing-level ECSM cap models.
.P When this global is set to false, the rise/fall capacitance range values are not inferred, and the library values are honored.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
