.SH Name \fBinit_ignore_pgpin_polarity_check\fR
.SH Syntax \fBinit_ignore_pgpin_polarity_check\fR 
.P Type: String
.P Default: NULL
.P Space separated list of leaf cell pin names to ignore polarity checking during globalNetConnect and CPF operations.  Allows USE POWER pin to be connected to a USE GROUND net (or vice versa).
.P When specified, GNC/CPF are allowed to silently make connections to PG pins that are not of the same polarity as the PG net that they are being connected to. The list of pin names is only checked for the case where a polarity check failed and then can be ignored and connected in spite of the polarity mismatch. 
.SH Example
.P set init_ignore_pgpin_polarity_check "bias"
