.TH create_ccopt_clock_tree  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreate_ccopt_clock_tree\fR \-  Defines a new clock tree within the design
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_ccopt_clock_tree\fR  [-help]  [-name <clockname>]  [-no_skew_group]  -source <pin>  [-stop_at_sdc_clock_roots] 
.P Defines a new clock tree within the design. You can define more than one clock tree and ordering of clock tree definitions is important. CCOpt can only optimize defined clock trees. When you run this command, CCOpt runs an algorithm known as clock tree extraction. Clock tree extraction examines the design starting at the root of a clock tree and decides which pins in the circuit are clock sinks for that tree and its clock gating and logical structure.
.P The create_ccopt_clock_tree command tells CCOpt that a part of the circuit is a clock tree. CCOpt then synthesizes the clock tree when you run the ccopt_design command. CCOpt treats clock trees and datapaths differently for power analysis purposes.
.P By default, defining a clock tree also creates associated skew groups. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_ccopt_clock_tree parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man create_ccopt_clock_tree.   "\fB-name <clockname> \fR" Specifies the user-defined identifier for the clock tree. This name should be unique. If this parameter is not specified, the software uses the name of the source pin by default.   "\fB-no_skew_group\fR" Specifies that no default skew group will be defined for the sinks in the clock tree. If any skew groups are required, they will need to be defined manually using the create_ccopt_skew_group command.  "\fB-source <pin>\fR" Specifies the name of the source pin of the clock tree in the design.   "\fB-stop_at_sdc_clock_roots\fR" Specifies that clock tree definition should stop searching for parts of the clock tree through the root of SDC clocks. 
.SH Example
.P The following command creates a clock tree named "ck1" by tracking the clock path from the pin "clk":
.P create_ccopt_clock_tree -name ck1 -source clk
