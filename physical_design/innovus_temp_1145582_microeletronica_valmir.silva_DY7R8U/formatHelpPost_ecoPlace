.SH Name \fBecoPlace\fR \-  Incrementally places the unplaced standard cells
.SH Syntax \fBecoPlace\fR  [-help]   [-fixPlacedInsts {true|false}]  [-place_detail_use_GA_filler_groups {true|false}]   [-reportSpareCells <fileName>]  [-timing_driven {true|false}]  [-useGACells <GACoreSite>]   [-useGAFillerCells <GAFillerCells>]   [-useSpareCells {true|false}]
.P Incrementally places the unplaced standard cells. In a pre-mask flow, this command moves the unplaced standard cells into the core area. During an ECO loop, some new unplaced standard cells may get introduced. If the goal is to move the unplaced standard cells into the core area and place them without disturbing the original placement (pre-mask flow), it is recommended to run ecoPlace at this stage.  In a post-mask flow, if you specify -useSpareCells, the software can map the unplaced cells to the available spare cells. When -useGAFillerCells is provided in a post-mask flow, the command can map existing unplaced cells to placed GAFillers in the design.
.P You can use this command after the ecoDefIn command when some newly added cells are still unplaced. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-fixPlacedInsts {true | false}\fR" Specifies that instances with the PLACED status are not moved.  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ecoPlace parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man ecoPlace.  "\fB-reportSpareCells <fileName>\fR" Specifies to report the spare gates that are selected to map the unplaced instances. This option works with -useSpareCells only.  "\fB-timing_driven {true|false}\fR" Turns on the slack-driven placement for ecoPlace.  Default: false  "\fB-useGACells <GACoreSite>\fR" Selects and places the unplaced instances with techSite matching the provided GACoreSite. It is expected that there is free space to place the instances. If not, GA fillers could be deleted before ecoPlace -useGACells and re-inserted after the command. You can use this parameter only for post-mask ECO.  Note: You cannot specify the -useGAFillerCells parameter if you use this parameter.  "\fB-useGAFillerCells <GAFillerCells>\fR" Specifies a list of Gate Array (GA)-style filler cells that the tool can replace with GA cells during post-mask ECO. You can only use this parameter in a post-mask ECO flow. The new logic instances adding during a post-mask flow must already be present in the netlist.  Note: You cannot specify the -useGACells parameter if you use this parameter.  "\fB-place_detail_use_GA_filler_groups {true|false}\fR" Specifies that filler cell instances will only be replaced by logic instances that belong to the same GA groups.  This option can only be used when there is a filler group created by createGAFillerGroup. ecoPlace -place_detail_use_GA_filler_groups first finds the optimal location for each instance based on its connectivity, then searches for the nearest GA filler cell that is included in the same filler group, places a GA cell at the GA filler location, and deletes the original GA filler.  If the GA cell is smaller than the GA filler, the placer creates a new GA filler instance using the list of GA filler cells in the same filler group and places the filler in the gap.  If there is only one filler group created, it equals to ecoPlace - useGAFillerCells.  Default: false  "\fB-useSpareCells {true | false}\fR" Maps unplaced cells to spare cells during placement. First, checks whether all unplaced cells match spare cells. Next, chooses a spare cell and changes the connections from the unplaced cell to the selected spare cell. Finally, deletes the unplaced cell. You can use this parameter only for post-mask ECO.  This option observes the power domain when selecting the spare cell and maps an unplaced cell to the spare cell in the power domain, based on the instance name of the cell. For example, if module A/B is defined for power domain PD2, this option will map an unplaced cell A/B/inst1 to a spare cell in module A/B.  Default: false 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command performs incremental placement:  ecoPlace -useSpareCells true  "*" 2  The flowing command places the GA-ECO cells on GACORE site.ecoPlace -useGACells GACoreSite   "*" 2  The following command places GA-ECO cells on the specified GA-Fillers and fills remaining gaps with GA-Fillers.  ecoPlace -useGAFillerCells {GAFiller1 GAFiller2
...}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following commands create GA Filler group that associates GA-Function cells with GA-Fillers. Then, ecoPlace will place GA-ECO cells on same group GA-Fillers.  createGAFillerGroup -group GROUP1 -ga_cells {GA_Cell1 GA_Cell2... } -ga_fillers {GA_Filler1 GA_Filler2...}  ecoPlace -place_detail_use_GA_filler_groups true
