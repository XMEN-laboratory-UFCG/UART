.SH Name \fBwrite_macro_place_constraint\fR \-  Enables you to write constraints into a TCL format file from the database
.SH Syntax \fBwrite_macro_place_constraint\fR  [-help]  [-cpg_scope {selected macro_only all}]  -out_file <string>  [-sections {array basic cpg pg_model_over_macros pg_resource_model}] 
.P Enables you to write constraints into a TCL format file from the database. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-cpg_scope {selected macro_only all}\fR" Specifies the instances that are to be written in the CPG guide section.  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each write_macro_place_constraint parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man write_macro_place_constraint  "\fB-out_file <string>  \fR" Specifies the name of the file to which the macro place constraints are written.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-sections {array basic cpg pg_model_over_macros pg_resource_model net_length net_resistance}\fR" Specifies the constraint sections to be written.
.RS  "*" 2 array: Writes macro array constraints.  "*" 2 basic: Writes non-default macro place constraints set by the set_macro_place_constraint command.  "*" 2 cpg: Writes out the guide file for initializing the orientation of the instances and placing them close to the specified location.  "*" 2 pg_model_over_macros: Writes PG modeling for macros.  "*" 2 pg_resource_model: Writes PG resource modeling for standard cell areas.  Note: This option is used to model PG over the whole design if the -pg_model_over_macros option is not specified.
.RE   Note: Only the basic constraints are dumped out if the -sections option is not specified.  Data_type: enum_list, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The  following command writes the basic macro place constraints to the xyz file:  write_macro_place_constraint -cpg_score all -out_file xyz
