.SH Name \fBmap_activity_file\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBmap_activity_file\fR   [-help]  [-golden {rtl | gate}]  [-gate_block <block_name>]  [-reset]  -rtl2gate <mapping_file>  [-rtl_block <block_name>]  [-two_column_mapping_file<mapping_file>] 
.P Specifies instance name mapping between RTL netlist and GATE level netlist. Power analysis uses this instance name mapping to annotate the output nets of this instance from the pin-based RTL VCD or TCF. The mapping file used for instance name mapping is generated by Conformal.
.P You must specify this command before report_power. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-gate_block <block_name>\fR" Specifies the GATE activity block name to map the block-level RTL mapping files to the top-level RTL activity files. The GATE block name is appended before the GATE level entries in the mapping file to match the entries in the top-level RTL activity file.   "\fB-golden {rtl | gate}\fR" Specifies whether RTL or Gate is Golden. The one not specified as golden will be considered as Revised. Currently the Conformal MatchPoint file does not specify this.  Default: rtl  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each map_activity_file parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man map_activity_file.  "\fB-reset\fR" Specifies to reset and ignore all the previous mapping files specified using the map_activity_file command.  Default : All the previous mapping files specified using the map_activity_file command are loaded and used.  "\fB-rtl2gate <mapping_file>\fR" Specifies instance name mapping between RTL netlist and GATE level netlist. RTL level VCD or TCF are obtained from simulation on RTL Verilog netlist. Power analysis uses this instance name mapping to annotate the output nets of this instance from the pin based RTL VCD or TCF.  The mapping file used for instance name mapping is generated by Conformal.  "\fB-rtl_block <block_name>\fR" Specifies the RTL activity block name to map the block-level RTL mapping files to the top-level RTL activity files. The RTL block name is appended before the RTL level entries in the mapping file to match the entries in the top-level RTL activity file.   "\fB-two_column_mapping_file<mapping_file>\fR" Specifies a file that contains the instance name mapping between the RTL netlist and GATE level netlist.    This parameter can be used to specify a mapping file instead of the LEC generated mapping file (-rtl2gate <mapping_file>) to map points from RTL to Gate netlist. The format of the two column mapping file is:  #Gate name =>  # RTL name  <gate_inst_name1>  => <rtl_inst_name1> 
...   Here, the first column corresponds to the gate name and the second column corresponds to the RTL name. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies a mapping file rtl_map:   map_activity_file -rtl2gate rtl_map
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command performs instance name mapping between RTL netlist and GATE level netlist, wherein the GATE level netlist is Golden and the RTL netlist is Revised; it specifies the mapping file MapFile.alt   map_activity_file -rtl2gate MapFile.alt -golden gate    "*" 2 The following commands appends the RTL block name and GATE block name before the RTL and GATE level entries in the mapping file to match the entries in the top-level RTL activity file:  map_activity_file -rtl2gate LEC.top \\          -rtl_block  "core/block_top" \\          -gate_block "core/block_top"  map_activity_file -rtl2gate LEC.tile.top \\            -rtl_block  "core/tile_instance\\[0\\]/tile_inst" \\            -gate_block "core/tile_instance_0_tile_inst"  "*" 2 The following commands specify to ignore the previous mapping file (old.map), and use the modified mapping file (updated.map):  map_activity_file -rtl2gate old.map  map_activity_file -reset  map_activity_file -rtl2gate updated.map

.P where, G refers to the Golden netlist name and R refers to the Revised netlist name.
.P By default, the tool assumes that the Golden netlist name refers to the RTL net name and Revised netlist refers to the GATE level net name.
