.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setOaxMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setOaxMode.  "\fB-allowAnalysisOnly {true|false}\fR" Allows analysis only flow.  assembleDesign is not allowed when setOaxMode -allowAnalysisOnly is set to false and setOaxMode -updateMode is set to true, thereby locking the OpenAccess databse. To allow assembleDesign to proceed, you must change setOaxMode -allowAnalysisOnly to true. If you set -allowAnalysisOnly to true and the Innovus session is in updateMode = true mode (whether set explicitly or internally on the fly), the -updateMode setting is ignored.   Note that there may be loss of some semantic information, such as MPPs, while saving the design when -allowAnalysisOnly is set to true. However, the saved design would be geometrically correct.  "\fB-allowBitConnection {true | false}\fR" Creates databases for instances that only have bit-based terminals, without requiring the corresponding bus terminals.  When set to true, it saves the connectivity information by bits if the bus connections are not available.  When set to false, an error will be issued if the abstract view is missing expected bus terminal information.  Default: false  "\fB-allowTechUpdate {true | false}\fR" Allows the technology database to be updated. The common reason that a technology database would need to be updated is that new vias have been added to the design that are not in a parameterized form. Via masters that are a simple list of rectangles require that a "custom via" be created in the technology database. If the design library had been created with an attached technology, the value should be set to false, allowing a reference library technology that is shared by multiple designs to have design-specific vias to be added to it. For design libraries that have been created in reference mode, allowing the technology database to be updated is typically fine but normally it is best to always use paramaterized vias for OpenAccess-based flows.  Using setViaGenMode -symmetrical_via_only true before any power planning or routing will typically prevent the creation of non-parameterized vias in the flow.  When -allowTechUpdate is set to false, the creation of the OpenAccess database will fail if any "custom vias" would need to be created within the design library.  Default: true  "\fB-bindkeyFile <fileName>  \fR" Maps into Innovus-equivalent bindkeys. If the bindkey file is not specified, the Virtuoso default bindkey information is used.  Default: This is a string value and its default value is " ".  For more information, see the "SKILL to TCL Mapping" section in the Importing and Exporting Designs chapter of the Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-compressLevel <value>\fR" Sets the compression level of a library during the library creation process. Cellviews written to a library will follow the compression level of the library and not the current setOaxMode -compressLevel setting.  Valid values range between 0 to 9. A value of 0 indicates that compression is turned off.  Default: 1  "\fB-convertTo  {polygon | defaultStyle}\fR" Enables interoperability of the end style of geometries of type path segment between Virtuoso and Innovus.  This parameter applies to the diagonal path segments only.  If the end-style of a diagonal path segment is custom, then the end style is retained as is.  If the end style of a diagonal path segment is not custom, then if you set the value to polygon, Innovus converts the path segment into a geometrically equivalent polygon.  If the value specified is defaultStyle, then the end style of the path segment is set to defaultStyle. In this case, Innovus retains the semantics of the object to be a path segment.Important: To ensure that there is no loss of semantic or geometric information, the path segments in Virtuoso -XL and Virtuoso-GXL should use the custom end-style on diagonal path segments which can be created using Create-Shape-Geometric Wire.  Default: polygon  "\fB-cutRows {true | false}\fR" Cuts rows against placement obstructions, block halos, or power domain fence minimum gaps.  Default: false  "\fB-displayDrfFile<pathName>\fR" Allows you to specify a specific display.drf file that is to be used. It overrides all the searching options and the specified file is used.  Default: String  "\fB-displayDrfInLibrary {true|false}\fR" Allows the tool to search for the display.drf file in the technology library (or complete technology graph in case of ITDB) when set to true. If not found, it looks for the file in the current working directory followed by the home directory.  When set to false, the tool searches for the display.drf file first in the current working directory followed by the home directory.  Default: false  "\fB-drcFillPurpose {gap_fill|drawing}\fR" Specifies whether to save DRCFILL shapes to the gap_fill or drawing purpose. By default, DEF routes with + SHAPE DRCFILL are mapped to the gapFill purpose in OpenAccess. However, some OpenAccess tech files do not have this purpose defined so any shapes mapped to the gapFill purpose would not be visible in Virtuoso and would not be written out in GDS or OASIS. In such cases, set the -drcFillPurpose parameter to drawing to save these shapes to the drawing purpose. When you do so, these shapes get an additional internal attribute so they can round-trip back to DRCFILL shapes properly.  Default: gap_fill  "\fB-encloseQuickAbstractPins {true | false}\fR" Specifies that shapes enclosing the layout pin shapes should be included as part of the pins during Quick Abstract Inference (QAI) pin modeling. Check the Quick Abstract Inference chapter in the Mixed Signal (MS) Interoperability Guide for details.  Default: true  "\fB-fullLayerList {true | false}\fR" Imports the complete list of OpenAccess layers, when importing an OpenAccess design.  If you specify false, only OpenAccess layers defined with oacMaterial an type are imported.  Default: true  "\fB-fullPath {true | false}\fR" Creates the DEFINE statements in the lib.def files using full paths. If you specify -fullPath false, the software creates the statements using relative paths.  Default: false  "\fB-instPlacedIfUnknown {true | false}\fR" Maps the placement status of instances in the OpenAccess database to the placement status in the Innovus software. When set to true, the instances in the OpenAccess database that have an unknown placement status are treated as "placed" in the Innovus software. When set to false, instances with an unknown placement status are treated as "unplaced."  Default: true  "\fB-libCreateMode {none | attach | copy | reference}\fR" Specifies the mode in which saveDesign -cellview creates a library.  none: Turns off the ability to have saveDesign create a library if it does not already exist.  attach: Attaches the technology database specified by the technology library to the library that is to be created.  copy: Copies the technology database specified by techLib to the library specified by libName, and saves the library to the current working directory.  reference: Creates a local technology database in the design library that can be modified incrementally. This is the recommended setting to handle the case where the design may have "custom vias" added at some point by power planning/routing.  Default: reference  "\fB-locking {true | false | errorIfLocked}\fR" Specifies whether or not the OpenAccess database will be locked when the design is restored in Innovus. You can specify one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 false: This is the default option. When set to false, the tool does not check whether the design cell view is locked before restoring the design. The OpenAccess database can continue to be edited by other processes even while the design is restored in Innovus.   Note: If the -updateMode parameter is set to true, the software automatically locks the database, even if the -locking parameter is set to false.   "*" 2 true: When set to true, Innovus locks the design cell view during restoreDesign, provided that it is not already locked by some other tool. With this setting, other tools cannot edit the OpenAccess database as long as it is locked for the Innovus session but they can still access the database in the read-only mode. To remove the lock, specify the freeDesign command or exit the Innovus software.   Note: If the design cell view is already locked by some other tool before restoreDesign, Innovus issues a warning but continues to read in the cell view.  "*" 2 errorIfLocked: If you want the tool to be more restrictive, set the -locking parameter to errorIfLocked. With this option, if the design is already locked while importing or restoring a design, the tool aborts and reports the following error:  **ERROR: (IMPOAX-7995): updateMode/locking is on. Design is already locked by another tool. You are recommended to close this design from another application before proceeding.
.RE   Default: false   Note: The value of -locking cannot be changed while a design is in memory.   "\fB-logicOnlyImport {true | false}\fR" Controls what information the software reads when importing an OpenAccess maskLayout database.  When set to true, the software only reads the logical (Verilog netlist equivalent) connectivity during the init_design process. When set to false (the default value), the software automatically reads physical information (floorplan, placement, routing, etc.) from the database, and updates physical net connectivity for power and ground connections.  Note: The -logicOnlyImport parameter only applies to OpenAccess maskLayout databases. For other types of OpenAccess databases, the software always only reads the logical connectivity.  Default: false  "\fB-merge_trim {true|false}\fR" Merges the trim metal shapes during save when the trim metal gap is less than or equal to the max_gap settings defined with setDesignMode -merge_trim_shapes. Refer to setDesignMode -merge_trim_shapes for detailed merging options.  Default: true  "\fB-pinPurpose {true | false}\fR" Writes out pin shapes with the purpose pin. When set to false, writes out pin shapes with the purpose drawing.  Default: false  "\fB-pushPinConstraint {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether or not saveDesign or saveOaBlackboxes should push an interoperable pin constraint into its corresponding blackbox abstract cellview.  Note: Interoperable pin constraints refer to pin constraints that are understood by Innovus, Virtuoso, and PVS.  Default: false  "\fB-quickAbstractForCustomCells {pcells | stdcells | all |off}  \fR" Trims design shapes of custom cells. By default, this capability is turned on for all types of custom cells. The following settings are allowed for this parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 pcells - Trims design shapes of only custom parameterized cells (PCells).  "*" 2 stdcells - Trims design shapes of only custom standard cells.  "*" 2 all - Trims design shapes of all custom cells.  "*" 2 off - Does not trim design shapes of any custom cell.
.RE   Note: This feature needs the INVS30 (Innovus Mixed Signal Option) license. If this license is not available, the abstract that gets generated for custom cells will not work properly in Innovus.  Default: all  "\fB-readSystemReservedLayers {all | text | off}\fR" Reads the system-reserved layers from the PDK. The following settings are supported:
.RS  "*" 2 all - All system-reserved layers are read.  "*" 2 text - Only text layer is read.  "*" 2 off - No system-reserved layer is read.
.RE   Default: all  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setOaxMode parameters to their default values. Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.   If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  "\fB-saveCdsFixedVias {new_vias_only | off}\fR" Controls how fixed/custom vias are created in OpenAccess library when saving a design from Innovus to OpenAccess:
.RS  "*" 2 off - No cdsFixedVias are created. All fixed/custom vias in the design are saved as oaCustomVia.  "*" 2 new_vias_only - Any newly created custom via is saved as a fixed via while any pre-existing custom via in the Incremental Technology Database (ITDB) is reused when saving the design.  Note: This feature needs the INVS30 (Innovus Mixed Signal Option) license. If this license is not available, the default off value will be used and no fixed vias will be created.
.RE   Default: off   "\fB-saveMaskDataLocked {true | false}\fR" Sets the shapes with mask coloring (mask values other than 0) to locked in the saved cellview, when set to true.  By default, oaOut and saveDesign write out shapes with their mask coloring information in an unlocked state. Some tools treat the unlocked color information as the recommended color. However, for some foundry processes, shapes with unlocked mask coloring information are written to GDSII/Stream as gray (uncolored). In such cases, set the -saveMaskDataLocked parameter to true to lock the mask coloring of shapes explicitly.  Note: This option affects only the saving of shapes with non-zero mask coloring values. Review the map file that will be used to create GDSII/Stream output from the OpenAccess cellview to determine if the map file requires shapes to be locked for them to be written out as colored.  Default: false  "\fB-saveNetVoltage {true | false}\fR" Saves the minimum and maximum net voltage across all loaded timing views to every net. When this parameter is set to true, write_db writes voltage information to the voltage attribute of oaBitNet. This is useful for Virtuoso, and other tools that may read the cellview, to understand the minimum and maximum net voltage without needing to interpret the CPF or
.lib file to get that information. Roundtrip of the information into Innovus is not dependent on this setting.  Default: false  "\fB-saveRelativePath {true | false}\fR" Defines the current working directory ($cwd) in the configuration file as ".". When set to true, a design can be restored, even if the directory path of the design file is changed.  Default: true  "\fB-saveRestoreFile {true | false}\fR" Creates the view.inn file when the saveDesign command is run with the -cellview or -view arguments. The view.inn file is a file that can be sourced to read the cellview that was saved into a new Innovus session. The file name will be the specified view name with the
.inn suffix added.   When saveDesign is used in the <sessionName> style (without -cellview or -view specified), the inn file will always be created. In the <sessionName> style, the inn file will have the name specified by the user even if the view name has the
.inn omitted (if the
.inn suffix is not specified, the file and view names will be the same).  Set the -saveRestoreFile parameter to true to create an inn file that can be sourced. The use of the inn file makes it easier to write scripts that are more generic and work across multiple designs by depending only on the view name and not the design library or cell name.    Default: false  "\fB-silently_ignore_unsupported_vias {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether restoreDesign should issue messages about vias that are not supported in Innovus when a Virtuoso design is read in.  Default: false  "\fB-textPurpose <purpose_name>\fR" Specifies the purpose name that will be used when text labels are written.  By default, any text label created in Innovus (typically via the add_text command) is automatically mapped to the drawing purpose. Use the -textPurpose parameter to map the text labels to a user-defined purpose.  Note: setOaxMode -textPurpose <purpose_name> overrides the default drawing purpose on output.   Default: drawing  "\fB-tieNet {<tieHighNetName><tieLowNetName>}\fR" Specifies the global tie high and tie low net names to be created in the OpenAccess database. The nets are used to represent the Verilog 1'b1/1'b0 connections to the instance ports. Typically, tie1 and tie0 are used as tie high and tie low net names, respectively. If these names exist in the design locally in any module, then the global names should be changed.  Default: ""  "\fB-updateMode {true | false | auto}\fR" Specifies whether or not to save or restore an OpenAccess design in update mode.  If the -updateMode parameter is set to true, restoreDesign -cellview processes parameterized cells (PCells) and other custom objects correctly in the Innovus database. For information about generating/regenerating the PCell cache, refer to the "Preparing the IP Library" section in the Technology Data Preparation chapter of the Mixed Signal (MS)  Interoperability Guide.  -updateMode true also ensures that saveDesign -cellview updates the Innovus-modified portion of an OpenAccess database without making changes to PCells or other custom objects.  Note: In the setOaxMode -updateMode true mode, the tool locks the source cellview for the duration of the Innovus session.   The updateMode parameter provides the ability to import an OpenAccess database created from Virtuoso that contains objects which are not understood by Innovus. Complete the digital part in Innovus and update only the objects modified by Innovus in the original OpenAccess database. If your design has any of the following objects, they would only be visible (not editable) in Innovus:
.RS  "*" 2 PCells
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Modgen cells
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Fig-groups
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 PCell vias
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 RODs (Example, Multi-Part Paths, and so on)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 User defined properties on design objects such as nets, shapes (lxStickyNet), instances, abstract views, intermediate hierarchical instances, and so on.
.RE   You won't be allowed to edit or modify these objects.  On using this parameter, the property on shapes (for example, lxStickyNet) and nets created in VLS-XL / GXL would be kept as-is.  In case of designs where parameterized vias are used, Innovus understands these parameters and evaluates them on-the-fly to create an exact shape and orientation of the cuts.  If the -updateMode parameter is set to auto and the cellview contains objects that are not supported in Innovus, the software internally enables update mode with a message such as follows:  INFO: Objects have been found in the cellview requiring updateMode to be enabled so that there is no loss of semantic information when the cellview is saved.  Note that enabling update mode can affect saveDesign performance.  Default: false   Note: The value of -updateMode cannot be changed while a design is in memory. If this parameter has been set to true before importing an OpenAccess design into Innovus, you cannot convert -updateMode to false in any new Innovus session.   Note: The on-disk OpenAccess cellview is locked between the restore and save steps when -updateMode is set to true.   Note: In -updateMode auto, the lock is applied at the time that oaIn or restoreDesign starts and released at the end of the command if no objects were encountered that required updateMode to be enabled.   "\fB-useVirtuosoColor {true|false}\fR" Allows you to display colors and stipples for the design layers (including full custom layers). Using this parameter, Innovus utilizes the same colors and stipples that you would see if you open the design in Virtuoso.  Default: false  "\fB-useVirtuosoBindkey {true|false}\fR" Allows you to use Virtuoso bindkeys.  Default: false  "\fB-viewSubType {VCE | VXL | none}}\fR" Indicates which Virtuoso application should be used for viewing the layout cellviews in the saved OpenAccess database.  When set to VCE, cellviews are opened in Virtuoso Chip Editor.  When set to VXL, cellviews are opened in Virtuoso XL.  When set to none, it indicates that the OpenAccess database can be edited by any editor within Virtuoso platform based on its license availability.  Default: VXL
