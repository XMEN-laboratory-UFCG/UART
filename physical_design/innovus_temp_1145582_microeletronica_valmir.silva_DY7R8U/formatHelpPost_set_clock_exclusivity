.TH set_clock_exclusivity  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_clock_exclusivity\fR \-  Controls filtering of mutually-exclusive clocks at strategic points in the design, e.g., the output of clock multiplexers
.SH Syntax \fBset_clock_exclusivity\fR  [-help]  [-exclude_opposite_polarity]  [-exclude_related_input_pins]  [-exclude_same_polarity]  [-group <clock_list>]  <pin_name> 
.P Controls filtering of mutually-exclusive clocks at strategic points in the design, e.g., the output of clock multiplexers. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-exclude_opposite_polarity\fR" Isolates positive and negative phases of the clocks in the same group. By default, the positive and negative phases of the clocks in the same group that arrive at a strategic point will not be isolated from each other.  "\fB-exclude_related_input_pins\fR" Allows comparison of clocks going through the same input pins of the specified gate.   "\fB-exclude_same_polarity\fR" Allows comparison of clocks going through the same launch or capture paths.  "\fB-group <clock_list>\fR" Defines a set of clocks that are exclusive to the clocks defined in all other groups.  "\fB<pin_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the pin. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command will cause downstream analysis from the mux to isolate interactions between the groups:   set_clock_exclusivity -group {CLK1 CLK2} -group {CLK3 CLK4} U1/Y  This assertion will cause downstream analysis from pin U1/Y to isolate interactions between the groups. The groups {CLK1 CLK2} and {CLK3 CLK4} are allowed, but all other combinations are considered logically exclusive.
