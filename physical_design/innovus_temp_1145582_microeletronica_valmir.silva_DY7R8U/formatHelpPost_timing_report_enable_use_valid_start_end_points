.SH Name \fBtiming_report_enable_use_valid_start_end_points\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_report_enable_use_valid_start_end_points\fR    {true | false}
.P Default: false
.P Shows valid start/end points in the timing report.
.P When set to true, the valid start/end points are included in the timing report. The paths are reported with the report_timing command - when the pins passed (-from and -to) are the actual begin and end pins of the data path. For example, for a register the begin pin is register's CK pin and the end pin is register's D pin. Similarly, an input pin in a path is the path's begin pin and output pin is the path's end pin.
.P When set to false, any point in a path can be used as a -from point and is considered as a -through point internally. All the pins using -from/-to are treated as -through pins. Therefore, a path is reported with register's Q pin as a from pin, even though the correct start pin is a CK pin. Or any intermediate pin belonging to a path can be passed as -from/-to and the path will still be reported to correct start/end pins with the given pin lying somewhere in between of path.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
