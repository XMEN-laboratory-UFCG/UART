.SH Name \fBsetShrinkFactor\fR \-  Sets the value by which the software shrinks the design before extraction. The shrink factor is used only for extraction calculations
.SH Syntax \fBsetShrinkFactor\fR  [-help]  <shrinkFactor> 
.P Sets the value by which the software shrinks the design before extraction. The shrink factor is used only for extraction calculations. It does not change the actual design.
.P Note: You do not need to specify the shrink factor if the capacitance table file in use contains the shrink factor specification in its header. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for the setShrinkFactor parameter. For a detailed description of the command and its parameter, use the man command: man setShrinkFactor.  "\fB<shrinkFactor>\fR" Specifies the value by which the software shrinks a design.   Default: 1.0 
.SH Example
.P The following command sets the shrink factor to 0.9:
.P setShrinkFactor 0.9
.P Setting the shrink factor to 0.9 reduces the wire lengths, widths, and spacings in the design by 0.9 times the original values.
