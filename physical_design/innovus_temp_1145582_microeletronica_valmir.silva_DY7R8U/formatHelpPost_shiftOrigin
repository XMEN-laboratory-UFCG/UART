.SH Syntax \fBshiftOrigin\fR  [-help]  {-center | -lowerLeft | -location <x y> | -delta <x y>}
.P Shifts the entire design to a new location. All objects that are recorded in DEF are shifted to a new location. No change is made to the other attributes of objects except the location. All properties and characters such as orientation and placement status remain the same after the shift.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB-center\fR" Shifts the origin point of the entire design to the center point of the current floorplan box.  Example: shiftOrigin -center  Before:   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After:(<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-delta <x y>\fR" Shifts the origin point of the entire design by the specified distance, deltaX and deltaY  Example: shiftOrigin -delta 500 500  Before:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: point, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each shiftOrigin parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man shiftOrigin  "\fB-location <x y>   \fR" Shifts the origin point of the entire design to the specified location, <x y>.  Example: shiftOrigin -location 300 300  Before:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: point, optional  "\fB-lowerLeft\fR" Shifts the origin point of the entire design to the lower left point of current floorplan box.  Example: shiftOrigin -lowerLeft  Before:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional
