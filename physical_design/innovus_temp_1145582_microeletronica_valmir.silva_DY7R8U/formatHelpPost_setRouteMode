.P Sets global parameters for the Early Global Route or earlyGlobalRoute. The parameters that you specify with setRouteMode are then used automatically whenever you run the Early Global Router through the earlyGlobalRoute command or internally during in-place optimization, partitioning, or placement. 
.P The setRouteMode command parameter settings affect the results of the Early Global Router, which is run in all the steps during the preRoute flow. Consequently, with changes in these settings, the results of  place_opt_design, ccopt_design, and postCTS will change.
.P Note: If not required, it is best not to change the tool technology settings.
.P Use the getRouteMode command to return the current settings for the setRouteMode command.
.P Early Global Route supports nested partitions. The partitions specified with the -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorFence and the -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorPin parameters are routed in the style that honors fence and pin constraints. All other partitions are routed 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-earlyGlobalEffortLevel {standard| medium | low }\fR" Specifies the congestion effort level.  Note: The low effort level value will reduce the runtime while standard effort level will increase the congestion accuracy
.RS  "*" 2 standard: Congestion is more accurate and runtime is larger.  "*" 2 medium:  Runtime will be much smaller and congestion report will have less accuracy.  "*" 2 low: Runtime is faster than medium but less accurate.
.RE   Default: standard  Note: While the setRouteMode -earlyGlobalEffortLevel parameter is mainly used for speed (low and medium will make it faster but less accurate), the setDesignMode -congEffort parameter is used to increase optimization effort to resolve congestion. Even though these parameters are not related directly, changing the Early Global Route effort level (decreasing it ) will change the results for the required congestion effort. Hence, if you set the setDesignMode-congEffort as high, it is recommended that you keep the setRouteMode -earlyGlobalEffortLevel parameter at standard (default) level.  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setRouteMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setRouteMode.  "\fB-earlyGlobalHonorMsvRouteConstraint {true | false}\fR" Honors MSV domain constraints. This option is used to decide whether  Early Global Route  should honor power domain settings.  By default, Early Global Route ignores the power domain settings and routes as flat design. When enabled, Early Global Route honors power domain settings and route wires inside preferred power domain as much as possible.  Default : false  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalNumTracksPerClockWire value\fR" Specifies the special number of tracks per clock wires.  Max: 8  Min: 0  Default: 0    Data_type: int, optional   "\fB-reset         \fR" Restores all parameters modified using setRouteMode to their default settings. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setRouteMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-earlyGlobalReverseDirection  "<( x1 y1 x2 y2 )  Metal2:Metal2  ( x3 y3 x4 y4 )  Metal3:Metal3
...> "  \fR" Reverses the routing direction in the given region on the specified layer-range. It specifies an area in which the Early Global Router routes wires in the non-preferred direction.   Note: You can define the reverse direction routing area by (<x1 y1 x2 y2>) and routing layer by< Metal2:Metal2>. In release 16.1, the Early Global Router only supports a single layer with this option. Consequently, <Metal2:Metal3> is not supported.  The -earlyGlobalReverseDirection parameter only has impact on the congestion value calculation. By routing on reverse direction, you can reduce the routing capacity on the specified layer and add extract resource on the above and below layers. Innovus does not display the routing wires in reverse direction routing region.  For example, the following command reverses the routing direction in the specified region on layer<Metal3>.  setRouteMode -earlyGlobalReverseDirection "(757.996 542.697 995.323 772.5685) Metal3:Metal3"  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   The congestion value without reverse direction routing:  Overflow after earlyGlobalRoute 0.02% H + 0.00% V  The congestion value with reverse direction routing:  earlyGlobalRoute overflow: 0.93% H + 0.10% V  Default: ""  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalRouteBumpNets {true|false}\fR" Specifies that the Early Global Router will honor a net with a connecting bump and enable bump net routing.  By default, Early Global Route ignores bump nets as they are marked as special in the database. When enabled, the Early Global Route honors bump nets and routes them.  Default: false  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalRoutePartitionAllowFeedthru <list_of_ptn_cell_names>\fR" Specifies the partition cell names for which the Early Global Router honors partition fences.  Default :  ""  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorFence <list_of_ptn_cell_names>\fR" Honors partition fences with a single-entry constraint and also honors fixed pins. Under the single-entry constraint once a hierarchical route enters a partition fence it does not cross the boundary again. The -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorFence parameter routes a net belonging to more than one partition so that the routing does not violate partition boundaries, in addition to routing intra-partition and global nets using the specifications of the partitions. For example, if a net belongs to partitions P1 and P3, but not P2, the net is routed without going over the P2 partition boundary.  Notes:
.RS  "*" 2 For flat partitioned designs, you can specify -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorFence to simulate channel-based routing. For channelless designs, you must perform feedthrough insertion before using this parameter.  "*" 2 Supports designs with up to 180 partitions.  "*" 2 Early Global Route supports nested partitions. The partitions specified with the -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorFence and the -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorPin parameters are routed in the style that honors fence and pin constraints. All other partitions are routed flat.
.RE   Default :  ""  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorPin <list_of_ptn_cell_names>\fR" Honors partition fences with single-entry constraint and pre-assigned pins (pins marked  FIXED ) and assigned pins (pins marked  PLACED ).  Default: ""  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalRoutePartitionPinGuide {true | false}\fR" Honors partition pin guides. It uses the pin guide statements in the floorplan file to guide the routing through partition pin points.  Note: Fixed pins and pin guides are only honored when -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionPinGuide is true.  Default: true  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalRouteSecondPG {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether the secondary PG pin should be routed or not. When enabled, it routes the pin specified by the setPGPinUseSignalRoute command.   Default: false   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalRouteSelectedNetsOnly {true | false}\fR" Specifies that only the nets that are selected in the database are to be routed.  Default: false   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalRouteStripeLayerRange { <layerIdx1>:<layerIdx2>} \fR" Specifies the stripe layer range that is routed to the secondary PG pin.  Default: " "  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalSecondPGMaxFanout <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum fanout value during secondary PG pin routing.  Max:INT_MAX  Min:1  Default: 2147483647  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-earlyGlobalSupplyScaleFactorH <value>  \fR" Specifies the Scale H supply by a specified ratio.  Max : 1.250000   Min : 0.750000   Default : 1     Data_type: float, optional   "\fB-earlyGlobalSupplyScaleFactorV <value>  \fR" Specifies the Scale V supply by a specified ratio.  Max: 1.250000  Min: 0.750000  Default: 1   Data_type: float, optional
