.SH Name \fBtiming_check_timing_signal_level_low_to_high_threshold\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_check_timing_signal_level_low_to_high_threshold\fR double  
.P Default: 0
.P Sets the threshold value for warning the signal level difference between driver and receiver voltages, when the driver is at a lower voltage than the receiver voltage.
.P The software shows the signal level warnings (check_timing signal_level) that report the net driver/receiver pin pairs for which the pin voltage does not match. The signal level warning messages can be filtered based on these threshold values. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
