.SH Name \fBtiming_cppr_opposite_edge_mean_scale_factor\fR \-  Default: 1.0

.SH Syntax \fBtiming_cppr_opposite_edge_mean_scale_factor\fR   {0.0 | 1.0} 
.P Default: 1.0
.P Controls the mean delay component for CPPR credit for opposite transition edges at a common pin.
.P When this global variable is specified, the software provides a finer level configuration of the CPPR credit for reducing Common Path Pessimism Removal (CPPR) in timing analysis. The software allows a certain amount of CPPR credit in the case of opposite edge transitions to be scaled to a user-specified value, that is between zero credit or full credit provided by the existing controls.
.P You can use timing_cppr_opposite_edge_sigma_scale_factor global variable for adjustment of the sigma component of the CPPR credit. In SOCV analysis mode, you can use both of these global variables to separately control the adjustment of the mean and sigma components of the CPPR credit. In regular static-timing analysis (STA) mode (without SOCV), only the mean scale factor is considered for CPPR adjustment scaling.
.P You can use the set command to set this global variable.
