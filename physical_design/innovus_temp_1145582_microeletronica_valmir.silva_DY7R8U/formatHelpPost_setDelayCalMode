.P Sets global parameters for delay calculation. Use this command to specify any required delay calculation mode settings before running any commands that perform delay calculation, such as timing analysis and optimization. The parameters specified with the setDelayCalMode command are then used automatically whenever delay calculation takes place.
.P Use thegetDelayCalMode command to return the current settings for the setDelayCalMode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setDelayCalMode parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man setDelayCalMode.   "\fB-accuracy_level <level>\fR" Sets the accuracy level for delay calculations.  You can use the -accuracy_level parameter to enable new enhancements for different process nodes (without using the setDesignMode -process parameter).  Note: However, you can set the setDesignMode -process parameter to enable the delay accuracy level equivalent to the values given below:  setDesignMode -process 16 == setDelayCalMode -accuracy_level 0  setDesignMode -process 10 == setDelayCalMode -accuracy_level 1  setDesignMode -process 7 == setDelayCalMode -accuracy_level 2  setDesignMode -process 5 == setDelayCalMode -accuracy_level 3   setDesignMode -process 3 == setDelayCalMode -accuracy_level 4  Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 4  "\fB-advanced_pincap_mode {0 | 1 | 2}\fR" Simulates the current stage and receiver stages together, such that the back miller effect is modeled dynamically. You can specify the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 0: Receiver current sources are computed using ECSM/CCS capacitance tables with the estimated input slew.  "*" 2 1: Receivers are no longer modeled as simple non-linear current source models. This results in increasing the delay calculation accuracy significantly as the modeling back miller effect improves.  "*" 2 2:  Uses advanced simulation-based approach to model the receiver back miller effect.
.RE   Default: 0  "\fB-advanced_node_pin_cap_settings {true | false}\fR" Enables advanced node pin cap settings.  Default: false  "\fB-combine_mmmc {none | early_late | early_late_corner}\fR" Specifies whether delay calculation runs are to be combined for delay calculation simulations. This parameter provides user control for improving the run time of AAE for all analysis types by combining runs for early and late simulations into a single simulation. The views with common delay corners may also be combined into a single delay calculation simulation for added run time improvement.  You can specify one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 none: Combines any delay calculation runs. Individual delay calculation simulations are performed for early and late simulations. This may result in significant CPU performance degradation due to the increased number of simulation runs performed.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 early_late: Combines early and late simulations of a single corner into one delay calculation simulation. This will improve CPU performance by avoiding unnecessary delay calculation simulations.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 early_late_corner: Combines early and late simulations of a single corner, and also combines views with common delay corners into a single delay calculation simulation. For example, the software will combine views with different set_case_analysis statements in one single simulation. This can result in a significant improvement in the CPU performance by avoiding unnecessary delay calculation simulations.
.RE   Default: early_late_corner  "\fB-early_irdrop_data_type {best_average | worst | best | average | worst_average}\fR" Allows you to set the early IR drop EIV values for different EIV voltages.  Default: worst  "\fB-enable_high_fanout {true | false}\fR" When this parameter is set to true, the default net delay will be annotated on high fanout nets. A net will be treated as a high fanout net when the fanout is more than the limit specified using the delaycal_use_default_delay_limitdelaycal_use_default_delay_limit global variable. The default value of this variable is 1000 fanouts. The default net delay is also specified using this variable. The default net delay is 1ns. The cell delay will use the lumped capacitance that is specified using the delaycal_default_net_loaddelaycal_default_net_load global variable  for table lookup. The default net load is 0.5pF. The driver slew will use the default value of 0ps, which can be changed by using the delaycal_input_transition_delaydelaycal_input_transition_delay global variable and there will be no slew degradation along the interconnect.  The default value of this parameter is false.  "\fB-enable_quiet_receivers_for_hold {true | false}\fR" When set to true, the software forces some receivers as static (quiet). To compute the worst-case delays for early analysis, the software assumes that the receivers are not switching. This yields more conservative early delays.  When set to false, the software assumes receivers may switch.  Default: false  "\fB -equivalent_waveform_model {none | no_propagation | propagation}\fR" Controls the equivalent waveform model to be used. You can specify one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 none: When this option is specified, the waveform shape beyond slew measurement points does not impact delays. This mode is equivalent to setting the following options in the previous releases:  setDelayCalMode -equivalent_waveform_model_type none  setDelayCalMode -equivalent_waveform_model_propagation false  "*" 2  no_propagation: In this mode, the impact of receiver waveform shape on the next stage delay is estimated and adjusted the net delay of the current stage. This mode is equivalent to setting the following options in the previous releases:  setDelayCalMode -equivalent_waveform_model_type ecsm  setDelayCalMode -equivalent_waveform_model_propagation false  "*" 2 propagation: When specified, the impact of input waveform shape is considered during delay calculation and the waveforms are propagated across each stage of the entire path.This mode is equivalent to setting the following options in the previous releases:  setDelayCalMode -equivalent_waveform_model_type ecsm  setDelayCalMode -equivalent_waveform_model_propagation true
.RE 
.RE   Default: none  "\fB-equivalent_waveform_model_for_timing_check {true | false}\fR" Models the waveform distortion effect for timing check value look ups at both the data and clock pins.  The model uses simulations to convert the distorted waveforms into equivalent waveforms (pre-driver waveforms in the libraries) by matching the pin CCB output waveforms. This feature requires the CCSN library.  Default: false  "\fB-ewm_type {moments | simulation}  \fR" Specifies the equivalent waveform model (EWM) to be used. The options are described below:  
.RS  "*" 2 moments: Enables moment-based equivalent waveform model.  "*" 2 simulation: Enables simulation-based equivalent waveform model. The simulation-based EWM is required for predicting delay in noisy waveforms.  The simulation option requires noise models (ECSMN/CCSN). If noise models are not available, then the software defaults to moments-based EWM.
.RE   It is recommended to use simulation-based EWM as it is more accurate than moment-based EWM.   Default: moments  "\fB-honorSlewPropConstraint {true | false}\fR" Determines whether to propagate the slew from the disabled timing arcs to the output pin. When this parameter is set to false, the slew from the disabled timing arc affects the delay of the next stage. Setting this parameter to false results in more accurate slew computation for the disabled timing arcs but can take longer run time.  When set to true, the timing constraints defined using commands such as set_disable_timing and set_case_analysis impact the slew propagation, and the slew from the disabled timing arcs is not propagated.  Default : true  "\fB-irdrop_data_type {best_average | worst | best | average | worst_average}\fR" Allows you to set the early/late IR drop EIV values for different EIV voltages.  Default: worst  "\fB-irDrop_window_based {none | late | early | both}\fR" Searches window-based EIV values from the EIV database.  Default: both  "\fB-late_irdrop_data_type {best_average | worst | best | average | worst_average}\fR" Allows you to set the late IR drop EIV values for different EIV voltages.  Default: worst  "\fB-library_interpolation_mode {linear | non_linear}\fR" Controls library scaling mode - linear or non_linear - for the interpolation flow.  Default: linear  "\fB-ignoreNetLoad {true | false}\fR" When set to true, this parameter removes the default system requirement for having RC parasitics available for delay calculation.  This parameter is used to get initial design timing when the design is not in a proper state to generate extracted results and an external SPEF source of parasitics is not available. The results obtained by enabling this parameter are equivalent to those obtained using a zero-cap, zero-resistance wire-load model for estimating delays.   Default : false  "\fB-reportOutBound {true | false}\fR" Generates a report that contains a list of index values (input transition) in the delay tables that are beyond the index range. The index values detected by this parameter can cause inaccurate delay values to be calculated. The report generated by this parameter can be used for debugging.  When this parameter is set to true, the extrapolation information will be dumped into the following two files:
.RS  "*" 2 <design-name>.dc.outbound.slew.early.<view-name>.txt
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 <design-name>.dc.outbound.slew.late.<view-name>.txt
.RE   The software writes a warning message in the log files noting that there are input transition values that are out of the index range of the timing table. The warning message also provides the file name for viewing the detail report.  When set to true, the -reportOutBound parameter will generate reports that can be controlled using the setOutboundReport command.  Default: false  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setDelayCalMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Note: Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-SIAware {true | false}\fR" Enables SIAware delay calculation that also includes cross-talk induced delays.  Default: false  Note: SIAware delay calculation requires the design to be in Multi-Mode, Multi-Corner (MMMC) Mode and the analysis type to be set to on-chip variations.  Note: The timeDesign and optDesign -postRoute commands will set the -siAware option to true to perform SI analysis. To disable SI analysis at the post-route stage you must explicitly set -siAware to false, so that base analysis is performed.  "\fB-skip_slew_merge_from_disabled_path {false | true}\fR" Avoids merging slews from unconstrained, segmented paths and black-box output pin.  When set to true, the software does not allow merging transitions from disabled paths.  Default: false  "\fB-signoff_alignment_settings {true | false}\fR" Enables signoff alignment settings.  Default: false  "\fB-slewOutBoundLimitHigh <value>\fR" Limits the maximum slew used in the analysis to the specified value.  Min: 1  Max: 3.40282346638529e  Data type: float  Default: 3.40282346638529e+38   "\fB-slewOutBoundLimitLow <value>\fR" Limits the minimum slew used in the analysis to the specified value.  Min: 0.001  Max: 1  Data type: float  Default: 0.5   "\fB-socv_accuracy_mode {low | medium | high | ultra}\fR" Allows the ability to control levels of accuracy.  This parameter specifies level-based accuracy effort for delays and slews. You can use one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 low: Ignores correlation between slews and delays. This is the default setting.  "*" 2 medium: Models correlation between immediate slew and delay.  "*" 2 high: Considers skewness of non-gaussian distribution into account for computing quantiles.  The skewness is local to one stage only.   "*" 2 ultra: Considers skewness of non-gaussian distribution, and also propagates skewness to the next stage in PBA analysis.
.RE   "\fB-socv_lvf_mode {moments | early_late}\fR" Controls interpretation of LVF data.  Default: moments  "\fB-socv_machine_learning_level {0 | 1}\fR" Enables the SOCV machine learning mode.  For accurate SOCV analysis, the software creates several statistical models, which are not available with standard LVF library, such as correlation between cells delay and output slew,  conversion of moments from late/early sigma tables, and effects of waveform distortion on sigma and mean shift. When the -socv_machine_learning_level parameter is set to 1, the software enables several machine learning algorithms to generate such models internally.   Default: 0  "\fB-socv_use_lvf_tables {all | delay | slew | constraint}\fR" Controls which type of variations are considered during analysis.  Default: all
