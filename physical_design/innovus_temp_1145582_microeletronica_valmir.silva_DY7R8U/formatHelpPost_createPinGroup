.SH Name \fBcreatePinGroup\fR \-  Creates a pin group for a partition or for the top-level
.SH Syntax \fBcreatePinGroup\fR   [-help]   [-cell <string>]   [-excludePin {allLayer | sameLayer | allLayerInGuidedArea}]   [-keep_out_spacing <integer>]  [-spacing <integer>]   [-width <width>]  [{[-optimizeOrder ]} | -spreadPin | -compact_area ]   [{<pinGroupName> [-pin {<pinNameList>}]} ]
.P Creates a pin group for a partition or for the top-level. Pin groups in conjunction with pin guides are used to guide pin placement when the assignIoPins or assignPtnPin command is called. A pin group is a first class data object-delete with the  deletePinGroup command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-cell <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the module or submodule to which the pin group applies. This parameter is not required if the pin group being created is for the top level.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-compact_area\fR" Specifies that pins in the group are assigned tightly together. By default, pins which are part of a group and associated to a guide can be spread inside the guide based on the area available and alignment to targets. The compact_area option, when used, ignores the alignment and available area and forces the pins to the minimum area on guide honoring the minimum spacing constraint and overlooking any alignment to targets.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-excludePin {allLayer | sameLayer | allLayerInGuidedArea }\fR" Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins on all layers, same layer, or on all layers in the guided area.
.RS  "*" 2 allLayer: Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins between grouped pins on all layers.  "*" 2 sameLayer: Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins between grouped pins on the same layer.  "*" 2 allLayerInGuidedArea: Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins in the guide area defined for the group, on all layers.
.RE    Note: If a guide is not defined for a pin group, -excludePin allLayerInGuidedArea option is treated like -excludePin {allLayer}.  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each createPinGroup parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:    man createPinGroup  "\fB-keep_out_spacing <integer>\fR" Specifies the minimum spacing between the pins named in the pin group and any other pins, in number of tracks.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 65535  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-optimizeOrder\fR" Specifies that pins in the group are to be reordered to optimize wire length during pin placement. Otherwise the pin order is exactly as specified in the pin group.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pin {<pinNameList>}\fR" Specifies the pins to be added to the pin group. Additional pins can be added subsequently with the addPinToPinGroupcommand.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB<pinGroupName>\fR" Specifies the name of the pin group.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-spacing <integer>\fR" Specifies the minimum spacing between the pins of the pin group, in number of tracks.  Default: Two tracks.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-spreadPin\fR" Specifies that pins in the group are distributed evenly.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-width width\fR" Specifies the pin width, in microns.  Data_type: float, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a pin group PG_A22 for module SH17 and adds the pins pinA22_1 and pinA22_2 to it.   createPinGroup PG_A22 -cell SH17 -pin {pinA22_1 pinA22_2}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a pin group PG_A for module SH17 and adds the pins pinA22_1 and pinA22_2 to it.  No other pins are to be placed between pinA22_1 and pinA22_2 in any layer.   The pins may be reordered to optimize wire length.   createPinGroup PG_A22 -cell SH17 -pin {pinA22_1 pinA22_2} -excludePin allLayer -optimizeOrder   "*" 2 The following command deletes the pin group PinGroup17 of module SH17:  deletePinGroup -cell SH17 -pinGroup PinGroup17
