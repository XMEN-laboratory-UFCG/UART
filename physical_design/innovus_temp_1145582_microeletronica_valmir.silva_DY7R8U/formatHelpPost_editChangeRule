.TH editChangeRule  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBeditChangeRule\fR \-  Changes the LEF rule associated with selected wire segments from the <old_rule>to the <new_rule>
.SH Syntax \fBeditChangeRule\fR  [-help]   [-from <old_rule>]  -to <new_rule> 
.P Changes the LEF rule associated with selected wire segments from the <old_rule>to the <new_rule>. You must select the wires for which the rule needs to be changed before running editChangeRule. You can select wires either using the GUI or by using the editSelect command.
.P Note: This command does not change the routing rule for the net. If the net is re-routed by NanoRoute, these changes will be lost. To change the routing rule, use setAttribute -net -non_default_rule. For more information, see setAttribute. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editChangeRule parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man editChangeRule  "\fB-from <old_rule>\fR" Specifies the qualifying rule. Only wire segments whose associated rule matches <old_rule> are changed. If you do not specify this parameter, the tool will change the rule of all selected wires.  "\fB-to <new_rule>\fR" Specifies the destination rule. Wire segments originally associated with <old_rule> are associated with <new_rule> after this command runs.  Specify one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 A nondefault rule defined in the LEF LAYER (Routing) section
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 default (applies the default routing rule)
.RE 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command changes the wire segments that are associated with the rule SP to the default rule. If the wire width or extension of SP is different from its counterpart in the default rule, the wire geometry is changed accordingly.   editChangeRule -from SP -to default
