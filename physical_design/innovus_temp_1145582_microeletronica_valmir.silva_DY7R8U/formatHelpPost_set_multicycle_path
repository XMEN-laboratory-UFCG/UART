.SH Name \fBset_multicycle_path\fR \-  Specifies multicycle paths between specific timing paths in the design or between clock domains
.SH Syntax  \fBset_multicycle_path\fR  [-hold]  [-setup]  [-start | -end]   {[{-from | -rise_from | -fall_from} <from_list>]  [{-through | -rise_through | -fall_through} <through_list>]  [{-to | -rise_to | -fall_to} <to_list>]}   [-rise]  [-fall]   [-comment <string>]   <number_of_cycles> 
.P Specifies multicycle paths between specific timing paths in the design or between clock domains. Multicycle paths are timing paths that require more than one clock period for execution. By default, all paths are considered as one cycle paths for setup and hold check evaluation. The set_multicycle_path command lets you specify additional cycles for the paths. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-comment <string>\fR" Allows you to insert comments. The comments are read but are ignored with a one-time warning message. They are not used during timing analysis reporting nor are they written out during saving of constraints.  "\fB-fall\fR" Applies the assertion at the falling edge of the signal on the path endpoints.  "\fB{-from | -rise_from | -fall_from} <from_list>\fR" Specifies the clocks, ports, pins, or sequential instances that are at the start of the multicycle paths.  The port direction can be either input or inout. Pins must be valid path startpoints such as sequential instance clock pins, latch data pins or pins on which input delays have been specified. Pins can be on intermediate hierarchical boundaries. The <from_list> variable can contain either collection IDs or object names.  If the -from option is used without the -to option, all paths originating from the from_list are multicycle paths.  Use either the -from, -to, or -through option with the set_multicycle_path command to identify the paths.  Specifying both the -from and -to options identifies a path with specific starting and ending points.  Use only one -from, -rise_from, or -fall_from option per command.  "\fB-hold | -setup\fR" Specifies whether the multicycle adjustment applies to setup/hold check.  The -setup parameter applies multicycles to setup check. The hold check is affected but the hold multiplier does not change.  The -hold parameter applies multicycles to hold check only.  Default: If you do not specify -setup or -hold parameter, the software considers the specified multicycle value for setup check and uses 0 for the hold check.  "\fB<number_of_cycles>\fR" Specifies the number of cycles allowed for the path.  "\fB-rise\fR" Applies the assertion at the rising edge of the signal on the path endpoints.  "\fB-start | -end\fR" Specifies whether the multicycle adjustment is to be applied relative to the starting clock edge for the path or relative to the ending clock edge for the path.  Use these options for multiple clocks designs. By default, the setup check is relative to the end clock and the hold check is relative to the start clock.  Note: The -start and -end parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  You can set the timing_enable_sdc_compatible_data_check_mcp global variable to true to enable checking for SDC compatible data checks. When the -start parameter is specified, the parameter reverses the reference clock by one clock cycle.  "\fB{-through | -rise_through | -fall_through} <through_list>\fR" Specifies the ports, pins, instances, or nets that the path goes through.  The pins can be on intermediate hierarchical boundaries. The <through_list> variable can contain either collection IDs or object names.  When used without the -from or -to option, all paths that go through the -through pins are multicycle paths. When used with both the -from and -to options, any path starting at any pin on the -from list and going through any point on the -through pin list and going to any point on the -to list is affected by the assertion.  You can use only one -from and -to option, but you can specify several -through options in the same command.  By default, the -through option applies the assertion to both the rising and the falling edges. Using the -rise_through option applies the assertion at the rising edge of the signal on the through pins. Using the -fall_through option applies the assertion at the falling edge of the signal on the through pins.  "\fB{-to| -rise_to | -fall_to} <to_list>\fR" Specifies the clocks, ports, pins, or sequential instances that are at the end of the multicycle paths.  The port direction can be either output or inout. Pins must be valid path end-points such as sequential instance data pins or pins on which output delays have been specified. Pins can be on intermediate hierarchical boundaries. The <to_list> variable can contain either collection IDs or object names.  If the -to option is used without the -from option, all paths ending in the -to pin list are multicycle paths. Use only one -to option per command.  Use only one -to, -rise_to, or -fall_to option per command.
