.SH Name \fBtiming_extract_model_consider_design_level_drv\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_extract_model_consider_design_level_drv\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default : true
.P Considers set_max_capacitance and set_max_transition DRV constraints, that have been applied on the current design during model extraction.
.P When set to true, these constraints applied at the design level will be considered during model extraction. However, the maximum capacitance and maximum transition from various DRV constraints applied/inferred on the ports is considered.
.P When set to false, the software extracts the worse-case DRV values and the constraints applied on the current design will be ignored.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
