.SH Name \fBset_power_include_file\fR \-  Specifies a PowerMeter include file
.SH Syntax \fBset_power_include_file\fR  <file>  [-reset] 
.P Specifies a PowerMeter include file. You can use the set_power_include_file command to specify certain commands of the dynamic engine which do not have an Voltus equivalent. For more information on the PowerMeter commands, refer to the "Advanced PowerMeter Options" chapter of the Voltus Text Command Reference.
.P Note: The set_power_include_file command is used to pass PowerMeter and report_power command options only in the dynamic mode (vectorbased and vectorless). If set_power_analysis_mode is set to static, the set_power_include_file command is ignored. 
.SH Parameters    "\fBfile\fR" Name of the include file. This is used when translating PowerMeter commands to Voltus IC Power Integrity Solution commands. This file will include all PowerMeter commands that can not be translated to Voltus commands. In addition, you can also include the report_power command options to generate different power reports.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all options back to default values.
