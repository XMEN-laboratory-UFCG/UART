.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each deleteBumps parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man deleteBumps  "\fB-all\fR" Deletes all bumps.  "\fB-bumps <bump+>\fR" Specifies the names of the bumps to be deleted. You can use wildcards in the bump name list.   "\fB-floating\fR" Deletes bumps which are not assigned to any nets.  "\fB-overlap_areaio\fR" Deletes bumps that overlap with the area I/O cells. You must first select the area I/O cells in the design display area, then use this command to delete the bumps.  "\fB-overlap_blockages\fR" Deletes all bumps that overlap routing blockages on the same layer. For example, if a bump on layer M7 overlaps a routing blockage on layer M7, the bump is deleted when you use this parameter.  "\fB-overlap_keepout\fR" Deletes specified bumps that overlap the bump keep out zone.   "\fB-overlap_macro\fR" Deletes all bumps that overlap the selected macros. You must first select the macros in the design display area, then use this command to delete the bumps.  "\fB-selected\fR" Deletes selected bumps. You must first select the bumps in the design display area, then use this command to delete the bumps.
