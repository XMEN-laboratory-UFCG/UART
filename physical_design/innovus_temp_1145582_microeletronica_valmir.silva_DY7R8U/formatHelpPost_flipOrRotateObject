.SH Name \fBflipOrRotateObject\fR \-  Flips or rotates the selected objects. Alternatively, you can use the "Flip/Rotate Selected Objects" form in the Innovus GUI, to flip or rotate an instance. Use this command after importing the design
.SH Syntax \fBflipOrRotateObject\fR   [-help]  [-keepRelative]  {-flip {MX | MY} | -rotate {R90 | R180 | R270}}   [-group]  [-name <object>]
.P Flips or rotates the selected objects. Alternatively, you can use the "Flip/Rotate Selected Objects" form in the Innovus GUI, to flip or rotate an instance. Use this command after importing the design. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-flip {MX | MY}\fR" Flips the selected object(s) through x axis or y axis.  Example: flipOrRotateObject -flip MX  Before:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: string, required  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each flipOrRotateObject parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man flipOrRotateObject  "\fB-group\fR" Flips or rotates the bounding box which encloses all the selected objects.  Example: flipOrRotateObject -flip MX -group  Before:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-keepRelative\fR" Calls the create_relative_floorplan command. With this option enabled, when the anchor objects are rotated, the relative objects are rotated and updated automatically.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-name <object>\fR" Specifies the name of the object you want to flip or rotate.  Note: The objects can be modules, groups, placement blockage, routing blockage, hard Macros, special routings, special wires, and special vias (including 45 degree).  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-rotate {R90|R180|R270}\fR" Rotates the selected object(s) by 90 or 180 or 270 degrees.  Data_type: string, required 
.SH Example
.P The following command flips the selected object(s) through the x axis:
.P flipOrRotateObject -flip MX
