.P Type: String
.P Default: ""
.P Specifies a prefix to be applied to all files 'auto-generated' by the tool. This includes report files or other output files with default names that are automatically created by some commands in the current run directory. So a default name like "cmd.report" will become "<prefix>cmd.report". Default names that have been overridden with a name chosen by the user, are not affected. This allows multiple simultaneous runs from the same run directory to direct default output files to different locations to avoid collisions.
