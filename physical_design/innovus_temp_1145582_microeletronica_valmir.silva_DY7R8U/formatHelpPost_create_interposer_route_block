.TH create_interposer_route_block  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreate_interposer_route_block\fR \-  Creates the master block
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_interposer_route_block\fR  [-help]   -box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}   -cell <cell_name>  -dir <dir_name>  -inst <master_name>
.P Creates the master block. It transforms the routed domain to a master partition block that enrolls all the special routes.
.P Note: If the design does not have a  routing pattern that can be treated as a master block, the functionality of the create_interposer_route_block command can be replaced by loading the LEF file of the master partition that has the same routing pattern using the loadLefFile command. After this, the add_interposer_route_block command can be used directly. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the master block's bounding box.  Note: The snapping grid of the created block honors the setFPlanMode -snapBlockGrid command settings.  Data_type: box, required  "\fB-cell <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the master cell name.  Data_type: string, required   "\fB-dir <dir_name>\fR" Specifies the directory name that will contain the partition information and files. The tool creates the directory and saves the information and files for the top and master block partition automatically after the create_interposer_route_block command is used.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each create_interposer_route_block parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man create_interposer_route_block  "\fB-inst <master_name>\fR" Specifies the master block name.  Note: The default orientation of the created master block is R0.  Data_type: string, required
