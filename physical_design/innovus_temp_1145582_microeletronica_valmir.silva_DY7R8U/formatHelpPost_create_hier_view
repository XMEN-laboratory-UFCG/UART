.P Creates a hierarchical power-grid view. The hierarchical PGV generation of a block is part of the top-level Hierarchical Rail Analysis. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-block_lef <lef_file>\fR" Specifies the name of the block LEF file. The <lef_file> must have all power pin port geometries defined for the hierarchical block.  "\fB-block_gds <gds_file>\fR" In absence of block LEF, you can specify block GDS and port label file to generate hierarchical power-grid view.  "\fB-cell_name <name>\fR" Specifies the block cell name as specified in the block DEF file.  "\fB-cluster_via1_ports {true | false}\fR" Designs with follow-pin routing on M1 and M2 layers have standard cells library LEF with M1, M2, and VIA1 ports. This parameter specifies to cluster VIA1 ports for such cells in order to improve overall extraction and rail analysis performance.  Default: true  This parameter is set to true by default to improve VIA1 port handling in designs with M1 and M2 follow-pin routing. This parameter gives significantly better performance by clustering equidistant VIA1 ports defined in cell LEF without significant loss of accuracy. However, if you specify a clustering rule, the user specification takes precedence over automated VIA1 clustering.  "\fB-cluster_via_rule { {<via_layer1> <number_of_equidistant_vias>}...}\fR" Controls the number of vias to cluster on a layer basis. The VIA clustering rule specified using this parameter will override the default clustering rule for a given accuracy mode.  The following command will cluster 100 equidistant VIA1 cuts, 200 equidistant VIA2 cuts, and 300 equidistant VIA7 cuts:  create_hier_view -cluster_via_rule { {VIA1 100}} {VIA2 200} {VIA7 300}}  The rest of the VIAs will be clustered using the default clustering rule depending upon the rail analysis accuracy mode.  "\fB-cluster_via_size <value>\fR" Specifies the size of the via array to cluster all via layers except VIA1 (layer between Metal1 and Metal2).  The default value is 625 (25x25 via array), except when running static analysis using HD mode. The default for static HD mode is 16 (4x4), primarily to preserve more accuracy for EM analysis.  Default: 625  "\fB-compress_powergrid_database {true | false}\fR" Specifies to compress the output files generated by extraction and rail analysis to save disk space usage. This parameter reduces disk space requirement from the extraction and rail analysis stages at approximately 5-10% performance penalty.  Default: false  "\fB-def <list_of_DEF_files>\fR" Specifies a list of block DEF files for hierarchical analysis.  "\fB-extraction_mode {fast | accurate}\fR" Determines what power-grid views will be created, dependent on whether fast or accurate extraction is to be done. By default, hierarchical PGV generates both detailed and reduced views.  "\fB-extraction_work_directory <path_to_extraction_work_directory>\fR" Specifies to re-use the extracted power-grid database to generate HPGV. This parameter is only supported to generate hierarchical extraction view of a block in the design.  The specified extraction work directory must contain the extracted data for all the nets for which the hierarchical extraction view needs to be generated.  This parameter is mutually exclusive with the -state_directories and -def parameters of the create_hier_view command.  "\fB-force_library_merging{true | false}\fR" Specifies to force merge PGVs with different resistivity and layers. It uses the technology information of the first library. If multiple tech-only PGVs are specified, it will take the first tech-only PGV definition and the first cell definition. If you are merging a tech-only PGV with other PGVs, it will keep the tech-only technology definition and the first cell definition.   "\fB-gds_port_file <gds_port_file>\fR" In absence of block LEF, you can specify block GDS and port label file to generate hierarchical power-grid view.  "\fB-ground_nets {<pin1><pin2><...pinN>} \fR" Specifies a list of ground nets of the block.  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each create_hier_view parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man create_hier_view.  "\fB-ignore_decaps {true | false}\fR" Ignores decap cells during rail analysis. It ignores cells that are tagged as DECAP cells during library characterization or set as decap cells using the set_rail_analysis_mode -decap_cell_list command parameter. If decaps are used to preserve connectivity on the follow-pin routing, you must set this parameter to false. Ignoring decaps during dynamic analysis is not recommended.  Default: true for static, false for dynamic  "\fB-ignore_fillers {true | false}\fR" Ignores filler cells during rail analysis if the list of filler cells are defined in PGV generation, or specified as fillers using the set_rail_analysis_mode -filler_cell_list command parameter. During rail analysis, ignore library cells that are tagged as FILLER cells and have no capacitance associated with the interface nodes. If fillers are used to preserve connectivity on the follow-pin routing, you must set this parameter to  false.   Default: true  "\fB-ignore_shorts {true | false}\fR" Ignores shorts that are found during extraction and continues hierarchical PGV generation. However, -ignore_shorts cannot be applied if the design contains GDS.  Default: false  "\fB-libgen_command_file <file>\fR" Specifies the file name of a power-grid library generation (libgen) command file. When specified, it will be included in the auto-generated libgen.cmd file at the end as include <file>. This parameter allows you to provide a file that includes specific library generation options.  "\fB-library_name <name>\fR" Specifies the name of the library that the block power-grid view will be placed in. A
.cl extension will automatically be added to the name.  "\fB-max_viacluster_mode {true | false}\fR" Specifies the extractor to cluster vias automatically to reduce the RC elements by clustering vias into one node, therefore reducing the IR drop analysis runtime in dynamic mode. It is based on the notion that current evenly distributes through all vias of an array via.  Default: true  "\fB-oaRef <OA_Reference_libs>\fR" Reads OpenAccess reference libraries.  "\fB-output_dir <dir>\fR" Specifies the output directory that the results will be save in.  "\fB-parasitic_extractor_command_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the file input to the extractor invoked by the Library Generation engine. This file contains information about the cells in the design and is used for resistance and capacitance extraction. For variables and functions that can be placed in this command file, see Extractor Options in Voltus Text Command Reference. In general, this parameter is used for debugging purposes.   "\fB-powergrid_view_libraries <primitive_cells.cl>\fR" Specifies a list of primitive cell libraries for hierarchical PGV generation.  "\fB-power_nets {<pin1><value1><pin2><value2
...pinN><valueN>} \fR" Specifies a list of power nets and the nominal voltage of those nets.

./pgv/stdcells.cl  -power_nets {vdd 1.2}  -ground_nets {gnd} -cell_name blockA  The design.lef must have all power pin port geometries defined for the hierarchical block. The generated hierarchical PGV library is blockA.cl. The library is in binary format and it stores the block's connectivity to the top-level based on the provided LEF data.
