.SH Name \fBcheck_library\fR \-  Checks the problematic cells that cause issues such as bad geometries for DRC and bad pin access for routing
.SH Syntax \fBcheck_library\fR   [-help]   [-place [-cell <cell_name>|-all_lib_cell][-legal_frequency ] [-file <fileName>] ]
.P Checks the problematic cells that cause issues such as bad geometries for DRC and bad pin access for routing. You can specify a library cell or a partition cell. It also performs checks for the multi-height cell legal frequency. The report is dumped into an output file. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-all_lib_cell\fR" Specifies to check all library cells.   "\fB-cell <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the cell to check.   "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each check_library parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man check_library.  "\fB-legal_frequency\fR" Specifies to check multi-height cell legal frequency   "\fB-place\fR" Specifies to do library checking for placement. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks the buf01 cell:
.RE
.P check_library -place -cell buf01
.P Estimated cell power/ground rail width = 0.021 um
.P *info: running library checker
...
.P *info: total 1 cell checked.
.P *reporting cell (buf01)
...
.P reporting cell drc : "legal"
.P reporting cell pin access : "legal"
.P reporting cell symmetry : cell (buf01) has lef symmetry X Y
.P reporting cell pin alignment : "legal"
.P reporting cell legal frequency
...   cell (buf01) legalization frequency: one legal location out of every 1.25 sites
