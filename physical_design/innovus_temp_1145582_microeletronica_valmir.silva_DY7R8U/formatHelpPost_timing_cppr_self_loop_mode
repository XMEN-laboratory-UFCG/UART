.SH Name \fBtiming_cppr_self_loop_mode\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_cppr_self_loop_mode\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: true
.P When set to true in case of self-loop paths, computes CPPR adjustment by taking the difference between early and late clock arrival time of the common point; the clock pin of the flop. A self-loop path is a path that goes from a clock pin of a flop and ends at the data pin of the same flop. However detecting self-loop paths requires runtime, and is design dependant.
.P When set to false, does not detect self-loop paths. In this case, the software computes CPPR adjustment by using the common point as the output pin driving the clock pin of the flop. This might result in better runtime, but less accurate results. The loss of accuracy is the difference between early and late delay of the interconnect portion driving the clock pin.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
