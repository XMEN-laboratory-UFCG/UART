.P Deletes placed tie cells from the netlist and reconnects the tie input pins back to 1'b1 and 1'b0. Use this command if there are existing tie cells in design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each deleteTieHiLo parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man deleteTieHiLo.   "\fB-cell <tieCellName>|<"listOfTieCellNames">  \fR" The <tieCellName> argument specifies the cell name to delete.  The " <listOfTieCellNames> " argument specifies the list of cell names to be deleted, which must be surrounded by quotation marks.  Note: The <tieCellName> and "<listOfTieCellNames>" arguments are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-prefix <prefixName>  \fR" Specifies the prefix of the instances to delete.
