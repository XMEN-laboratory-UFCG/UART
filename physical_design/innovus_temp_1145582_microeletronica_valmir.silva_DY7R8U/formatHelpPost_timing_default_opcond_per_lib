.TH timing_default_opcond_per_lib  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_default_opcond_per_lib\fR \-  Determines the default operating condition behavior when there is no explicit user operating condition specified through the setOpcond command
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_default_opcond_per_lib\fR  {true | false}  Default: true 
.P Determines the default operating condition behavior when there is no explicit user operating condition specified through the setOpcond command. 
.P When set to true, each timing library uses its own internally-defined default operating condition specification. 
.P When set to false, the default operating condition of the master library (that is, the first library in the library search list) is used to set the PVT operation point for the entire design. All timing libraries are accessed and derated to that operating point.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
