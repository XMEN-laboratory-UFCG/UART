.SH Name \fBall_fanout\fR \-  Returns a collection of pins, ports, or cells that exist in the fanout cone of the specified objects
.SH Syntax \fBall_fanout\fR  [-help]  [-endpoints_only]  [-hpin]   [-only_cells]  [-trace_through {case_disable | user_disable | all | clocks | loop_snipped}]   [-view <view_name>]  [-levels <value> | -pin_levels <value>]  {-from {collection | <object_list>} }  [ > | >> ] 
.P Returns a collection of pins, ports, or cells that exist in the fanout cone of the specified objects. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-endpoints_only\fR" Returns a collection only of valid end points in the fanout zone.  "\fB-hpin\fR" Returns hierarchical pins along with the flat pins.  "\fB> | >> \fR" Stores the generated collection in the specified file.  You can add the
.gz extension to the file name to generate a compressed report.  Note: The file name must be the last parameter specified.  "\fB-from {<collection> | <object_list>}\fR" Specifies the objects for which to return the collection. You can specify a list of objects, or a collection of objects.  "\fB-levels <value>\fR" Specifies the number of gate levels to go forward from a specific pin object to create the collection.  "\fB-only_cells\fR" Returns a collection only of the cells in the fanout zone.  "\fB-pin_levels <value>\fR" Specifies the number delay arcs to go forward from a specific pin object to create the collection.  "\fB-trace_through {case_disable |user_disable | all | clocks | loop_snipped}\fR" Allows traversal through disabled arcs. You can specify one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 case_disable: Arcs which are disabled using the set_case_analysis command and through physical constant are traversed. The arcs disabled using set_disable_timing are not traversed.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 user_disable: Arcs disabled using set_disable_timing command are traversed but those disabled using set_case_analysis command are not traversed.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 all: Enables trace through all arcs  "*" 2 clocks: Allows traversal through pins for which clock constraints (such as, create_clock, create_generated_clock) are applied. The pins that are disabled using the set_case_analysis and set_disable_timing commands are not traversed.  "*" 2 loop_snipped: Allows trace through the loop snipped arcs.
.RE   "\fB-view <view_name>\fR" Specifies the view name for which fan cone traversal is to be performed. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command returns the collection of cells in the fanout zone of the input port IN1:  all_fanout -from IN1 -only_cells  "*" 2 The following command returns all the valid endpoints (sequential elements and/oroutput ports) in the fanout zone of IN1, allowing the traversal through arcs disabled by set_case_analysis and set_disable_timing:  all_fanout -from IN1 -endpoints_only -trace_through all
