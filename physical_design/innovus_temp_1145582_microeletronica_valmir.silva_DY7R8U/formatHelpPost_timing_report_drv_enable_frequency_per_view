.SH Name \fBtiming_report_drv_enable_frequency_per_view\fR
.SH Syntax 
.P timing_report_drv_enable_frequency_per_view  {true | false}
.P Default : false
.P Enables view-based frequency DRV flow.
.P When set to true, in the MMMC DRV flow, the software performs frequency computation for design pins as per the clock period of specific analysis views reaching a pin. In case of non-activity based flow, the frequency is computed as per the fastest clock of all the views.
.P When set to false, in the propagate activity flow, the software performs frequency computation for design pins from propagated activity on that pin.
.P For other flows. the software performs frequency computation for design pins as per the smallest clock period (largest clock frequency) from all the active analysis views. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
