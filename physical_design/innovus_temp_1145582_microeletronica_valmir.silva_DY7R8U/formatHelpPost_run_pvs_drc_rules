.P Calls the Cadence Physical Verification System application to check DRC rules with a sign-off PVS rule deck. 
.P This command is loaded only if you have a PVS installation and the PVS bin directory is in your Linux search path (e.g. the command pvs can be run).
.P It is possible there are different options than described here depending on the version of PVS that you have installed. Use run_pvs_drc_rules -help to view the exact command syntax for your current PVS installation.
.P run_pvs_drc_rules will assemble the necessary files, call pvs, and then read back the PVS violations so they are visible in the Innovus violation browser. The call to pvs requires the appropriate PVS licenses in order to run.
.P The run_pvs_drc_rules command takes as input:
.RS  "*" 2 A GDSII/OASIS layout file (normally created by streamOut command in Innovus)  "*" 2 A layer map file  "*" 2 A PVL rule file that contains the DRC rules to check  "*" 2 The name of the output PVS results database file to be created  "*" 2  Other optional arguments, such as distributed processing, area to check, number of errors to output, and so on. 
.RE
.P Details about the various file formats can be found in the PVS documentation.
.P This command returns a status of 0 (tcl_OK) or 1 (tcl_ERROR). Error messages or warnings are written to the Innovus log file. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB<pvlFile>\fR" Specifies the PVS rule file.   "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Defines the area to be checked. The default is the entire chip window.   "\fB-dp <N>\fR" Specifies the number of local cores to use. The default is 1.   "\fB-error <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of errors to output. The default is 1000000.   "\fB-gds_file <fileName>\fR" Specifies a GDSII file to be read by PVS. If this parameter is specified, then the -mapfile parameter is ignored and streamOut is not run.  "\fB-mapfile fileName\fR" Specifies a stream map file. In the usual case, the Innovus map file used by the Innovus streamOut command is specified. If this parameter is specified and neither of the parameters -gds_file or -oasis_file is specified, then the streamOut command is automatically run before PVS starts. The streamOut command is:   streamOut 
.pvs_xxx/<topcell>.gds.gz  -mapFile <mapfile> -libName designLib -outputMacro -mode ALL [-units <integer>]  Here, <topcell> is the topcell name of the design and <mapfile> is the file name specified with the -mapfile parameter. The optional -units <integer> is taken from the run_pvs_drc_rules -units value (if given). If not given, Innovus streamOut uses the Innovus DB unit value. Refer to the Innovus streamOut command for more details.  For information on the map file format, see "About the GDSII or OASIS Map File" in the Importing and Exporting Designs chapter of the Innovus User Guide.  Note: The -mapfile parameter is currently mandatory, even if it is not used due to the presence of -gds_file or -oasis_file. It will become optional in future release.  "\fB-merge <list_files>\fR" Specifies the list of external stream files for streamOut.   "\fB-noclean\fR" Specifies that the working directory, which is created while the run_pvs_drc_rules command is running, should not be removed after the run. The working directory name begins with 
.pvs.    "\fB-oa_view <view_name>\fR" Specifies the temporary OA view.   "\fB-oasis_file <fileName>\fR" Specifies an Oasis file to be read by PVS. If this parameter is specified, then the -mapfile parameter is ignored and  streamOut is not run.   "\fB-output <fileName>\fR" Specifies the error markers result database in ASCII format. If not specified, <topCellName>.ascii is used.   "\fB-repRoutingOnly\fR" Ignores standard cell violations. This parameter is equivalent to setting "abort_on_layout_error no" in PVS rule deck. abort_on_layout_error checks for problems such as missing cell masters and duplicate cell references. If -repRoutingOnly is specified, PVS does not abort even if any of these errors happen.    For more information, refer to the Cadence Physical Verification System Developer Guide.  "\fB-report <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the PVS DRC summary report file to be created. When a relative path has been specified, the report file is created relative to the Innovus invocation directory. The default is no report file.   "\fB-stream_out\fR" Uses the streamOut command for GDS in the OA flow.   "\fB-units <integer>\fR" Specifies the user-defined DB unit value used for streamOut (see -mapfile above). This value should be consistent with the DB unit value in PVL rules.  "\fB-version\fR" Prints the PVS version.   "\fB-work_directory <working_directory>\fR" Specifies the current working directory. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command runs sign-off DRC check with the gds file from Innovus using the PVS rule file 28nm.pvl. The gds file will be streamed out with the specified map file, gds.map, and the gds unit will be 1000 as specified:  run_pvs_drc_rules 28nm.pvl -mapfile gds.map -units 1000  "*" 2  The following command runs sign-off DRC check on routing layers within the specified area {0 0 100 100} using 8 local CPUs. The command will report only up to 1000 DRC issues:  run_pvs_drc_rules 28nm.pvl -area {0 0 100 100} -dp 8 -error 1000 -mapfile gds.map  "*" 2  The following command runs sign-off check on the existing gds file ios.gds, and writes the report file to pvs.signoff.db:   run_pvs_drc_rules 28nm.pvl -report pvs.signoff.db -gds_file ios.gds
