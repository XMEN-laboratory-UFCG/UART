.SH Name \fBassignSigToBump\fR \-  Assigns selected or specified bumps to the specified net or pin
.SH Syntax \fBassignSigToBump\fR  [-help]   { {{-net <net_name> | {-top_pin <port> [-bump_pin <bump_pin_name>]}} {-bumps <bump_name_list> | -selected}} } 
.P Assigns selected or specified bumps to the specified net or pin. The command supports signal, power, as well as ground nets. Feedthrough bumps with multiple pins are also supported. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each assignSigToBump parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man assignSigToBump  "\fB-bump_pin <bump_pin_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the bump pin that has to be assigned to the specified top pin. Use this option for feedthrough bumps, which have multiple pins.  This parameter can be used only with the -top_pin parameter.  "\fB-bumps <bump_name_list>\fR" Specifies the bumps to be assigned to the net specified with -net. Use braces to enclose the bump names.  "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the signal or PG net to which bumps are to be assigned.  "\fB-selected\fR" Assigns the selected bumps to the specified net.  "\fB-top_pin <port>\fR" Specifies the name of the top-level pin to which bumps are to be assigned. After assignment, the pin name of the bump is the top-level pin name and the net name of the bump is the net name of the specified pin.  This parameter cannot be used with the -net parameter. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command assigns bump_1 and bump_2 to the signal net sig[1]:  assignSigToBump -net sig[1] -bumps {bump_1 bump_2}  "*" 2  The following command assigns bump_1 to the power net VDD:  assignSigToBump -net VDD -bumps bump_1  "*" 2  The following command assigns the selected bumps to the ground net VSS:  assignSigToBump -net VSS -selected  "*" 2  The following command assigns the PIN_1 pin of the bump1 feedthrough bump to the top-level pin, CLK_IN:  assignSigToBump -bumps bump1 -top_pin CLK_IN [-bump_pin PIN_1]
