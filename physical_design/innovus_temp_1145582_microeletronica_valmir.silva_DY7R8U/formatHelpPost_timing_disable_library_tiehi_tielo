.SH Name \fBtiming_disable_library_tiehi_tielo\fR \-  Disables constant functions in a library
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_disable_library_tiehi_tielo\fR  {true | false}   Default: false 
.P Disables constant functions in a library. 
.P When set to false, the software considers constant propagation from library tie high/low cells prior to those from logical netlist and constraints. There may be cases where programmable tie cells are used whose value can be changed later in the flow, assuming the programmable tie cells are modelled with constant output functions. 
.P When set to true, the library constants are not propagated during timing analysis or timing optimization. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
