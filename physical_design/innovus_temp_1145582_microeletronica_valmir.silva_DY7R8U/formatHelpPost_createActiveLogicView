.SH Name \fBcreateActiveLogicView\fR \-  Trims the timing graph to ignore logic inside the first level registers in partitions to improve runtime for timing-related commands
.SH Syntax \fBcreateActiveLogicView\fR  [help]  [-type {flatTop timingBudget topIO}[-setDontTouch | -unsetDontTouch ]] 
.P Trims the timing graph to ignore logic inside the first level registers in partitions to improve runtime for timing-related commands. This capability should only be used for timing analysis purpose. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each createActiveLogicView parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man createActiveLogicView.  "\fB-setDontTouch\fR" Sets the dontTouch value as true. This freezes I/O interfaces (Interface logics and interface nets) and prevents the  optDesign -postCTS -hold from optimizing the block interface logics. The ILM ECO data can be loaded back.   "\fB-type {flatTop timingBudget topIO}\fR" Specifies the Active Logic View type.
.RS  "*" 2 flatTop: Used to mark the top-level timing graph to mask all logic inside the interface logic of each partition.  "*" 2 timingBudget: Instructs the command to use tuned settings for deriveTimingBudget when marking the top-level timing graph.  This option should be specified if you plan to run timeDesign or optVirtual with ART based and later on run deriveTimingBudget based on the resulted timing graph.  "*" 2 topIO: Marks interface nets/instances to don't touch, so optimizer will preserve the I/O paths during optimization. Value of -topIO is -setDontTouch or -unsetDontTouch.
.RE   "\fB-unsetDontTouch\fR" Sets dontTouch value as false. This resets the dontTouch on I/O logics before reading the ECO data.
