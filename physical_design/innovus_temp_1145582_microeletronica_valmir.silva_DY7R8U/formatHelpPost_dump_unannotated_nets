.SH Name \fBdump_unannotated_nets\fR \-  Shows the percentage of nets annotated by a specific type and also prints the names of all nets that are not annotated by that type
.SH Syntax  \fBdump_unannotated_nets\fR   [-help]  [-file <filename>]   -type <annotationType> 
.P Shows the percentage of nets annotated by a specific type and also prints the names of all nets that are not annotated by that type.
.P Annotation information is stored on a per-file basis for activity, VCD, TCF, and user commands to provide detailed annotation reports when requested.
.P dump_unannotated_nets can be invoked multiple times with different report types (-type). You must specify this command before report_power. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-file<filename>\fR" Specifies the text file name that includes the annotation report information. If no file is specified, the report will be written to the default output file annotation_<type>.log, where <type> is taken from the -type argument specified.  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.  "\fB-type<annotationType>\fR" The type can be any of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 all  Shows annotation reports for all types.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 activity  Shows annotation data for all types of activity specifications including TCF, VCD, SDC, TWF, and user commands that set activity.  "*" 2 cap  Shows annotations from the SPEF files.  "*" 2 fsdb  Shows annotations from the FSDB files.  "*" 2 saif  Shows annotations from the SAIF files.  "*" 2 tcf  Shows annotations from the TCF files.  "*" 2 timing  Shows annotations from the TWF files. This type is applicable only to the dynamic power analysis flow.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 vcd  Shows annotation from the VCD files.
.RE 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command dumps the nets in the netlist that are missing in the vcd file:   dump_unannotated_nets -type vcd -file vcd.log   The net names are written in the file vcd.log.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command dumps the nets in the netlist which do not have an activity annotated from any source (VCD/TCF/SDC/TWF/user defined) and writes the net names in the file unannotatednets.log:   dump_unannotated_nets -type all -file unannotatednets.log
