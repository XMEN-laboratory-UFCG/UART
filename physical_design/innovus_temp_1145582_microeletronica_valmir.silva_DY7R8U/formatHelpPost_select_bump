.SH Name \fBselect_bump\fR \-  Enables you to select bumps in different ways
.SH Syntax \fBselect_bump\fR  [-help]  [-alternate {row column}]  [-area {{x1 y1 x2 y2}
...}]  [-assigned]  [-bump_cell {<cell_list>}]  [-bumps {<bump_list>}]  [-floating]   [-max_distance_to_side <distance>]   [-nets {<net_list>}]  [-side {top bottom left right}]   [-start_lower_left]  [-type {signal power ground}] 
.P Enables you to select bumps in different ways. For example, you can select bumps by type or by net. By default, selects all bumps in the design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each select_bump parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man select_bump  "\fB-alternate {row column}\fR" Specifies the alternate bump pattern. You have to preselect the area in which the bumps are to be alternate-selected before using this option.   "\fB-area {{<x1 y1 x2 y2>}
...}\fR" Specifies one or more areas from which bumps are to be selected.   "\fB-assigned\fR" Selects only the bumps that are assigned.   "\fB-bump_cell {<cell_list>}\fR" Specifies names of bump cells and the bumps with these bump cells are selected. You can use wildcards in the bump cell list.   "\fB-bumps {<bump_list>}\fR" Specifies names of the bumps to be selected. You can use wildcards in the bump list.   "\fB-floating\fR" Selects only unassigned or floating bumps.   "\fB-max_distance_to_side <distance>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance away from the side in microns. When specified, only the bumps with geometries completely in that region are selected.  By default, half the width/height of the die is used as the maximum distance to each side.  For <distance>, minimum value is 0 and maximum is 1e+20.  "\fB-nets {<net_list>}\fR" Specifies names of nets and the related bumps are selected. You can use wildcards in the net list.   "\fB-side {top bottom left right}\fR" Specifies the side relative to which bumps are selected.   "\fB-start_lower_left\fR" Specifies the start point of alternate selection. If it is not specified, the lower-left point is considered the start point of alternate deselection.  Note: This parameter can only be used with -alternate.  "\fB-type {signal power ground}\fR" Specifies the type of bumps to be selected. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command selects all bumps in the design:  select_bump   "*" 2 The following command selects the bottom edge of bump geometry no more than 500 microns away from the top side:  select_bump -side top -max_distance_to_side  500  "*" 2 After selecting all the bumps in a design or in a specific area, use the following command to alternately select a 2x3 bump pattern starting from the lower left corner:  select_bump -alternate {2 3} -start_lower_left  The resulting selection pattern is shown below.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command selects four bumps, bump_1, bump_2, bump_4, and bump_5, as shown below:  select_bump -area {0 0 100 100}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command selects two bumps, bump_1 and bump_2, as shown below. Note that although the specified area touches the bump bounding box (bump bbox), there is no overlap:  select_bump -area {0 0 100 70}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
