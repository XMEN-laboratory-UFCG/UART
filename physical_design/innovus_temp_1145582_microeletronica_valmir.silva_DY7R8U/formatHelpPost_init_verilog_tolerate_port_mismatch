.TH init_verilog_tolerate_port_mismatch  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBinit_verilog_tolerate_port_mismatch\fR
.SH Syntax \fBinit_verilog_tolerate_port_mismatch\fR <value> 
.P Type: Integer
.P Default: 0
.P Specifies whether new instance ports can be created during Verilog netlist parsing.
.P By default, this variable is set to 0. If the ports of the cell and its instantiated instance do not match, the Verilog parser stops processing and the tool errors out. If instead, you would like the tool to continue, set the init_verilog_tolerate_port_mismatch variable to 1. When the variable value is set to 1, the Verilog parser ignores the mismatch and adds the new port to the cell. This is intended to be used during prototyping when it may be alright to lose some connections in 'dirty netlists'. Warnings about mismatches will still be generated.
.P Set this variable before the Verliog file is read in.
