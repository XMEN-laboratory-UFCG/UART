.SH Name \fBverify_stacked_die\fR \-  Checks die edge violation between adjacent dies
.SH Syntax \fBverify_stacked_die\fR  [-help]  [-check_type <type_name>]  [-chip_name {<chip1> <chip2>
...}] 
.P Checks die edge violation between adjacent dies. Once you define an OBS layer inside a macro, the adjacent die edge should not overlap this OBS area. If there is any violation between macro OBS and adjacent die edge, it will be marked in the GUI window.
.P This command must be used after readDieAbstract to input adjacent die's die abstract file. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description of the verify_stacked_die command usage.  For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man verify_stacked_die  "\fB-check_type <type_name>\fR" Specifies the check constrain types. Currently, only the die_edge and bump_keepout zone checking are supported.  "\fB-chip_name {<chip1> <chip2>
...}\fR" Specifies the name of the adjacent chip whose edge is to be checked for violation. In a 3D-IC design, there could be more than one top die (in interposer design), so you can specify the chip that needs to be checked. Using this parameter, you can check one or more chips at the same time. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks die edge violation between the macro's keep-out area and adjacent die mother_die:  verify_stacked_die -chip_name {mother_die}
