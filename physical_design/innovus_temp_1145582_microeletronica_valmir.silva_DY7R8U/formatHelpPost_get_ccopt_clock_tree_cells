.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_clock_tree_cells\fR \-  This command returns a list of clock tree cells - cell instances that form a part of the clock tree network - whose names match the specified pattern
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_clock_tree_cells\fR  [-help]  <pattern>   [-in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>]  [-net_types leaf | trunk | top]  [-node_types buffer | inverter | clock_gate | logic | source | generator | all]  [-not_in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>]   [-regexp] 
.P This command returns a list of clock tree cells - cell instances that form a part of the clock tree network - whose names match the specified pattern. By default, the command returns all clock tree cells with matching names, but you can use optional parameters to filter the list based on cell type and clock tree membership. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_ccopt_clock_tree_cells parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man get_ccopt_clock_tree_cells.  "\fB-in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>          \fR" Specifies a Tcl list of clock trees whose cells are to be included in the list. If not specified, all the cells of all the clock trees in the design that satisfy the other conditions of the command will be returned.   "\fB-net_types leaf | trunk | top\fR" Only returns nodes driving nets of the specified type(s). All clock tree nets fall into one of three categories:
.RS  "*" 2 leaf nets - nets connected to sinks  "*" 2 top nets - nets with a high transitive fanout, exceeding the threshold specified using the set_ccopt_property routing_top_min_fanout CCOpt property  "*" 2 trunk nets - all other nets in the clock tree that are neither leaf nor top nets
.RE   By default, all net types are returned: leaf, top, and trunk.  "\fB-node_types buffer | inverter | clock_gate | logic | source | generator | all\fR" Specifies the type of cells returned by the command. If not specified, all types of cells that satisfy the other conditions of the command will be returned. Valid values for <type> are: "buffer", "clock_gate", "inverter", "logic", "source", "generator", and "all".   "\fB-not_in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>\fR" Specifies a Tcl list of clock tree whose cells are to be excluded from the list. If not specified, all the cells that satisfy the other conditions of the command will be returned.   "\fB<pattern>\fR" Returns clock tree cells that match this pattern. If not specified, all the clock tree cells that satisfy the other conditions of the command will be returned.  Note: The wildcard pattern, (*) matches zero or more characters. You can also use the question mark (?), which matches exactly one character.  "\fB-regexp\fR" When specified, treats all patterns as full Tcl regular expressions. If not specified, pattern is treated as a wildcard pattern.
