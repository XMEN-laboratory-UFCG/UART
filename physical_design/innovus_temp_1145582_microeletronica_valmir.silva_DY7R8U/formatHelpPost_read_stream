.TH read_stream  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBread_stream\fR \-  Reads in-stream files or a layer map and outputs a summary of the cell names read in, and any layer/data types that have data with no map_file entry. The data is automatically scaled during reading to the correct DB units based on the stream units
.SH Syntax \fBread_stream\fR  [-help]   -layer_map <layer_map_files>   {[-pvs_fill ] | [[<in_files>] [-cells <cell_list> [-offset {x y}]]]}  
.P Reads in-stream files or a layer map and outputs a summary of the cell names read in, and any layer/data types that have data with no map_file entry. The data is automatically scaled during reading to the correct DB units based on the stream units.
.RS  "*" 2 It reads in the metal fill stream data (with top cell name and offset) to overlay on the design. The fill data is displayed to database fill shapes (equivalent to reading DEF FILL data) to allow editing or changing the fill data.  Reading in fill data is done once per session.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 It reads in-stream cells that have the same names as Innovus cell names to display the stream cell data (for example, overlay or toggle between stream shapes and LEF shapes for the cells).   If a stream cell name is repeated, it replaces any previous data for that cell.
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each read_stream parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man read_stream.  "\fB-cells <cell_list>\fR" Reads only the specified cells from GDS files.   "\fB<in_files>\fR" Lists GDS and OASIS files.   "\fB-layer_map <layer_map_files>\fR" Specifies the layer map file to map GDS layer to design layer   "\fB-offset <x> <y>\fR" Specifies, in microns, the offset for the top-level fill cell.   "\fB-pvs_fill\fR" Specifies to process the PVS FILL data in the read process.
.P Layer Map File Format
.P The -layer_map file maps stream layer/dtype data to Innovus layer and objects. Stream data does not have net ids, so you can only map stream data for display, or to fill, fill_opc or fill_blockage shapes.
.P The format for the layer map file is one line for each stream layer and dtype:
.P <layer data_type layer_name object_type>
.P Where
.RS  "*" 2 layer is an stream layer number. It is an integer.  "*" 2 data_type is a stream data_type number. It must be either an integer, or a range (e.g. 0-255).  "*" 2 layer_name is normally must be a LEF (or OA tech) layer name. It can only be a custom layer name if the obj_type is display (e.g. this data is not on any of the LEF layers, but is useful for display purposes). Any custom layer data will be displayed like data created with add_gui_shape or add_gui_text. The layer_name is case-sensitive.  "*" 2 object_type is one of these keywords:
.RS  "*" 2 fill: Equivalent to DEF FILL shapes  "*" 2 fill_opc: Equivalent to DEF FILL with + OPC shapes  "*" 2 fill_blockage: Equivalent to DEF BLOCKAGE + FILLS shapes  "*" 2 display: Is only for display purposes, and cannot be flattened.
.RE fill, fill_opc, and display can optionally be followed by   :mask:<mask_num>  where mask_num is the mask number for the shape for a multi-mask layer (equivalent of DEF + MASK <mask_num> for a shape).  fill_blockage can optionally be followed by  :name:<blockage_name>  where< blockage_name> is the name given to all the blockages from this layer/dtype.  Any text on the same layer/data_type will be mapped to the same DB layer as a text object on that layer. About the TEXT font and size, font 0 could be default (or other font decided by RD). Size could use the original size in GDS and scale it if dbu mismatch to Innovus.  The object_type keywords are case insensitive. The tool ignores blank lines or lines beginning with #.  A given layer/dtype combination can only appear once.
