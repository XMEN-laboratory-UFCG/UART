.SH Name \fBaddIoFiller\fR \-  Adds I/O instances in the I/O box
.SH Syntax \fBaddIoFiller\fR   [-help]  -cell {<name_list>}  [-fillAnyGap]  [-fillerOrient R0 | R90 | R180 | R270 | MX | MX90 | MY | MY90]  [-from <coord>]   [-prefix <prefix>]  [-side {top | bottom | left | right}]   [-to <coord>]   [-row <rowNumber>]   [-useSmallIoHeight]  [-logic [-deriveConnectivity]]  
.P Adds I/O instances in the I/O box. The I/O instances are added between the gap of existing I/O pad instances where the gap is large enough for the I/O instance. Use this command during or after floorplanning.
.P Note: Before using addIoFiller, run the globalNetConnect command to provide global-net-connection rules for supply pins of the added fillers. Without these rules, the built-in design-rule checks of addIoFiller will not be accurate. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each addIoFiller parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man addIoFiller  "\fB-cell {<name_list>}\fR" Specifies the name list of the I/O filler cells to be added.  Data_type: list, required  "\fB-deriveConnectivity\fR" Derives connectivity for I/O fillers.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-fillAnyGap\fR" Forces the I/O filler instance into a gap even though the gap (clearance) is not large enough.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, it does not force a filler instance.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-fillerOrient R0 | R90 | R180 | R270 | MX | MX90 | MY | MY90\fR" Specifies the orientation value of the filler cell. The orientation value can be R0, R90, R180, R270, MX, MX90, MY, or MY90.  Default: R0  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-from <coord>\fR" Specifies the starting offset from the edge for adding fillers. The values are in micrometers.  Note: The -from and -to parameters are intended to be used with the -side parameter to indicate a range. This command is applicable to peripheral I/O only; therefore, it is only one dimensional.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-logic\fR" Enables the creation of I/O filler instances for non-physical I/O cells. The added IO fillers are not marked as physical only cells. They are saved in netlist if user does saveNetlist.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-prefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies the prefix name for the new I/O filler instances.  Default: FILLER  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-row <rowNumber>\fR" Specifies the row number for inserting fillers in a multiple I/O row design.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 1  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-side {top | bottom | left | right}\fR" Specifies the side as top side, bottom side, left side, and right side of the I/O box.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, all sides are specified.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-to <coord>\fR" Specifies the ending offset from the edge for adding fillers. The values are in micrometers.  Note: The -from and -to parameters are intended to be used with the -side parameter to indicate a range. This command is applicable to peripheral I/O only; therefore, it is only one dimensional.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-useSmallIoHeight\fR" Specifies that the filler cell should be inserted between I/O pads only when the smallest I/O pad has the same height as the height of the filler cell. For example, consider that there are I/O pads A, B, C, D, and E. Out of these, A, B, and E are the same height, and C and D have a height double that of A, B, and E. Assume that you want to insert an I/O filler cell F, which has the same height as A, B, and E.  If you do not specify the -useSmallIoHeight parameter, the cell F will be inserted between A and B, B and C, C and D, and D and E. However, if you specify the -useSmallIoHeight parameter, the cell F will be inserted between A and B, B and C, and D and E. The cell will not be inserted between C and D, because both C and D have a height different from F.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds I/O instances to the I/O pad area on all sides wherever there is space between existing I/O pads. The added I/O pad filler instance names have a prefix PAD8.   addIoFiller -cell PAD8 -prefix PAD8
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds I/O instances to the I/O pad area on the top side from 200 micrometers. The added I/O pad filler instance names have a prefix PAD8.   addIoFiller -cell PAD8 -prefix PAD8 -side top -from 200
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds I/O instances to the I/O pad area on the left side to 300 micrometers. The added I/O pad filler instance names have a prefix PAD8.   addIoFiller -cell PAD8 -prefix PAD8 -side left -to 300
