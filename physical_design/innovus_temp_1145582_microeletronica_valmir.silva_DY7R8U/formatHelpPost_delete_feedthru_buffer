.SH Name \fBdelete_feedthru_buffer\fR \-  Removes the feedthrough buffer specified in the -bufInst option
.SH Syntax \fBdelete_feedthru_buffer\fR   [-help]   [-dontDelDanglingPort]   [-non_preferred_keep_nets <netNamePattern>]  [-preferred_keep_nets <netNamePattern>]  {{-bufInst <bufInstName>} | {-instPrefix instPrefixName} 
.P Removes the feedthrough buffer specified in the -bufInst option. It also removes all possible dangling hterms/hnets that are associated with the buffer removed. The delete_feedthru_buffer command supports multiple-instantiated buffer cells. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each delete_feedthru_buffer parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man delete_feedthru_buffer  "\fB-bufInst bufInstName\fR" Specifies the name of the feedthrough buffer to be removed.   "\fB-dontDelDanglingPort\fR" Is used if you do not want to remove the dangling ports created by this command.   "\fB-instPrefix instPrefixName\fR" Specifies the prefix name for the feedthrough buffer. It removes all buffer instances that were created by the insertPtnFeedthrough command if  insertPtnFeedthrough also used this option to specify the exactly same instPrefixName. Therefore, you need to specify exactly the same instance name prefix in the -instPrefix option of both the commands.  Note: The -instPrefix specified here must be unique to all instance names in the current design.  "\fB-non_preferred_keep_nets <netNamePattern>\fR" Specifies the non-preferred keep net name pattern. The nets whose names match the pattern will not be used by buffer deletion.   "\fB-preferred_keep_nets <netNamePattern>\fR" Specifies the preferred keep net name pattern. The nets whose names match the pattern will be used by buffer deletion. 
.SH Example
.P The following command deletes feedthrough buffer i1/i2/FE_FEED_BUF_1, and also keeps the dangling ports:  delete_feedthru_buffer -bufInst i1/i2/FE_FEED_BUF_1 -dontDelDanglingPort
