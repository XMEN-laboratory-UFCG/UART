.P This command offers a semi-automated mechanism that helps in trimming the redundant PG stripes and vias using an existing power grid pattern based on IR drop analysis reports. The command eliminates the need to manually adjust the power structure to reduce the power grid pessimism for area, timing, or power improvement in a design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each trim_pg parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man trim_pg  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Defines the area in which stripes and vias are to be trimmed. The stripes overlapped with the box defined by -area are trimmed.  Default: entire core area  "\fB-candidate_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the candidate filename.   "\fB-exclude {{<lx1 ly1 ux1 uy1>} {<lx2 ly2 ux2 uy2>}...}\fR" Excludes the box areas for the stripes and vias in which the part of stripes need not to be trimmed. This parameter is used along with the -area parameter to specify the exclusion areas. If a stripe partially overlaps with the exclusion area, the overlapping segment of the stripe is not trimmed. The exclusion box can partially overlap the  -area box.   "\fB-exclude_local_grid {{<lx1 ly1 ux1 uy1>} {<lx2 ly2 ux2 uy2>}...}\fR" Excludes the areas in which the whole stripes are skipped for trimming. If a stripe is completely inside one of the -exclude_local_grid box (can touch the boundary), it is excluded from the trim candidates and is not counted when applying the trim pattern. It is useful when trimming is done on a large area but there are local stripes in this area, which could affect the global trim pattern. The exclusion box can partially overlap the  -area box.   "\fB-keep_dangling_via\fR" Keeps the dangling vias while trimming stripes. By default, dangling vias are removed.   "\fB-layer {<layer_name1> [<layer_name2>]}\fR" Specifies the metal layer names for stripe and via trimming. While trimming a stripe, specify <layer_name1> on which the stripes are to be trimmed. While trimming via, specify <layer_name2>between which the stack vias are to be trimmed. The first layer is used as the reference while applying the via trim pattern.   "\fB-net {<list_of_nets>}\fR" Specifies the list of power or ground nets to be trimmed. The following figure presents area trimmed by the -net parameter:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-pattern {<str1> [<str2>
... <strN>]}\fR" Specifies the trimming pattern. While trimming a stripe, specify <str1>. The string is a sequence of 0 and 1 to indicate whether to trim or keep a stripe. While trimming a via, <str1> and multiple strings (if needed) define a multidimensional trim pattern. Each string is a sequence of 0 and 1 to indicate whether to trim or keep a stack via along the corresponding stripe on the reference layer. The reference layer is the first layer in the  -layer parameter.   "\fB-threshold <threshold_value>\fR" Specifies the threshold value for stripe merging. The stripes with center-line spacing smaller than or equal to the threshold value are considered for trimming.  Default: 0  "\fB-type {stripe | via}\fR" Specifies the type of trimming, which is either on the stripe of a layer or the stack via between two layers. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command trims 50% of the VDD stripes on a M6 metal layer inside a {0 0 500 500} box:  trim_pg -net VDD -type stripe -layer M6 -area {0 0 500 500} -pattern 10  "*" 2 The following command trims a via (stack) along with half of the M9 VDD stripes, and one-third of its stack vias between the M9 and M6 metal layers:  trim_pg -net VDD -type via -layer {M9 M6} -area {0 0 500 500} -pattern {110 1}
