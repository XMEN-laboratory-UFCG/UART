.SH Name \fBset_net_group\fR \-  Specifies the list of either power or ground nets that are isolated but need to be analyzed together as a single net
.SH Syntax  \fBset_net_group\fR  [-help]   -reset | {-name <group_name>  -type [power | ground]  -nets {<net_list>}   } 
.P Specifies the list of either power or ground nets that are isolated but need to be analyzed together as a single net. The results are generated for the new grouped net. The new grouped net name must be one of the net names in the group. To analyze the grouped net, you must also specify power pads for the grouped net name. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each set_net_group parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man set_net_group.  "\fB-name <group_name>\fR" Name of the net group.  Note: The name of the net group must be one of the net names in the group. Using a net name that is not in the net group will trigger error when displaying results in the flow.  "\fB-nets {<net_list>}\fR" Specifies a list of power or ground nets.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all previously created net name(s) with the new grouped net name(s).  "\fB-type [power | ground]\fR" Specifies whether it is a power or ground net. 
.SH Examples
