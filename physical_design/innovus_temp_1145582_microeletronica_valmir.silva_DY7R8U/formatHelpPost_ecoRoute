.P This command is part of an ECO flow process and is based on the NanoRoute router. Based on information from the ecoDefIncommand, this command preprocesses the design for the NanoRoute router and launches ECO routing within the router. This command retrieves the router's mode settings and returns them to their original state at the end of the ECO routing operation.
.RS  "*" 2 When you specify two layers to modify, the first number representing the bottom layer should be smaller than the second number representing top layer (for example, -modifyOnlyLayers 2:3), ecoRoute checks for pin accessibility for new or modified nets and drops VIA12, as necessary.  Note: The via12 and via34 will be used, but tool will not change the metal shapes on M1 and M4.  "*" 2 When a net is modified, some parts of the wire must be reassigned to the new nets. Initially, a whole wire between two cells is assigned to netA. When a buffer is inserted on netA, ecoRoute cuts the wire segment and assigns the left side of the wire to netA and the remaining segment on the right to netB.  "*" 2 You must first run ecoDefIn and ecoPlace before you use this command.  "*" 2 You can run ECO routing in multiple-CPU processing mode. 
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB<area>\fR" Fixes DRC violations is the specified route area. You can specify the area using the x1 y1 x2 y2 coordinate values.  Note: The parameter must be used with the -fix_drc parameter.  Data_type: rect, optional  "\fB-cut_color_flip {0 1}\fR" Fixes cut color DRC violations by flipping. When enabled ( 1 ), the ecoRoute command fixes the cut same-mask spacing violations by flipping the color of the cut.  Note: The parameter must be used with the -fix_drc parameter.  "\fB-fix_drc\fR" Fixes violations on existing DRC markers in the design. When enabled, it allows NanoRoute to fix only the DRC's on existing DRC markers in the design. If violations increase then the ecoRoute command reverts to the original snap shot of the design.   Note: If open nets are found in the design, NanoRoute will error out.   Note: This parameter does not support the -modifyOnlyLayers arguments.  Data_type: bool, optional   "\fB-fix_filler_drc_with_patch_only  \fR" Fixes filler related drc with metal patch only.
.RS  "*" 2 If only the filler-related metal patch drc exists after filler insertion, it can be fixed with the -fix_filler_drc_with_patch_only parameter.  "*" 2 The recommendation flow for chip-finish is:
.RS  "*" 2 ecoRoute. For changed cell eco  "*" 2 addFiller. Inserts full fillers, even if decap and filler insertion is performed in single or multiple steps.  "*" 2 ecoRoute -fix_filler_drc_with_patch_only
.RE 
.RE   Note: Some decap cells might be replaced with normal filler cells due to handling of the vertical stack rule during addFiller. As a result DRC violations relating to patch metal may still be left after full filler insertion if router is called after only decap cells are inserted. Hence, Cadence recommends you to follow the above mentioned chip-finish flow.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each ecoRoute parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man ecoRoute  "\fB-handlePartition\fR" Turns on handling partition flag. For the nets in hierarchical partition design, the ECO routing performed is partition aware with this option.
.RS  "*" 2 Pure top level nets should be routed only in top area.  "*" 2 Inter-partition nets should be routed based on partition pin locations, and there are no multiple entries to a connected partition, the specific partition pin is the only entry for the partition connection.  "*" 2 Intra-partition nets should be routed inside corresponding partition fence.
.RE   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-ignore_route <string>\fR" When specified, the selected net will be routed with highest priority by ignoring existing routes in post-route mode.
.RS  "*" 2 all: Ignores all other nets in the design that are not selected, including clock, secondary PG, and signal nets.  "*" 2 signal: Ignores only other signal nets that are not selected, but honors clock and secondary PG nets.
.RE   For example, the following commands select and route a list of nets by ignoring only other signal nets, and considers secondary PG and clock nets during routing. After that, a second ecoRoute is run to fix DRC violations:  selectNet {net1 net2 net3}  setNanoRouteMode -route_selected_net_only true  ecoRoute -ignore_route signal  setNanoRouteMode -reset -route_selected_net_only  verify_drc -limit 0  ecoRoute  Default:    Type: string, optional  "\fB-layer_range <bottomLayer:topLayer>\fR" Enables the NanoRoute router to fix violations on existing DRC markers in the specified layer range (<bottomLayer>:<topLayer>).  Type: string, optional  "\fB-modifyOnlyLayers <bottomLayer:topLayer>\fR" Enables the NanoRoute router to remove segments of net routing in the specified layer range, from bottomLayer to topLayer, inclusively. You must include a colon (:) between the bottomLayer and topLayer values. This option also restricts eco routing to carry out only on eco nets.  Default: ECO routing can occur on any layer and any nets.  Note: You might want to use -modifyOnlyLayers to specify all layers in order for ecoRoute to avoid touching non-eco nets. In some cases, approach could be faster and result in fewer DRCs.  This command is similar to -bottomRoutingLayer and -topRoutingLayer parameters of the setDesignMode command and the -route_with_eco parameter of the setNanoRouteModecommand. For more information on the ecoRoute command, see the ECO Flows chapter of the Innovus User Guide.  Note: The NanoRoute router does not support the -modifyOnlyLayer option for 10nm and below nodes and displays an error when used.  Note: The -modifyOnlyLayers parameter cannot be specified with the -fix_drc parameter.  Note:  The recommended methods to know the layers and vias that were touched in the freeze metal routing with -modifyOnlyLayers <bottomLayer:topLayer> are:
.RS  "*" 2 Use the defComp -metalShapeDiff  command to compare the def file before and after using the ecoRoute command.  "*" 2 Use Pegasus to compare the gds file.
.RE   Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-passive_fill\fR" When specified, it does passive fill after filler fixing. This helps to save extra import/export time.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-prototype\fR" Enables prototyping while doing ECO routing. When specified, it enables NanoRoute to work on the nets selected to route and stop early before DRC cleanup to provide a quick snapshot for the designer. This mode is intended to help the designer know if the routing is possible and if the ECO can improve timing.  Note: In this mode the routes are not DRC clean  "\fB-target\fR" Enables NanoRoute to work on only eco nets identified by NanoRoute to route. In this mode, the router ignores the already existing DRC violation markers that are not on the ECO nets or are on nets selected to route.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-trim_layer_patch\fR" Enables the ecoRoute command to only add trim and patch metals in a given area. Using the -trim_layer_patch parameter, you can  fix drc violations flagged in sign-off/verify_drc and only add trim and patch metals where minimum spacing criteria is not met.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Examples
.P The following example allows the NanoRoute router to perform ECO routing only on or between layers 2 and 3, VIA12 will be dropped if necessary :
.P ecoRoute -modifyOnlyLayers 2:3
.P If DRCs exist after you run the ecoRoute command, this could be because ecoRoute cannot touch non-eco nets. You can reroute the DRC area as shown below:
.P setNanoRouteMode -quiet -route_with_eco true   ecoRoute -modifyOnlyLayers 1:3   setNanoRouteMode -quiet -route_selected_net_only false   globalDetailRoute 100.0 1200.0 350.0 600.0
