.SH Name \fBsetModuleView\fR \-  Specifies the FlexView (readOnly|interface|all) for the top level and each of the partitions
.SH Syntax \fBsetModuleView\fR  [-help]  [-topReadOnly {true | false}]  [-hinst {<list_of_partition_hinsts>}]  [-partition {<list_of_paritions>}]  [-type {readOnly|interface|all}]  
.P Specifies the FlexView (readOnly|interface|all) for the top level and each of the partitions. This way optimization can be limited to the selected sections of the partitions and the top-level logic. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setModuleView parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setModuleView.  "\fB-topReadOnly {true | false}\fR" Sets the top level to the read-only mode. By default, optimization can change the logic at the top level to improve timing. By setting this option to true, no change will be done to the entire top-level logic.  Default: false  "\fB-hinst <list_of_partition_hinsts>\fR" Applies the selected FlexView mode to the instance name or list of instance names of partitions.  "\fB-partition <list_of_partitions>\fR" Applies the selected FlexView mode to a partition or list of partitions.  You have a choice to either specify the instance name of the partition or just the partition itself.  "\fB-type {readOnly|interface|all}\fR" Specifies the FlexView mode for the specified partition(s).
.RS  "*" 2 readOnly : Specifies that the optimization will not be performed inside the partition.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 interface: Specifies that optimization will be restricted only to the interface logic of the partition.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 all : Specifies that optimization will be done for the entire partition.
