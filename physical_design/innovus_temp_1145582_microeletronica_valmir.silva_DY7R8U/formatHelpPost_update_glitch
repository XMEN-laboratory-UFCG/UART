.TH update_glitch  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBupdate_glitch\fR \-  Allows you to run glitch analysis without running SI delay analysis
.SH Syntax \fBupdate_glitch\fR   [-help]  [-effort {medium | high}] 
.P Allows you to run glitch analysis without running SI delay analysis. This command provides the ability to run glitch analysis on all the nets in a design or on a subset of nets.
.P Using the update_glitch command without report_timing or update_timing will only run glitch analysis.
.P Note: It is not recommended to run the update_glitch command after the report_timing or update_timing command.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each update_glitch parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the  man command:  man update_glitch.   "\fB-effort {medium | high}\fR" Specifies the effort level for update glitch.  When set to high, glitch analysis uses more accurate modeling of glitch for small attackers, thereby reducing pessimism.  Note: The run time in high mode may be slightly higher, and is largely dependent on the distribution of coupling.  Default: medium
