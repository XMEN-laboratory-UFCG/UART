.SH Name \fBsetIlmMode\fR \-  Controls certain behaviors of ILM commands
.SH Syntax \fBsetIlmMode\fR  [-help]   [-reset]  [-filterInternalPath {true|false}]   [-keepAsync {true|false}]  [-keepHighFanoutPorts {true|false}]  [-keepInstInSdc {true|false}]  [-ilm <ilmName>]  [-ilmCell <ilmCellName>]   [-keepFlatten {true|false}]  [-keepLoopBack {true|false}]   [-map {view|corner}]  [-maxNumInsts <maxInstances>]   [-maxNumRegisters <maxRegisters>]  [-resetMap {view|corner}]   [-slackDriven {true|false}]  [-top <topViewName>]
.P Controls certain behaviors of ILM commands.
.P Use the getIlmMode command to display the current settings for the setIlmMode command.
.P You can set certain options through setIlmMode which can control how ILMs are created or the way top level is mapped to ILMs in case of mismatch between view/corner naming between block and top. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setIlmMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setIlmMode.  "\fB-filterInternalPath {true|false}\fR" Filters the internal path kept by ILM. When set to true, group paths are created for internal paths with slack adjustment of 9999. Therefore, all internal paths are filtered out from the timing report.  Default: false  "\fB-keepAsync {true | false}\fR" Keeps paths from asynchronous input ports when ILMs are created by createInterfaceLogic. For example, paths from an input port to the reset pin of interface sequential instances, but not to the internal sequential instances.  Default: false  "\fB-keepHighFanoutPorts {true | false}\fR" Keeps high-fanin outputs and high-fanout inputs when ILMs are created by createInterfaceLogic.  Default: true  "\fB-keepInstInSdc {true|false}\fR" Keeps instances which have constraints on it.  Default: false  "\fB<-ilm ilmViewName>|<ilmCornerName>\fR" Specifies the view or corner name of an ILM that is to be mapped to the top level.   "\fB-ilmCell <ilmCellName>\fR" Specifies the cell name of an ILM that has view or corner mapping to the top level.  "\fB-keepFlatten {true|false}\fR" Makes flow work under the flattenIlm mode.   Default: true  "\fB-keepLoopBack {true | false}\fR" Keeps loop back paths when ILMs are created by createInterfaceLogic.  When set to true, then any path touching a net used for the ILM model is also included. This is done for better model accuracy, so that the actual capacitance on an output port could affect the delay on a net which feeds an internal path that is normally not included in the ILM model. This also degrades the reduction ratio (#ILM_insts/#all_inst) for the block.  Default: false  "\fB-map {view | corner}\fR" Maps a view or corner specified in an ILM to a view or corner of the top-design analysis.  Default: view  "\fB-maxNumInsts <maxInstances> \fR" Specifies the maximum number of instances.  Default:1000  "\fB-maxNumRegisters <maxRegisters>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of registers.  Default: 40  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified options to default value.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-resetMap {view | corner}\fR" Resets view or corner mapping between an ILM and the top level.  Default: view  "\fB-slackDriven {true|false} \fR" Specifies slack driven ILM generation.  Default: false  "\fB-top <topViewName>|<topCornerName>\fR" Specifies the view or corner name of top design analysis while creating the mapping between the ILM and the top level.  Default: ""
