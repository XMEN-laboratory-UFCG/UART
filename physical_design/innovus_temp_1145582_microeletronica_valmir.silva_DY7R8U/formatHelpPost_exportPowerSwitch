.SH Name \fBexportPowerSwitch\fR \-  Exports power switch database
.SH Syntax \fBexportPowerSwitch\fR  [-help]   [-powerDomain <powerDomainName>]   [-file <fileName>] 
.P Exports power switch database. The command is needed in cases of defIn-based flows where power switch database required for power switch related operations is not loaded through defIn. So, use exportPowerSwitch to save power switch database after power switch insertion using addPowerSwitch for later use, which can be loaded back using importPowerSwitch.
.P For example, in case power switches are inserted at the Floor Plan stage and the power switch database is exported for further use in the flow, the following command executed after floorplan for power Domain PD1, will save the power switch information into the PD1_powerswitch.db file:
.P exportPowerSwitch -powerDomain PD1 -file PD1_powerswitch.db
.P Post running the above command, if the floorplan DEF is used in the flow from synthesis, the stored power switch information needs to be restored using the importPowerSwitch command from the database, which was earlier stored using the exportPowerSwitch command after floorplan and before placement.
.P Note: The enable net IN and OUT connections should remain the same in the netlist in power switch database export/import process and the commands need not be run when saveDesignand defOut are run because the power switch database is automatically saved and restored. 
.SH PSO File Generation and Usage
.P A PSO file gets generated as an output of the exportPowerSwitch command, which can be used in a future session, if needed. One scenario where this file can be needed is when a DEF file containing a power switch chain is not used in the power switch synthesis and hence the incoming netlist to Innovus would not have any power switches. The power switch chain is then created at the init stage of Innovus using the addPowerSwitch command in such a run. A database saved using write_db after running the addPowerSwitch command, will have the power switch chain saved in a <design.pso> file. When restored, this database can also be used to write out the saved PSO file using the exportPowerSwitch command. When the power switches are added using the addPowerSwitch command, the reportPowerSwitch command can be used to validate their addition.
.P To avoid regenerating power switches in future implementation runs, save the power switch chain using the exportPowerSwitch command along with the floorplan DEF. Ensure that the -routing parameter of the defOut command is also used along with -floorplan and -noStdCells to save the power switch network under the NETS section of the DEF.
.P Refer to the following flows to understand the usage of the PSO file:
.P Innovus Session 1:
.P <init Design1 - incoming design has no power switches>  addPowerSwitch  exportPowerSwitch test.pso  defOut -floorplan -noStdCells -routing test.def
.P Innovus Session 2:
.P <init Design2 - incoming design has no power switches>  importPowerSwitch -file test.pso  defIn test.def
.P While reading the DEF file, you can identify the power switches using the database commands, such as get_db and dbIsCellPowerSwitch, even without using the importPowerSwitch command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each exportPowerSwitch parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man exportPowerSwitch.  "\fB-powerDomain <powerDomainName>\fR" Specifies the power domain whose power switch information is to be exported.  "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the export file.
