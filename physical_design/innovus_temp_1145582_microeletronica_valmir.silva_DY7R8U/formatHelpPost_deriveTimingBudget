.SH Name \fBderiveTimingBudget\fR \-  Generates timing budgets for partitions for standalone implementation
.SH Syntax \fBderiveTimingBudget\fR  [-help]  [-parameterized]  [-cycleRatio | -stageBased | -timingCore | -preliminary | -pushDownSDC]  [-allIlmHinsts | -inst <instanceName>| -ptn <partitionName>]  [-verbose]  [-views <string>] 
.P Generates timing budgets for partitions for standalone implementation. This command can also generate timing budgets on an instance basis instead of partitions. The generated timing constraint files allow you to do standalone block implementation. In case of partition based budgeting, it also generates timing models that will allow you to do standalone top level implementation. This command also directs summary files into the default budget justification directory.
.P Note: You must free the timing graph to use multiple deriveTimingBudget commands with different options.
.P Innovus operates in multi-mode multi-corner (MMMC) mode, and generates viewFilesautomatically for partition implementation and top-level chip assembly. Note that the deriveTimingBudget command does not generate a timing graph, if it already exists. Additionally, user will have to provide a timing graph generated without using deriveTimingBudget and must set the value of the setBudgetingMode -virtualOptEngine parameter same as that of the command used to generate the timing graph.
.P When the deriveTimingBudget command is run, all the public setBudgetingMode parameters with their non-default values are displayed before the intended output of the deriveTimingBudget command, in an information message. This information message follows the format shown below:
