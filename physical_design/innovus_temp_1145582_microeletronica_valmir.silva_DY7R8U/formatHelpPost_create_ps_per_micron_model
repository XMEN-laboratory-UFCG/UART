.TH create_ps_per_micron_model  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreate_ps_per_micron_model\fR \-  Derives psPM.model as a separate command. This command is used for active logic flat top model generation. For non-ART model generation, psPM.model can still be generated during create_proto_model step. It supports MMMC where it can automatically generate a psPM model file for each delay corner
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_ps_per_micron_model\fR  [-help]    [-overwrite]  
.P Derives psPM.model as a separate command. This command is used for active logic flat top model generation. For non-ART model generation, psPM.model can still be generated during create_proto_model step. It supports MMMC where it can automatically generate a psPM model file for each delay corner. with this, you can do corner dependent psPM budgeting and generated hold budgeting that is accurate where correct corner is used for hold instead of using one corner for both hold and setup. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_ps_per_micron_model parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command: man create_ps_per_micron_model.  "\fB-overwrite\fR" Overwrites an existing psPM.model.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Examples
.P The following commands generate psPM.model before running the create_proto_model command:
.P restoreDesign DBS/init_design.enc.dat dtmf_recvr_core
.P create_ps_per_micron_model   identify_proto_model  create_proto_model -flat_top DBS/model_gen.enc
