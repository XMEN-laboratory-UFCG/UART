.TH set_input_transition  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_input_transition\fR \-  Specifies the slew time for a port on the top level module
.SH Syntax \fBset_input_transition\fR  [-help]  [-min]  [-max]   [-rise]  [-fall]  <transition_time>  <port_list> 
.P Specifies the slew time for a port on the top level module. This command is useful only in specifying a hard ramp signal as if the port were driven by a very powerful driver. The command does not change the arrival time of an input, but changes the slew time used to compute the delay of the cell on the sink of a net. If you do not define transition using the set_input_transition command, the software uses the default input port transition defined in the configuration file. The default value is 0.1ps. You can also set the delaycal_input_transition_delay global variable to override the default value.
.P The set_input_transition command specification for clock signals does not impact setup/hold timing calculations.
.P Note: The set_input_transition command does not support internal pins. For specifying transition on internal pins use the set_annotated_transitionset_annotated_transition command. 
.P Note: The most recent command settings (of set_driving_cell, set_input_transition, or set_drive) that are applied to a port will be considered - the software will override the previous commands. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-fall | -rise\fR" Specifies that the slew time should be applied to the rising edge or the falling edge of the signal (data or clock). If neither time is specified, the default is to use both.  "\fB-min | -max\fR" Indicates whether the slew times are with respect to the early (hold) or the late (setup) time checks of the data signal. If neither option is specified, the default is to use both.  "\fB<port_list>\fR" Specifies the list of ports for which the slew time is specified.  Note: You cannot use the set_input_transition command to specify transition on output ports.  Note: When you use both set_input_transition and set_annotated_transition commands for specifying transition on input ports, the worst value is used as the transition value.  "\fB<transition_time>\fR" Specifies the transition time. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies the slew time of 0.5 on port input3.  set_input_transition 0.5 input3
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies the input falling slew of 0.6ns on the port input1 for minimum delay type:  set_input_transition -min -fall 0.6 input1
