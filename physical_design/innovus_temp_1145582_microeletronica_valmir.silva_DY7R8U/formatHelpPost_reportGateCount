.SH Name \fBreportGateCount\fR \-  Reports the size of the imported design, measured in gate counts
.SH Syntax \fBreportGateCount\fR  [-help]  [-hinst <hinst_name>]   [-level <level>]  [-limit <gateCount>]   [-stdCellOnly]  [-outfile <fileName>]  
.P Reports the size of the imported design, measured in gate counts.
.P The software calculates the gate count for a module using the following equation:
.P gateCount = moduleArea / gateSize
.P Where:
.RS  "*" 2 moduleArea is the area of the module. By default, this is the sum of the areas of all instances inside of the module, including standard cells, blocks, and I/O cells. If you specify the -stdCellOnly parameter, moduleArea is the sum of the areas of the standard cells inside the module only.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 gateSize is calculated as follows:   gateSize = dbgStdCellHgt x dbgDBUPerIGU x dbgSitesPerGate  Where:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 dbgStdCellHgt is the standard cell row height.

.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 dbgDBUPerIGU is the M2 layer pitch.

.RS
.RS  "*" 2 dbgSitesPerGate is a user-defined global variable that determines the gate size the software assumes when calculating the gate count. For example, the default value of 3 means the assumed the gate size is equal to 1 standard cell row height and 3 M2 layer pitch widths. You can change this value to adjust the assumed gate size for each specific design.

.P You can use the reportGateCount command after importing the design.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportGateCount parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man reportGateCount.  "\fB-level <level>\fR" Expands the module to the specified level.  For example, if you specify 1, CTS expands the specified module by one level. The gate counts of all "children" modules of the module that satisfy the -limit parameter are included in the gate count report. If you specify 2, CTS expands the module by two levels. The gate counts of all "children" and "grandchildren" modules of the module are included in the gate count report.  Default: Module is not expanded, and CTS reports only the gate count of the module itself. (This is equivalent to specifying a level of 0.)  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-limit <gateCount>\fR" Instructs CTS to ignore modules with gate counts below the specified limit. Such modules are ignored during expansion and reporting.  Default: CTS ignores modules with 1000 or fewer gates during expansion and reporting.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-hinst <hinst_name>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical instance for which to generate a gate count report.  Default: Generates a gate count report for the hierarchical instance corresponding to the top cell of the design.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-outfile <fileName>\fR" Writes out the gate count report to the specified file name. The default file extension is
.gateCount.  Default: Displays the gate count report only in the Innovus console.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-stdCellOnly\fR" Calculates gate count based only on standard cells within the specified module. Blocks and I/O cells within the module are ignored.  Data_type: bool, optional
