.SH Name \fBloadWorkspace\fR \-  Loads the named workspace from the specified directory
.SH Syntax \fBloadWorkspace\fR  [-help]   -name <workspaceName>  [-dir <directory>] 
.P Loads the named workspace from the specified directory. A workspace contains customized main window settings including:
.RS  "*" 2 Size and placement of window
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Specific orientation of toolbars
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Docking status
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Visibility settings

.P You can use the loadWorkspace command at any stage in the design flow to load a previously saved workspace. However, if you want Innovus to load a specific workspace automatically on starting, you need to first set that workspace as default using the setDefaultWorkspace command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each loadWorkspace parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man loadWorkspace  "\fB-name <workspaceName>\fR" Specifies the name of the workspace to be loaded.  "\fB-dir <directory>\fR" Specifies the directory from which the workspace is to be loaded. The default search order to access directories for loading workspaces is as below:
.RS  "*" 2 Current working directory
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 User home directory
.RE   The -dir parameter is useful if you have workspaces with the same name in both the current working directory and your home directory. If you do not specify -dir, the software loads the <workspaceName> workspace from the current working directory. 
.SH Example
.P The following example loads the MyWorkspace workspace from the current working directory.
.P loadWorkspace -name MyWorkspace
