.P Controls certain aspects of GDSII Stream files generated by the Innovus software.
.P You can use the setStreamOutMode command any time before running the streamOut command.
.P Use the getStreamOutMode command to return current settings for the setStreamOutMode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setStreamOutMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setStreamOutMode.  "\fB-cellInstanceColor {true|false}\fR" Streams out the instance-based color. The instance mask shift is honored in streamOut. When the option is on and the -merge option is used, the merged gds files with mask shift suffix must be provided through the -merge option.  Default: false  "\fB-cellMasterColor {true|false}\fR" Streams out the cell-based color from the Innovus color engine.  Default: true  "\fB-cellNameUserPrefix {prefix}\fR" Adds a prefix to all cell names being written out. Uses the user-specified prefix to avoid potential conflict when integrating different macros, which are potentially two different cells (in two different libraries) with the same name.   "\fB-cellNameUserSuffix {suffix}\fR" Use the user-specified suffix instead of appending color pattern to normal cell names. This applies only to the fixed color shift (flip) pattern (i.e. the single-shift, flip, pattern) applied to the design.  Default: ""  "\fB-cellNameUserSuffix {suffix}\fR" Use user-specified suffix instead of appending color pattern to normal cell names. This applies only to the fixed color shift (flip) pattern (i.e. the single-shift, flip, pattern) applied to the design.  Default: ""  "\fB-check_map_file {true|false}\fR" Checks the specified map file. If the objects exist in Innovus and but these objects are not mapped in the map file, the missed objects mapping and missed objects are printed in the log file. Tool checks only the main objects mapping.  Default: false  "\fB-ignoreFixedMask {true|false}\fR" Ignore macro FIXEDMASK keywords, enable color flip function.  "\fB-labelAllPinShape {true | false}\fR" Labels all pin shapes, whether or not they are physically connected, when set to true.  Default: false  "\fB-mergeAppend {true|false}\fR" Merges the object shapes from the Innovus DB and object shapes from the external cell gdsii/oasis files. If the metal layers have multi-pattern shapes, the color information from the Innovus DB is used.  For example:
.RS  "*" 2 If the instance color is not flipped, the instance object shapes are merged to the object shapes from the same name cell of external gdsii/oasis files.  "*" 2 If the instance color is flipped, the instance object shapes are merged to the object shapes from the same name cell (with mask shift suffix) of external gdsii/oasis files. If there is no color shift cell in the gdsii/oasis files, the same name cell is used from external gdsii/oasis files.
.RE    Default: false  "\fB-oasisCompression {true|false}\fR" CBLOCK compression is partial-selective encryption technology uses OASIS CBLOCK records to encrypt arbitrarily encapsulated sets of data records within an OASIS layout file. REPETITION compression supports an 'array' of cell placements, geometries, or text elements, instead of write each the element separate only different in position, this can save duplicate information for an OASIS layout file size.  Default: true  "\fB-oasisLayerName {true|false}\fR" Support LAYERNAME in the OASIS file.  Default: false  "\fB-oasisSCellOffset {true|false}\fR" Includes cell offset table to declare the byte offset from the beginning of the file (byte 0) to the corresponding CELL record location that appears in the file.  Default: false   "\fB-pinTextOrientation {default | automatic}\fR" Controls the pin text orientation, making it more readable. 
.RS  "*" 2 default implies that the labels are centered in the pin shapes and have R0 orientation and LowerLeft justification.  "*" 2 automatic implies that the labels for pin shapes that are abutted to the design boundary are centered on the edge of the pin shape.
.RE   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-removeNets {<list_of_nets>}\fR" Removes the specified nets from the output file.  Default: "" (empty string)  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setStreamOutMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-SEcompatible {true | false}\fR" Output instance only if FOREIGN is specified.  Default: false  "\fB-SEvianames {true | false}\fR" Determines the naming convention used for vias declared in the LEF file.   Default: false
.RS  "*" 2 Specify true to create unique names.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Specify false to retain LEF via names.
.RE   "\fB-snapToMGrid {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to snap the nets' wires to the manufacturing grid.  Default: false  "\fB-specifyViaName {default | <format_string>}\fR" Specifies the naming convention that the streamOut command uses for via cells declared in the DEF file.   Default: %t_VIA%u (This default value is used so that the names of the via cells are compatible with versions 4.2 and earlier versions of the Innovus software.)  Note: When the version of the GDS file is 3 (this is the default version), via names are truncated if they are longer than 32 characters. The software automatically appends a unique identifier to names if there is a name conflict.  You can use any of the following characters to specify a format string to generate names that give you information about the cell contents. Separate the characters with underscores (_) to improve readability. You can list them in any order.  "*" 2 %c  Specifies the number of columns.
.RS  "*" 2 %l(lcu)  Specifies the via layers. For the lower layer, use %l or %l(l). For the cut layer, use %l(c). For the upper layer, use %l(u). You can specify one, two, or all three layers. You must enclose the l, c, and u in parentheses, as in the following examples: %l(c), %l(lu).
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 %n  Specifies the number of cut rows and columns that make up a cut array.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 %r  Specifies the number of cut rows.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 %t  Specifies the top structure name.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 %u  Specifies a unique number for the via.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 %v  Specifies the via name in the DEF file.
.RE   For more information, see "Vias," in the DEF Syntax chapter of the LEF/DEF Language Reference.  "\fB-streamConvertRectToPath {true|false}\fR" Converts DEF SPECIALNETS path/rectangle and FILLS shapes to GDSII/stream PATH data instead of BOUNDARY data when enabled. Conversion to path data can result in significantly smaller output database when there are many rectangle shapes (example: after metal fill is included).  Default: false  "\fB-streamVersion <version_number>\fR" Specifies the version for a created GDSII Stream file. If you use the streamOut -merge parameter, streamOut uses the highest version of the merged files, instead of the value specified by the parameter.  Default: 3  Minimum:1  Maximum: 32767  "\fB-supportPathType4 {true | false}\fR" Converts PATHTYPE4 to PATHTYPE0. If you specify -supportPathType4 false, the software converts PATHTYPE4 paths to PATHTYPE0 when outputting the path.  Default: true  "\fB-textSize <value>\fR" Changes the size of the text used in the text labels in the GDSII Stream file written by the Innovus software.   Default: 1
.RS  "*" 2 To increase the size of the text, specify a positive real number that is greater than 1, as in the following example:   setStreamOutMode -textSize 10.0
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 To decrease the size of the text, specify a positive real number that is less than 1, as in the following example:   setStreamOutMode -textSize 0.5
.RE   Note: The -textSize parameter affects the size of only automatically created text. It does not affect text created through add_gui_text.  "\fB-uniquifyCellNamesPrefix {true | false}\fR" Adds a prefix, instead of a suffix, to uniquified cell names. The prefix is the source filename. If this parameter is not specified, the software adds a suffix (also the source filename) to uniquified cell names.  "\fB-virtualConnection {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether a colon (:) label is appended to pin names for DEF pins with the
.extra<N> syntax and to LEF pins with multiple ports (if -outputMacros is specified for LEF pin ports that have disjoint shapes).  Default: true
.RS  "*" 2 Specify true to append a colon to pin names.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Specify false not to append a colon to pin names.
.RE   Note: For more information, see the DEF Syntax chapter of the LEF/DEF Language Reference. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command retains the via names defined in the LEF file:   setStreamOutMode -SEvianames false   When you type this command and run the streamOut command, the Innovus software does the following:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 For block1, the software creates VIA12Default, VIA12DoubleCut, and so on.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 For block2, the software creates VIA12Default, VIA12DoubleCut, and so on.   If block1 and block2 are later merged into a top-level design, name collisions of the via masters occur. This result is acceptable if these are the same vias. However, if the vias are not the same, this command causes errors.
.RE 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates unique via names for vias defined in the LEF file:   setStreamOutMode -SEvianames true  When you type this command and run streamOut, the Innovus software does the following:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 For block1, the software creates block1_VIA1, block1_VIA2, and so on.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 For block2, the software creates block2_VIA1, block2_VIA2, and so on.   If block1 and block2 are later merged, there is no risk of name collision between via masters.
.RE 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates names for via cells. The names identify the top structure name (%v), lower via layer (%l(l)), and DEF via name (%v):   setStreamOutMode -specifyViaName %t_%v_%l(l)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command resets the -SEvianames parameter to its default value:   setStreamOutMode -reset -SEvianames
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command resets all setStreamOutMode parameters to their default values:   setStreamOutMode -reset   "*" 2 The following command specifies ABCDEFG as the suffix for the color flipped cells.   setStreamOutMode -cellNameUserSuffix ABCDEFG   When this command is used, ABCDEFG is suffixed for color flipped cells.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  Without this command, suffix are automatically added for color flipped cells.
