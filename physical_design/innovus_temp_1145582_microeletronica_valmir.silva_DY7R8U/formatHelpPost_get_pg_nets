.SH Name \fBget_pg_nets\fR \-  Creates a collection of netlist-level instance PG nets of leaf cells/pins in the current design
.SH Syntax \fBget_pg_nets\fR   [-help]  [-filter <expr>]  [-of_objects <object_list>]
.P Creates a collection of netlist-level instance PG nets of leaf cells/pins in the current design. An empty collection is returned if no PG net definitions/connections are found in the design netlist. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help                             \fR" Prints out the command usage.  "\fB-filter <expr>                \fR" Specifies the filters for the collection with the specified expression.  For any pg nets that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the net.  You can filter pg nets along with the -of_objects parameter - using any of the pg net properties of object type pg_net (supported through the get_property command).  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all the PG nets, or PG nets associated with the specified cells or PG pins.  You can specify a list of cells or a list of pg pins, but you cannot specify a list that contains cells and pg pins together.  The -of_objects parameter supports get_cells and get_pg_pins as valid objects.  For example,  get_pg_nets -of_objects [get_cells iA/out_reg] VSS VDD2  get_pg_nets -of_objects [get_pg_pins -of_objects [get_cells iA/out_reg]] VSS VDD2  get_pg_nets * 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command filters the collection of all pg nets of the cell instance object to return only the pg nets containing the string name defined with the pg_net hierarchical_name attribute:  get_pg_nets -of_objects [get_cells iA/out_reg] -filter "hierarchical_name =~ *VDD*"
