.SH Name \fBreport_ccopt_clock_trees\fR \-  This command reports a summary of all defined clock trees
.SH Syntax \fBreport_ccopt_clock_trees\fR  [-help]  [-clock_trees {<list_of_clock_trees>}]  [-delay_corners {<list_of_delay_corners>} | -views {<list_of_views>}]  [-file <file_name>]  [-histograms]  [-list_special_pins]  [-no_invalidate]  [-num_cap_violating_pins <number_of_pins>]  [-num_fanout_violating_nets <number_of_nets>]  [-num_length_violating_nets <number_of_nets>]  [-num_resistance_violating_nets <number_of_nets>]  [-num_slew_violating_pins <number_of_pins>]   [-skip_timing_update]  [-summary]  [-tcl_list]  [-early | -late]  
.P This command reports a summary of all defined clock trees. In particular, this report provides a summary of numbers of clock gates at different depths in each clock tree. Use the report_ccopt_clock_trees command to monitor the amount of clock gating used in the design and the buffering used in the clock tree. You can run this command any time after defining or extracting clock trees. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_ccopt_clock_trees parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man report_ccopt_clock_trees.   "\fB-clock_trees {list_of_clock_trees}\fR" Specifies that the report will be restricted to the specified clock trees.   "\fB-delay_corners  {<list_of_delay_corners>}      \fR" Specifies that the report will be restricted to the specified delay corners.  Note: The -delay_corners and -views parameters are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-early\fR" Specifies that only the early half of the delay corners will be reported.   "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Specifies that a copy of  the contents of the report will be saved to the specified file name.   "\fB-histograms \fR" Specifies that histograms of key information will be displayed.   "\fB-late\fR" Specifies that only the late half of the delay corners will be reported.   "\fB-list_special_pins\fR" Specifies that the report will list individual pins that are stop, ignore, min, or other special type of pins.   "\fB-no_invalidate\fR" Specifies that the timing engine should not be invalidated. The timing engine is used to calculate the timing data that is displayed in the report. By default, this is invalidated when you generate the report, so all the timing data is recalculated. This increases the time taken to generate the report. Use the -no_invalidate option to reuse the existing timing data for the report.   "\fB-num_cap_violating_pins <number_of_pins>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of capacitance violating pins reported in the "Max capacitance violation summary across all clock trees" table of the report.  By default, the software reports the top 10 violations.  "\fB-num_fanout_violating_nets <number_of_nets>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of violating fanout nets reported in the "Max fanout violation summary across all clock trees" table of the report.  By default, the software reports the top 10 violations.  "\fB-num_length_violating_nets <number_of_nets>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of max_source_to_sink_net_length violating nets reported in the "Max length violation summary across all clock trees" table of the report.  By default, the software reports the top 10 violations.  "\fB-num_resistance_violating_nets <number_of_nets>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of max_source_to_sink_net_resistance violating nets reported in the "Max resistance violation summary across all clock trees" table of the report.  By default, the software reports the top 10 violations.  "\fB-num_slew_violating_pins <number_of_pins> \fR" Specifies the maximum number of worst slew violating pins that are reported in the "Slew violation summary across all clock trees" table.  By default, the software reports the top 10 violations.  "\fB-skip_timing_update\fR" Specifies that the timing engine should not be updated. The timing engine is used to calculate the timing data that is displayed in the report. By default, when you generate the report, the timing data is recalculated. This increases the time taken to generate the report. Specify this parameter to skip calculation of timing data.   "\fB-summary\fR" Specifies that just the summary table should be displayed in the report.   "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Specifies that the report will be created as Tcl data instead of a text report.   "\fB-views {<list_of_views>}\fR" Restricts the report to the delay corners associated with the specified views.  Note: The -delay_corners and -views parameters are mutually exclusive.
