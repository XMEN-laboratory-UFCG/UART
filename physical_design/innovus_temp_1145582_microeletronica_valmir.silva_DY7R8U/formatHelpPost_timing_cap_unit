.SH Name \fBtiming_cap_unit\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_cap_unit\fR <string> 
.P Default: " "
.P Specifies the capacitance units to be used for timing constraints and timing reports. The default unit for capacitance is inferred from the timing libraries. You can override this inference by explicitly setting the value to 1pf or 1ff. Setting this variable explicitly is the same as executing the setLibraryUnit -cap command to set the capacitance units.
.P To set this variable, use the set command.
.P For example,
.P set timing_cap_unit 1pf
