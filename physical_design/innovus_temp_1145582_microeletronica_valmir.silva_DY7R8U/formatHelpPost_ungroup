.SH Name \fBungroup\fR \-  Ungroups the specified hinsts
.SH Syntax \fBungroup\fR  [-help]  <hInst>+   [-exclude <hinst>+]   [-flatten]  [-honor_dont_touch]   [-threshold <instance_count>]  [-verbose]   [-simple  | -prefix <prefix> | -escaped ]  
.P Ungroups the specified hinsts. Ungrouping dissolves the hinsts and moves the contents into its parent directory. By default, an hinst or an inst inside one of the ungrouped hinsts is renamed by concatenating its name to its parent's name with _. for example, ungroup h1, would rename h1/i1 to h1_i1.  Name collisions are resolved by appending _1, _2, etc. until a unique name is found. If a given hinst cannot be ungrouped, a warning is issued about why it cannot be ungrouped. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each ungroup.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man ungroup  "\fB<hInst>+\fR" Specifies the hinst(s) to be ungrouped.    "\fB-escaped\fR" Flattened names use escaped hinst names.  For example, h1/i1 becomes \\h1/i1 in Verilog and h1\\/i1 in DEF.   "\fB-exclude <hinst>+\fR" Excludes specified hinst(s) as ungroup targets.  "\fB-flatten\fR" Ungroups recursively below the specified hinst(s)  "\fB-honor_dont_touch\fR" Skips the hinst that is marked as dont touch.   "\fB-prefix <prefix>\fR" Flattened names use a prefix. For example, h1/i1 becomes <prefix>_i1.    "\fB-simple\fR" Flattened names use the base_name. For example, h1/i1 becomes i1.    "\fB-threshold <instance_count>\fR" Ungroups only those hinsts that have an instance count less than or equal to the specified integer.    "\fB-verbose\fR" Prints the names of the hierarchies that are being ungrouped. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command will flatten h1, h2/h3. It will recursively flatten any lower hinsts that have an inst count <= 10 and do not have 'cpu' in their name.  >ungroup {h1 h2/h3} -exclude *cpu* -flatten -threshold 10 -prefix test  "*" 2  This command ungroups all hinsts matching h1* and uses escaped names for the flattened names. This is useful so external SDC files that only refer to inst and pin names will still work but it may cause problems in down-stream tools that do not support escaped names. Note that hpins and hnets of ungrouped hinsts will disappear, so usage of those names will no longer work.  >ungroup h1* -escaped  An inst named h1/i1 will become h1\\/i1.  Various commands like get_cells will still soft-match h1/i1 to the escaped h1\\/i1 name.
