.SH Name \fBcompress_special\fR \-  Compresses Power-Grid (PG) based on the specified area, layer, or net
.SH Syntax \fBcompress_special\fR  [-help]  [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]  [-incremental]  [-layers <layer>+]  [-nets <net>+]
.P Compresses Power-Grid (PG) based on the specified area, layer, or net. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each compress_special parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man compress_special  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates for the area from which PG needs to be compressed. The compress_special command compresses only those special wires and special vias, which exist within the area specified by this parameter.  Default: All PG structures are compressed.  "\fB-incremental\fR" Recompresses the PG after editing the PG wires or vias. This parameter can only be specified when the current design is in compressed mode.  "\fB-layers <layer>+\fR" Specifies the layers on which PG compression is needed. This parameter requires either LEF layer names or a routing layer index value (for example, 1 for the first routing layer,  2 for the second routing layer, and so on).   "\fB-nets <net>+\fR" Specifies the nets from which PG compression is needed. If the specified net does not have any special route on it, it is ignored. 
.SH Example
.P The following command compresses %s special_wires and %s special_vias:
.P compress_special -area {100 100 120 120} -net VDD -incremental
