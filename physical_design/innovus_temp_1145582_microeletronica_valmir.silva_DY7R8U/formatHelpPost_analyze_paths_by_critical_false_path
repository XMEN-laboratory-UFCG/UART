.TH analyze_paths_by_critical_false_path  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBanalyze_paths_by_critical_false_path\fR \-  Identifies violating false paths, which are paths that appear as violations but cannot be exercised due to the structure of the netlist, and creates a category that contains them
.SH Syntax \fBanalyze_paths_by_critical_false_path\fR  [-help]  [-critical_false_paths {false_path_only | exclude_false_path}]  [-master <string>] 
.P Identifies violating false paths, which are paths that appear as violations but cannot be exercised due to the structure of the netlist, and creates a category that contains them. With this command the user can, in advance, categorize the critical false paths together to analyze them.
.P The command can be applied wherever the user loads the machine readable timing report.
.P For more information on creating path categories, see "Creating Path Categories" in the Debugging Timing Results chapter of User Guide. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each analyze_paths_by_critical_false_path parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man analyze_paths_by_critical_false_path  "\fB-critical_false_paths\fR" Specifies which paths to analyze. You can select one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 false_path_only  Includes only false paths when creating the category.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 exclude_false_path  Excludes false paths when creating the category.
.RE   Default: false_path_only  "\fB-master <string>\fR" Specifies that the analysis should be performed only for the specified master category. 
.SH Examples:
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates path categories based on the critical false paths:   analyze_paths_by_critical_false_path -critical_false_path false_path_only
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following category is created: default_report_false_path_only
.RE
