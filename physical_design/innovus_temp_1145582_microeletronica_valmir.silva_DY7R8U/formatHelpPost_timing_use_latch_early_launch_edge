.SH Name \fBtiming_use_latch_early_launch_edge\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_use_latch_early_launch_edge\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: true
.P Enables the latch use early launch edge feature.
.P During timing analysis when time borrowing and clock path pessimism removal (CPPR) is enabled, the given time is calculated using both borrow time and CPPR time. This may result in unnecessary timing violations. Since CPPR is an accurate means of pessimism removal, you are required to set the timing_use_latch_early_launch_edge global variable to false so that CPPR is applied to all the paths in the design.
.P When set to true, the launch clock path of timing paths starting at a latch is timed in early mode for setup analysis, and late mode for hold analysis. No CPPR credit is given to the timing path. 
.P When set to false, the behavior is like for any other path. The launch clock path of timing paths starting at a latch is timed in late mode for setup analysis, and early mode for hold analysis. The CPPR credit is given to the path according to the global CPPR settings.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
