.SH Name \fBreport_analysis_coverage\fR \-  Provides information about the timing checks in the design
.SH Syntax \fBreport_analysis_coverage\fR  [-help]  [<pin_port_list>]  [-check_type <check_type_list>]  [-exclude_untested <reason_list>]  [-include_dyn_checks]  [-include_parallel_check_arcs]  [-include_when_cond]  [-max_paths{type <integer>}]  [-nworst <<integer>>]  [-retime {aocv | ssta | path_slew_propagation | aocv_path_slew_propagation}]  [-sort {pin | refpin | checktype | slack | reason}]  [-tcl_list]  [-unsorted]  [-verbose <check_status_list>]  [-view <view_name>]  [> <filename[.gz]>]  [>> <filename[.gz]>] 
.P Provides information about the timing checks in the design. Valid check types are clock_gating_hold, clock_gating_pulse_width, clock_gating_setup, clock_period, clock_separation, external_delay, hold, no_change_hold, no_change_setup, path_delay, pulse_width, recovery, removal, setup, skew, and time_borrow. Valid status types are: met, untested, and violated.
.P For each type of timing check, the command reports the number of checks that meet constraints, violated constraints, or that are untested in the SUMMARY section. The DETAILS section includes information about the signal pin, reference pin, check type, slack, and the reason for being untested.
.P A met check shows as a positive value in the Slack column. A violated check shows as a negative value in the Slack column. An untested check shows as UNTESTED in the Slack column and the reason is given in the Reason column. The Reason column is blank when a Slack number is given because the check has been tested.
.P Note: If there are no timing checks in the design of the type specified by -check_type, the report shows "No timing checks found."
.P Use check_timingto look for missing constraints.

.SH Parameters    "\fB{> | >>}  <file_name>\fR" When specified with >, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.  The <filename>parameter must be the last argument in the list. The <filename> and -tcl_list parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  Note: To write a compressed report, add the
.gz extension to the file name.  Default: Report is displayed on standard output without being saved.  "\fB-check_type <check_type_list>\fR" Limits the report to the type of check(s) in the <check_type_list.>   Default: All (all types of check(s) are reported)  Valid check types are:
.RS  "*" 2 setup: Reports paths with setup timing checks.  "*" 2 hold: Reports paths with hold timing checks.  "*" 2 pulse_width: Reports paths with pulse width timing checks.  "*" 2 clock_period: Reports paths with clock period timing checks.  "*" 2 clock_gating_setup: Reports paths with clock gating setup timing checks.  "*" 2 clock_gating_hold: Reports paths with clock gating hold timing checks.  "*" 2 clock_gating_pulse_width: Reports paths with clock gating pulse width checks.  "*" 2 recovery: Reports paths with recovery timing checks.  "*" 2 removal: Reports paths with removal timing checks.  "*" 2 clock_separation: Reports paths with clock separation timing checks.  "*" 2 skew: Reports paths with skew checks.  "*" 2  data_setup: Reports paths with data to data setup checks.  "*" 2  data_hold: Reports paths with data to data hold checks.
.RE   "\fB-exclude_untested <reason_list>\fR" Excludes from the report endpoints that are unconstrained due to a specific reason.  Valid reasons are:
.RS  "*" 2 const: Constant reaching signal/reference pin of any timing check.  "*" 2 false_path: Path disabled due to set_false_path.  "*" 2 no_endpoint_clock: Missing clock at the reference pin of the timing check.  "*" 2 no_startpoint_clock: Missing clock at the signal pin of the timing check. This may happen if the clock signal does not reach the launching register.  "*" 2 unknown: None of the known reasons are identified for an untested path.  "*" 2 user_disable: Checks arc disable due to set_disable_timing.
.RE   "\fB-include_dyn_checks\fR" Reports the dynamic checks (data_to_data, path_delay) on pins that are constrained by set_data_check, set_max_delay, or set_min_delay constraints. By default, these checks will not be reported and the command only reports the pins constrained by all library checks, set_output_delay or inferred clock gating checks.  The dynamic checks, such as set_data_check or set_max_delay are not reported by default, when -include_dyn_checks parameter is not specified.  "\fB-include_parallel_check_arcs\fR" Reports all the parallel check arcs that have been merged.  "\fB-include_when_cond\fR" Reports the when condition of check arcs.   "\fB-max_paths{type <integer}>\fR" Enumerates the specified number of worst paths in the design, regardless of the endpoint.   "\fB-nworst <integer>\fR" Enumerates the specified number of paths for each endpoint.   "\fB-retime {aocv | ssta | path_slew_propagation | aocv_path_slew_propagation}\fR" Reanalyzes the set of paths using the specified method.   "\fB<pin_port_list>\fR" Limits the report to timing checks on specified pins or ports.  "\fB-sort {pin | refpin | checktype | slack | reason}\fR" Sorts the checks by the specified method while reporting detailed information using the -verbose option. The -sort option does not change the order of the columns.  The criteria by which sorting is attempted for the slack, pin, and checktype arguments is as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 When sorting by slack, if the slack values are the same, the software then attempts to sort the checks by pin name. If the pin names are the same, the software attempts to sort by timing check type.   When you sort by slack, the slack value is reported in order of least negative to most negative (worst slack last).
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When sorting by pin name, if the pin names are the same, the software then attempts to sort the checks by slack value. If the slack values are the same, the software attempts to sort by timing check type.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When sorting by timing check type, if the check types are the same, the software then attempts to sort by slack value. If the slack values are the same, the software attempts to sort by pin name.
.RE   Default: By default, checks are sorted by slack value (slack).
.P Improve usability of the report for debugging purposes by using the -verbose and -sort options as shown in these examples: report_analysis_coverage -verbose untested -sort reason report_analysis_coverage -verbose violated -sort slack  "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Produces the report in Tcl list format instead of a tabular format. This is useful for integrating timing with custom Tcl functions, and also for customizing report generation.  The -tcl_list and <filename>parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  "\fB-unsorted\fR" Reports unsorted slacks with untested end points at the end of the report.  "\fB-verbose <check_status_list>\fR" Limits the detailed information to only the checks with the status specified.  Valid status types are: met, violated, and untested. 
.P Reduce the number of lines in the DETAILS section and improve usability of the report by using the -verbose option to filter out the met checks as shown in this example:   report_analysis_coverage -verbose {violated untested}  Note:  The -verbose parameter supports multi-threading.  "\fB-view <view_name>\fR" Generates a timing check report for the specified analysis view only. You can specify this parameter only when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.
