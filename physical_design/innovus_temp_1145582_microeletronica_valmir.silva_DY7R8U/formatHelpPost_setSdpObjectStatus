.TH setSdpObjectStatus  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsetSdpObjectStatus\fR \-  Sets the placement status of all or specified SDP group/instances
.SH Syntax \fBsetSdpObjectStatus\fR  [-help]   -status {unplaced|placed|fixed|cover}   [-name object_name_list | -all]  
.P Sets the placement status of all or specified SDP group/instances. With setSdpObjectStatus, you can make the placer move or prevent it from moving to adjust placement of SDP elements. For example, if you specify status as unplaced, the command unplaces the data path and moves its boundary outside the die area on the right hand side.
.P Use this command after placement to set SDP status to fixed so other applications will preserve SDP placement (don't touch). Use the setSdpObjectStatus command before running optimization to set SDP placement status to placed so optDesign can further resize instances of SDP.
.P Before setting object status with setSdpObjectStatus, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Imported the design
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Defined the SDP group or instance
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setSdpObjectStatus parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setSdpObjectStatus.  "\fB-all\fR" Changes the placement status of all members of all SDP groups.  Note: If neither -all nor -name is specified, setSdpObjectStatus changes placement status of all SDPs.  "\fB-name <object_name_list>\fR" Specifies the names of SDP groups or instances whose placement status needs to change.  "\fB-status {unplaced|placed|fixed|cover}\fR" Specifies the new placement status. 
.SH Examples
.P The following command changes the placement status of all SDP groups/instances to placed:
.P setSdpObjectStatus -status placed
