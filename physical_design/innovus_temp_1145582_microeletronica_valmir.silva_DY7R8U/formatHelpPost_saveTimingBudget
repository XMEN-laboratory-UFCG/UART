.TH saveTimingBudget  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsaveTimingBudget\fR \-  Saves the previously derived timing budgets to a specified directory
.SH Syntax \fBsaveTimingBudget\fR  [-help]  [-dir <dirName>]  [{<instList>}]  [-inst <string> | -ptn <string>]  [-module_model_tag <string>]
.P Saves the previously derived timing budgets to a specified directory. The main outputs of this command are the block constraints and the timing model. In the MMMC mode, the saveTimingBudget outputs the block and top viewdefinition.tcl as well.
.P Use this command after deriving the time budgets using the deriveTimingBudget command.
.P Note: The software will not write PG information while using the saveTimingBudget command. To get accurate PG information in the partition-block
.lib, run the following commands in sequence:
.P partition  savePartition 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each saveTimingBudget parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command: man saveTimingBudget  "\fB<instList>\fR" Saves the budget files for instances. You use this parameter with the deriveTimingBudget -inst command.  "\fB-dir <dirName>\fR" Specifies the relative directory name where the derived timing budget files will be saved. These files are saved in a sub-directory named cellName_timingViewName.sdc.gz at the dirName/cellName/cellName_timingViewName.sdc.gz location through the relative directory path. If you do not specify this parameter, the timing budget files are saved in the current directory. For example, if you run the following command, a directory named STB will be saved at the current path:  deriveTimingBudget -dir STB  "\fB-inst <instList>| -ptn <ptnList>\fR" Saves the budget file for partitions or instances for which you have generated timing budgets. You do not need to specify -ptn or -inst if you have previously specified deriveTimingBudget -ilm.  The -ptn parameter saves the budget files for partitions. You use this parameter with the deriveTimingBudget -ptn command.  The -inst parameter saves the budget files for instances. You use this parameter with the deriveTimingBudget -inst command.  Default: The tool saves budgets for all instances and partitions specified by deriveTimingBudget.  "\fB-module_model_tag <string>\fR" Creates a new mmmc directory and saves the view definitions, libs, and constraints therein. The created mmmc directory will be located as follows:  <shdb_root>/<block_name>/<tag_name>/mmmc  For example:
.RS  "*" 2 The saveTimingBudget -module_model_tag ABCD command will save view definition, libs, and constraints within the shdb_root/block_name/ABCD/mmmc directory.  "*" 2 The default behavior of the savePartition -module_model_tag ABCD command is not impacted, and the view definition, libs, and constraints are saved in the
.enc.dat file within the shdb_root/block_name/ABCD/pnr directory.  "*" 2 The saveTimingBudget -module_model_tag ABCD and savePartition -module_model_tag ABCD commands are completely independent (those will not affect the functioning of each other).

.SH Examples
.P The following examples are based on a scenario, where a design with the ptn1 partition has two instances, L1 as the master, and L1_clone as the clone:
.RS  "*" 2 The following set of commands saves the timing budget files for partition in the STB/ptn1 directory. It saves the timing budget information for both the partition and top. Also, since it uses the masterOnly mode, the budgets will be based on the master timing only:  deriveTimingBudget -ptn ptn1  saveTimingBudget -dir STB  "*" 2 The following set of commands saves timing budget files only for the L1_clone instance in the STB/ptn1 directory. Since it uses the merged mode, the timing budgeting information will be based on the worst case data from both the instances. In this case, any of the master or clone instances, or both, can be specified while running saveTimingBudget. The best approach is to not specify either of those, and let the saveTimingBudget command save the information generated by the deriveTimingBudget command:  setBudgetingMode -masterClone merged  deriveTimingBudget -inst {L1 L1_clone}  saveTimingBudget -dir STB -inst {L1_clone}  "*" 2 The following set of commands saves the timing budget files for the L1 instance in the STB/ptn1 directory. It saves the timing budget information for only the partition instance:  deriveTimingBudget -inst L1 (or L1_clone)  saveTimingBudget -dir STB  "*" 2 The following set of commands saves the timing budget files for the L1 instance in the STB/ptn1.L1 directory, and for the L1_clone instance in the STB/ptn1.L1_clone directory. It saves the timing budget information only for the partition instances:  deriveTimingBudget -inst {L1 L1_clone}  saveTimingBudget -dir STB  "*" 2 The following set of commands saves the timing budget files only for the L1_clone instance in the STB/ptn1.L1_clone directory:  deriveTimingBudget -inst {L1 L1_clone}  saveTimingBudget -dir STB -inst {L1_clone}
