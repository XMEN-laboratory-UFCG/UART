.P Loads a floorplan file. You can use this command after importing the design.
.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 When you run the loadFPlan command, the Innovus software removes any existing floorplan information and reads in the new information. The loadFPlan command honors the blackbox min/max aspect ratio information in the floorplan information file.  "*" 2 Blocks and instances loaded with this command are set as preplaced.  "*" 2 The loadFPlan command loads the user-specified seed information by default.  "*" 2 The loadFPlan command restores the information related to blockages, tracks, and pin shapes from the *.fp file.

.SH Parameters    "\fB<file>\fR" Specifies the name of the floorplan file that was saved.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each loadFPlan parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man loadFPlan.  "\fB-noEqualizePtnHInst\fR" Disables the snapping capability of the clone partitions to the power grid, such that clones do not necessarily have the same row structure and pattern as their master.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-objType {macro | pin | bndry | special_route | pin_constraint}\fR" Specifies the objects section in the floorplan file that will be updated. The sections can be macro, pin, bndry, special_route, or pin_constraint.  Note: The loadFPlan command supports routing blockages on master slice layers.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-xml\fR" Reads the floorplan information from the XML format floorplan file.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command loads the floorplan file myFPlan.fp, which was saved in an earlier session:  loadFPlan myFPlan.fp  "*" 2 The following command loads only the pin constraints data in the present design with other floorplan objects remaining unchanged.  loadFPlan myFPlan.fp -objType {pin_constraint}
