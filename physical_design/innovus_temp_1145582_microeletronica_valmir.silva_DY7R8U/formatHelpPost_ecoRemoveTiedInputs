.SH Name \fBecoRemoveTiedInputs\fR \-  Remaps or restructures gates that have inputs connected to the same net
.SH Syntax \fBecoRemoveTiedInputs\fR  [-help]  [-base_cells <cell_list>]  [-ignore_base_cells <cell_list>]  [-ignore_insts <inst_list>]   [-insts <inst_list>]  [-relaxed_placement]  [-term <term_list>]  [-verbose]   [-report]
.P Remaps or restructures gates that have inputs connected to the same net. These gates are remapped into functionally equivalent logic such that none of the new gates has inputs tied together. Usually, such optimization is good in all objectives. For example, a 4-input OR gate with 3 of its inputs tied together (implementing function a+b+b+b) can safely be replaced with a 2-input OR gate (implementing a+b). This move is likely to be better in terms of area, power, and delay. However, in case of complex gates, it may not be possible to restructure a gate in a way that improves delay, but it may be possible to decompose it into smaller discrete gates, none of which has inputs tied together. Area and/or delay may be worse, but in some libraries, it is preferable to not have instances with inputs tied together. The ecoRemoveTiedInputs command fixes any gate with two or more inputs connected to the same net regardless of the improvement in delay/area/power. It tries to find improving moves, but it may accept moves that worsen delay/area/power.
.P The command can also insert buffers in nets tying inputs together. Inserting buffers should be used for the gates that cannot be automatically fixed or that are preserved. You need to specify which buffer cell(s) must be inserted before which input(s). There must be as many buffer cells specified as there are inputs specified. The only exception is specifying a single buffer cell; in that case it is understood that all inputs will be untied by using instances of that same buffer cell.
.P The command honors setOptMode settings for timing update and legalization. It does not call ecoRoute if run in the postRoute/ECO stages.
.P Note: MBFF cells are ignored by default as they always have tied inputs.

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each ecoRemoveTiedInputs parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man ecoRemoveTiedInputs  "\fB-base_cells <cell_list>\fR" Specifies the buffer cells to be used for fixing.   "\fB-ignore_base_cells <cell_list>\fR" Specifies to ignore instances of these cells from fixing.   "\fB-ignore_insts <inst_list>\fR" Specifies to ignore these instances from fixing.   "\fB-insts <inst_list>\fR" Specifies to fix only these instances.  Default: All design minus ignored instances/cells.  "\fB-relaxed_placement\fR" Accepts moves even if instances cannot be placed.  You do not need to set this option if ecoRemoveTiedInputs can successfully fix all violations. In some cases, for example if an instance with tied inputs is in a very congested area, the tool may not be able to place the new instances. In such cases, you can use the -relaxed_placement option to fix such instances. However, the final placement may not be legal, and the new instances will likely overlap.  For this, you can perform incremental placement to legalize the placement.  "\fB-term <term_list>\fR" Specifies the terms to be buffered.   "\fB-verbose\fR" Specifies to increase the detail of reports and fixing.  "\fB-report\fR" Reports existing tied inputs, but does not provide fixing details by any method.
