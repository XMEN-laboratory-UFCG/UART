.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each set_abstract_mode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:    man set_abstract_mode  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified options to default value.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-abstract_blockage_cut_around_pin <layer_list>\fR" Specifies that obstruction should be cut around pin for standard cells.  By default, run_abstract creates obstructions on pin shapes.
.RS  "*" 2 If -input_cell_type is std, the default value for -abstract_blockage_cut_around_pin is the list of all metal and via layer names. This means that abstract will not cover obstruction on pins for standard cells on all metal and via layers if -abstract_blockage_cut_around_pin is specified.   "*" 2 If -input_cell_type is block or io, the default value for -abstract_blockage_cut_around_pin is the list of all via layer names. This means that abstract will not cover obstruction on pins for blocks and io pads on all via layers if -abstract_blockage_cut_around_pin is specified. 
.RE   Default: ""  "\fB-antenna_connectivity {<layer1> <connect_layer> <layer2>}\fR" Specifies the layers for which connectivity is to be extracted. The syntax is {<layer1 connect_layer layer2>}.  Example: set_abstract_mode -antenna_connectivity  {{poly V0 M1} {Diff V0 M1}}.  Default: ""  "\fB-antenna_diffusion_geom {{<layer_name>} {<logical_expression>}}\fR" Specifies the diffusion layer, followed by the expression to remove the gate channel area from the diffusion region.  Example: set_abstract_mode -antenna_diffusion_geom  {Diff_real  {Diff andnot Poly}  Default: ""  "\fB-antenna_gate_geom {{<layer_name>} {<logical_expression>}}\fR" Specifies the poly layer that forms a gate along with the layer expression to derive the gate area. This option also triggers the creation of antenna models.  Example: set_abstract_mode -antenna_gate_geom  {{Gate} {Poly and Diff}}  Default: ""  "\fB-blockage_detailed_layers <layer_list>\fR" Specifies the layers for which a detailed blockage model is to be created. The detailed blockage model generates blockages only at those places on the layer where there are real shapes in the cell. This only applies to the IO and block cells and not to standard cells.  Default: "  "\fB-boundary_layers <layer_list>\fR" Specifies the drawn layers to extract the cell boundary. If not specified, abstract uses the prBounbdary object as the boundary size.  By default, <layer_list>list is empty, and the prBoundary is used. The prBoundary comes from an explicit GDS layer that is used to compute the LEF SIZE (and OVERLAP OBS shapes for rectilinear boundaries). If there is no explicit GDS prBoundary layer, the boundary can be computed from the bounding box of geometries on this list of layers.  Note: This option will not normally work for core standard cells because they almost always have diffusion and metal shapes extending outside the real prBoundary. These shapes are usually shared with the row above or below for the power rails. This option can be useful for blocks that have no prBoundary and where a little lost area due to worst-case bounding box approximations is acceptable.  Default: ""  "\fB-cell_symmetry {R0 | X | Y | R90 | X Y | X R90 | Y R90 | X Y R90} \fR" Specifies a property value for cell symmetry. The valid values for the property symmetry are R0, X, Y, R90, X Y, X R90, Y R90, and X Y R90.  Example: set_abstract_mode -cell_symmetry {X Y R90}  Default: {X Y}  "\fB-export_lef_version {5.3 | 5.4 | 5.5 | 5.6 | 5.7 | 5.8}\fR" Specifies the version of LEF to be exported. The default version is the same as the version of the technology LEF file being imported.  Default: 5.7  "\fB-extract_layers_power <layer_list>\fR" Specifies the layers through which the extractor extracts each power net. This is used to reduce the search space if abstract is taking too much run time for each cell.  Usually not applicable to standard cells. For blocks, it is common to only extract the power nets on the top one or two metal layers.  Default: ""  "\fB-extract_layers_signal <layer_list>\fR" Specifies the layers through which the extractor extracts each net. This is used to reduce the search space if abstract is taking too much run time for each cell. Usually not applicable to standard cells.  Default: ""  "\fB-extract_pin_layers_power <layer_list>\fR" Determines the shapes, which are found by the extractor, to be turned into pins. This argument is valid only if the associated layer, geometry specification and connectivity have been provided in the technology LEF. Usually not applicable to standard cells.  Default: ""  "\fB-extract_pin_layers_signal <layer_list>\fR" Determines the shapes, which are found by the extractor, to be turned into pins. This argument is valid only if the associated layer, geometry specification and connectivity have been provided in the technology LEF. Usually not applicable to standard cells.  Default: ""  "\fB-input_cell_type {std | io | block}\fR" Selects the cell type being translated with abstract. The tool adjusts its settings on the basis of the selected cell type.  Default: std  "\fB-input_gds_layer_map_file <file.map>\fR" Specifies the file that maps GDS layer number/data type to LEF layer names in the Virtuoso format.  Default: ""  "\fB-input_lef_tech_file <file.lef>\fR" Specifies the technology LEF file. This is used to get all the layer names and their types, such as routing, cut and the layer order for extracting connectivity.  Default: ""  "\fB-keep_temp_files {true | false}\fR" Specifies to keep the temporary files/libraries that are created in the process after the run_abstract command finishes.  Default: false  "\fB-pins_analog_names <pattern>\fR" Identifies analog  pin names based on label strings in the abstract to set the "USE ANALOG" property of LEF.  "\fB-pins_clock_names <pattern>\fR" Identifies clock pin names based on label strings in the abstract to set the USE CLOCK property of LEF.  "\fB-pins_ground_names <pattern>\fR" Identifies ground pins based on label strings in the abstract to set the USE GROUND property of LEF.  "\fB-pins_output_names <pattern>\fR" Identifies output pins based on label strings in the GDS to set the direction to OUTPUT property of LEF.  "\fB-pins_power_names <pattern>\fR" Identifies power pin names based on label strings in the abstract to set the USE POWER property of LEF.  "\fB-pins_text_pin_map <pattern>\fR" Maps text labels to pins on nets. Specify the layer purpose pairs based on which you want the abstract generator to search for geometry of any given layer-purpose pair with a text label.  "\fB-pre_skill <file.il>\fR" Specifies a skill file that will be executed in abstract before the auto-generated script is executed. Optional.   "\fB-selected_cells <pattern>\fR" Selects cells to create abstract for using regex style expressions.  "\fB-site_name <site_names>\fR" Specifies the site to be used for macros. This site is added to all the cells.   "\fB-verbose {true|false}\fR" Specifies the verbose mode with extra print.  Default: false
