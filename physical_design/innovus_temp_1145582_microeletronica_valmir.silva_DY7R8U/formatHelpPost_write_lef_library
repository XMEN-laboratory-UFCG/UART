.TH write_lef_library  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBwrite_lef_library\fR \-  Writes the LEF library data (composed of technology data and macros) that is present in the Innovus database. 
.P The write_lef_library command facilitates comparisons between LEF-based input and OpenAccess-based input
.SH Syntax \fBwrite_lef_library\fR  [-help]  [<filename>]  [-all_auto_generated_via | -macro_only ]  [-macro_only [-no_property]]  [-tech_only | -macro_only]  [-tech_only | -macro_list <string>] 
.P Writes the LEF library data (composed of technology data and macros) that is present in the Innovus database. 
.P The write_lef_library command facilitates comparisons between LEF-based input and OpenAccess-based input. LEF allows cases where VIARULE GENERATE has WIDTH specified for either the top or bottom layer. However, such cases are not supported by the OpenAccess tech. To make the comparison between LEF-based and OpenAccess-based input easier, write_lef_library dumps "WIDTH 0 TO 1000 ;" for any VIARULE GENERATE that does not have WIDTH specified in the original LEF. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each write_lef_library parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man write_lef_library.  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the output LEF file name.  "\fB-all_auto_generated_via\fR" Includes all auto generated vias from the generateVias command.   "\fB-macro_list <string>\fR" Writes the macros specified in the macro list.   "\fB-macro_only\fR" Writes only the macro data to the LEF file.  "\fB-no_property\fR" Writes data in the LEF file without any properties. This option can be used only with the -macro_only option.   "\fB-tech_only\fR" Writes only the technology data to the LEF file. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command writes the technology data into the tech.lef file:   write_lef_library tech.lef -tech_only  "*" 2 You can set the LEF version to 5.7 or 5.8 using lefDefOutVersion:  set lefDefOutVersion 5.8
