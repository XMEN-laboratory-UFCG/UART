.SH Name \fBget_activity\fR
.SH Syntax \fBget_activity\fR    [-help]  [-instance <<string>>]  [-list_of_nets_based_on_driver <<string>>]  [-list_of_nets_based_on_source_of_activity_info <<string>>]  [-net <<string>>]  [-outfile <<string>>]  [-pin <<string>>]  [-port <<string>>]  [-report_average_switching_activity]  [-report_cell_group_activity_summary_report]   [-summary]  [-tcl_list]
.P Determines the source of activity for the specified nets/pins/ports. The power analysis engine has various sources from where activities can be annotated from, such as switching activity specification (input/sequential/global/clock gate), clock definitions/constants through SDC/TWF, activity files (VCD/TCF/SAF), user defined activity and/or propagated values.
.P Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each get_activity parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man get_activity  "\fB-instance <string>\fR" Specifies the top/hierarchy instance or the leaf level instance name for which average activity is to be reported.   "\fB-list_of_nets_based_on_driver {primary_inputs | sequential | combinational | memory | ICG | black_box}\fR" Specifies to output the list of nets based on the specified net driver.  You can specify one or more net drivers at a time, as shown below:  get_activity -list_of_nets_based_on_driver primary_inputs|combinational| sequential | ICG | memory | black_box   To specify multiple drivers, you can use |(means 'or') or & (means 'and') between two drivers, without a space.  "\fB-list_of_nets_based_on_source_of_activity_info {activity_file|set_switching_activity|propagated|default}\fR" Specifies to output the list of nets based on the specified activity source information.   "\fB-net  <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the net.  Note: You can use the get_nets command to determine the activity source for a collection of nets.  "\fB-outfile <string>\fR" Specifies the output file into which the activity sources are to be written.  "\fB-pin <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the pin.  Note: You can use the get_pins command to determine the activity source for a collection of pins.  "\fB-port <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the port.  Note: You can use the get_ports command to determine the activity source for a collection of ports.  "\fB-report_average_switching_activity\fR" Specifies to report the average activity of the given instance/hierarchy/top-level.   "\fB-report_cell_group_activity_summary_report\fR" Specifies to give a summary of cell group activity.   "\fB-summary\fR" Generates a detailed activity annotation report of the specified nets, pins, and ports. This report contains the following information:
.RS  "*" 2 Primary Inputs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Sequential Outputs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Memory/Macro Outputs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Tristate Outputs
.RE   Note: Use the get_activity -summary command to report activity annotation summary without printing information for nets/pins/ports.  "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Produces the report in the Tcl list format instead of a tabular format.  The -tcl_list and -outfile parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.
