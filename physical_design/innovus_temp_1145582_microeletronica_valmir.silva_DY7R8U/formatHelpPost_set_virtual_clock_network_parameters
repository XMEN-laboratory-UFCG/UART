.SH Name \fBset_virtual_clock_network_parameters\fR \-  Specifies to estimate power for a virtual clock tree
.SH Syntax  \fBset_virtual_clock_network_parameters\fR   [-help]   [-cell <cell_name>]   [-clock <list_of_clocks>]  [-library <library_name>]  [-max_fanout <value>]  [-wire_load_model <wireload_model>]  [-reset] 
.P Specifies to estimate power for a virtual clock tree. When the command is specified, the software reports the power of the clock network based on the buffers inserted in the clock tree. It also reports the number of buffers used for implementing the clock tree and the depth of the clock tree.
.P You can use this command for fast power estimation of clock network power of a pre-CTS netlist.
.P This command should be invoked before running the report_power command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each set_virtual_clock_network_parameters parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man set_virtual_clock_network_parameters.  "\fB-cell <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the buffer or inverter cell that has to be used to build the clock tree.  "\fB-clock <list_of_clocks>\fR" Specifies the list of clocks for which the clock tree needs to be implemented. The default is for all the clocks.  "\fB-library <library_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the library which contains the cell.  "\fB-max_fanout <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum fanout that the buffer cell can drive.  "\fB-wire_load_model <wireload_model>\fR" Specifies the wire load model used to compute the wire load model for the nets in the clock network.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all specified parameters back to default values. 
.SH Example
.P The following command specifies to use the cell BUFX12, with a maximum fanout value of 2, to build a virtual clock tree:
.P set_virtual_clock_network_parameters -cell { BUFX12 } -library typical -max_fanout 2 -wire_load_model B0X0
