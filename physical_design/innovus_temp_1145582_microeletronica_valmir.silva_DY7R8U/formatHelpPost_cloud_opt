.SH Name \fBcloud_opt\fR \-  Provides the ability to optimize chip-level design
.SH Syntax \fBcloud_opt\fR  [-help]   {-preCTS -postCTS}   [-block_type {all flexIlm}]   [-cloud_dir <directory>]   [-cloud_type {sdc lib reverseIlm}]   [-out_dir <directory>]   [-prefix <prefix>]   [-ptn_list <list_of_partitions> | -area {x1 y1 x2 y2} | -top_only  | -block_only ] 
.P Provides the ability to optimize chip-level design. It supports three different optimization methods:
.RS  "*" 2 ReverseILM: It is a model that represents the design of a particular partition block plus the pushed-down top-level clock network and I/O logics path that made up the cloud. With reverseILM technology, tool can make the logic changes inside the partition block but logics that are outside the block design are read-only. The behavior is reverse or opposite to ILM.   "*" 2 Color SDC: It generates SDC for each master/clones, then define a new mode (named with color) to include all the SDCs for master/clones.   "*" 2 Rainbow cloud: It generates new lib and new modes for each master/clones to include more accurate information for optimization 
.RE   Note:  This command is a limited-access feature in this release. It is enabled by a variable specified using the setLimitedAccessFeature command. To use this feature, contact your Cadence representative to explain your usage requirements, and make sure this feature meets your needs before deploying it widely. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each cloud_opt parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man cloud_opt  "\fB{-preCTS -postCTS}\fR" Specifies the optDesign stage.  Data_type: enum, required  "\fB-area {x1 y1 x2 y2}\fR" Specifies area coordinates for area optimization.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-block_only\fR" Optimizes at the block-level only.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-block_type {all flexIlm}\fR" Specifies the block model type. By default, full block-level netlist will be used for the top-level optimization. Otherwise, the flexILM model will be used.  Default: all  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-cloud_dir <directory> \fR" Specifies the directory to save the cloud opt data.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-cloud_type {sdc lib reverseIlm} \fR" Specifies the cloud model type. Use sdc, lib, or reverseIlm for color SDC, rainbow cloud, or reverseIlm optimization techniques, respectively.  Default: lib  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-out_dir <directory>\fR" Specifies the directory to save the report file.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-prefix <prefix> \fR" Specifies the prefix for the report file.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-ptn_list <list_of_partitions>  \fR" Specifies the list of partition names that will be optimized at their block-level designs before optimizing the top-level design.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-top_only\fR" Optimizes at the top-level only.  Data_type: bool, optional
