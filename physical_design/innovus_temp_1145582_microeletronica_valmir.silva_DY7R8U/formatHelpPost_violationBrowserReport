.SH Name \fBviolationBrowserReport\fR \-  Reports violations flagged by the verification commands
.SH Syntax \fBviolationBrowserReport\fR  [-help]   [-all]   [-aclimit]   [-connectivity]   [-density]   [-geometry]  [-max_error_per_type <integer]>  [-no_display_false]   [-overlap]   [-process_antenna]   [-short]   [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]   [-report <filename>]   [-filter <filterString>]   [-filter_mode {AND | OR | NOT}]  [-search_desc]  
.P Reports violations flagged by the verification commands. The report file and violation browser list the violations in the same order. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each violationBrowserReport parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man violationBrowserReport  "\fB-aclimit\fR" Reports AC limit violations.  "\fB-all\fR" Reports all violations.  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the area for which to report violations. For example, violationBrowserReport -area {0 0 100 100}.  "\fB-connectivity\fR" Reports connectivity violations.  "\fB-density\fR" Reports metal density violations.  "\fB-filter <filterString>\fR" Specifies a text string in the violation message (in the bottom portion of the Violation Browser). When you specify a text string, the Violation Browser searches the message of each violation and displays only the violations whose messages match the search conditions.  To specify a list of strings, separate each string with a space.  To specify a literal string with space in it, enclose the string in double quotation marks. For example, you can specify strings such as the following:
.RS  "*" 2 METAL5
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 (600, 500)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 METAL3 (700, 400)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 "Pin of Net"
.RE   "\fB-filter_mode {AND | OR | NOT}\fR" Specifies the condition for searching multiple strings in the violation browser. You cannot filter complex expressions because the AND, OR, and NOT parameters are mutually exclusive.
.RS  "*" 2 The AND and OR conditions work on single strings or multiple strings.  "*" 2 The NOT condition works only on a single string. 
.RE   "\fB-geometry\fR" Reports geometry violations.   "\fB-max_error_per_type <integer>\fR" Specifies the error marker number limit for each type of error.  Specifies a limit for the number of violations parsed for each violation type. For example, if you set violationBrowserReport -max_error_per_type 500, the Violation Browser parses and displays only 500 markers per error type in the report. Use this parameter if you are loading a large DRC file with millions of violations to prevent the database from becoming slow while loading the file and to limit the number of violations you review in the browser.  By default, the Violation Browser displays  all  markers in the report.  "\fB-no_display_false\fR" Prohibits the Innovus software from displaying false violations.  "\fB-overlap\fR" Reports overlap violations.  "\fB-process_antenna\fR" Reports process antenna violations.  "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the report file for the violation information.  Type: String  "\fB-search_desc\fR" Searches the description field for each marker in addition to the table entries.  "\fB-short\fR" Reports short violations. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reports all violations whose marker title contains METAL3:
.RE
.P violationBrowserReport -all -filter METAL3
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reports geometry violations whose marker title contains METAL3 or tdsp:
.RE
.P violationBrowserReport -geometry -filter {METAL3 tdsp} -filter_mode OR
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reports geometry violations whose marker title or marker description field contains Min and 0.24 and METAL3:
.RE
.P violationBrowserReport -geometry -filter {Min 0.24 METAL3} -filter_mode AND -search_desc
