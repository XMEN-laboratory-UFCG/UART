.SH Name \fBset_aocv_stage_weight\fR
.SH Syntax \fBset_aocv_stage_weight\fR  <stage_weight>  <port_list>   [-early]  [-late]  [-input]  [-output] 
.P While performing advanced on-chip variation (AOCV) analysis of a block in standalone mode, the command allows you to specify the stage weight seen at the port(s) when it is modeled as part of the top level design. The applied stage weights affect the internal weight count of the block for the IO paths. The stage weights can be applied only on ports.
.P You can view stage weights in the report_timing output under the Stage Weighting column.
.P The set_aocv_stage_weight command can be used in multi-mode multi-corner mode. The command can be used as part of SDC file. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-early\fR" Specifies weight for early paths.  "\fB-input\fR" Specifies input weight for the ports.  "\fB-late\fR" Specifies weight for late paths.  "\fB-output\fR" Specifies output weight for port.  "\fB<port_list>\fR" Specifies a list or collection of input, output, and bidi ports.  "\fB<stage_weight>\fR" Specifies value of stage weight. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following example specifies the stage weight value as 25.5 for port out0:   set_aocv_stage_weight 25.5 out0
