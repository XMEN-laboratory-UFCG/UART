.SH Name \fBset_clock_latency\fR \-  Specifies ideal internal clock latency and external clock arrival delay
.SH Syntax \fBset_clock_latency\fR  [-source [-early | -late]]   [-rise]  [-fall]   [-jitter <jitter_val>]  [-clock <clock_list>]  [-min]  [-max]  [-clock_gate]   <latency>  <pin_or_clock_list> 
.P Specifies ideal internal clock latency and external clock arrival delay.
.P Clock latency has two components:
.RS  "*" 2 Source latency:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Specified using the -source parameter and is the delay from the external clock generator to the clock port of the design.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Applied when the clock is either ideal or propagated.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 set_clock_latency set on a clock port has higher precedence than set_clock_latency set on a clock waveform.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Specified on clock waveforms with both the set_input_delay command and the set_output_delay command.
.RE 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Network latency (clock tree delay):
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Default latency type and is the delay from the clock port to the register.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Applied only when the clock is ideal. When the clock is propagated, this delay is replaced by the actual clock tree delays.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Specified on a clock waveform or a clock port is ignored if the clock is propagated.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 set_clock_latency set on a timing pin has higher precedence than set_clock_latency set on a waveform.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 If there are multiple set_clock_latency and set_propagated_clock assertions between the clock waveform, clock root and clock endpoint, the closest assertion to the clock endpoint takes precedence.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Specified on internal circuit pins or hierarchical ports and used in the fanout cone of the network latency pin, when a clock is ideal.
.RE 
.RE
.P Use the set_clock_latency command in two ways:
.RS  "*" 2 To specify clock latency for a clock waveform:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following syntax for source latency associated with a clock signal:   set_clock_latency [-source] [-early | -late] [-min ][-max]<latency><pin_or_clock_list>
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following syntax for network latency associated with a clock signal:   set_clock_latency [-min] [-max]<latency><pin_or_clock_list>
.RE 
.RE
.P You cannot specify the -late and -early parameters for network latency.  Specifying latency on a port or pin overrides any previous latency specified on the port pin or waveform. The <pin_or_clock_list> argument is the list of the clock waveform names as specified by the create_clock command.
.RS  "*" 2 To specify clock latency on clock pins:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following syntax for source delay on a clock port:   set_clock_latency -source [-early | -late] [-rise] [-fall]  <insertion_delay><pin_or_clock_list>
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following syntax for network delay on a clock pin:   set_clock_latency [-min] [- max] [-rise] [-fall]  <insertion_delay>-pin <pin_or_clock_list>
.RE 
.RE
.P When a clock is ideal, the last specification along a path is used. This is useful when you want to intentionally skew the clock tree and model the physical hierarchical clock tree. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-clock <clock_list>\fR" Associates clock latency constraints, placed at the pin level, with a specific clock. This makes it possible to specify a different latency per clock.  Note: You cannot use the -clock parameter with clock waveform objects.  "\fB-clock_gate\fR" Allows setting the local clock latency value on pin or port objects. This setting overwrites the existing latency value of clock gating cells and is used when performing timing checks against the specified pins or ports.   "\fB-early |  -late\fR" Specifies clock arrival time with respect to the early or the late time of the clock signal. In setup analysis, launch path is the late path and capture path is the early path. In hold analysis, launch path is the early path and the capture path is the late path. If neither parameter is specified, the default is both early and late. Use these parameters only with the -source parameter. You cannot use these parameters with network latency. Specify the clock latency at the given operating corner.  Note: The -min and -max parameters refer to the operating corner and the -early and -late parameters refer to the clock arrival time at the source. Use the -early and -late parameters with the -source parameter to specify the four different clock latencies.  "\fB-jitter <jitter_val>\fR" Specifies the portion of source clock latency value that can have cycle-to-cycle variation.  When calculating  CPPR  adjustment this portion is removed from  CPPR  adjustment for different  clock edge checks (e.g., setup), but it remains as part of cppr adjustment for same clock edge checks (e.g., hold).  "\fB<latency>\fR" Specifies the value of the latency, in library units, as a floating point.  "\fB<pin_or_clock_list>\fR" Specifies a list of clock waveform names or a list of pins to associate with the clock latency. The pin can be a port or an instance pin.  Setting source latency on a pin is ignored.  "\fB-max\fR" Specifies the clock latency for a particular operating corner. Apply the -max parameter to the maximum operating corner.  "\fB-min\fR" Specifies the clock latency for a particular operating corner. Apply the -min parameter to the minimum operating corner.  "\fB-rise/ -fall\fR" Specifies the -rise or -fall parameter to the waveform at register clock pins for ideal latency and to the waveform at the source for source latency. Ideal network latency does not change polarity when crossing negative unate arcs.  "\fB-source\fR" Specifies a source latency. If you do not specify the -source parameter, network latency is applied. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following set of commands enable you to create a clock using the create_clock command and apply latency to the created clock using the set_clock_latency command:   create_clock CLK2 -period 20 [get_ports {clkA clkB clkD}]  set_clock_latency -source 2 {clkB clkD} # Define port settings  set_clock_latency -rise 5 {clkB clkD} # Define port settings  set_clock_latency -early -late -source CLK1 # Define waveform settings  set_clock_latency 3 -early -late -source CLK1 # Define waveform settings
