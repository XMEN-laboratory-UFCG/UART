.SH Name \fBtiming_use_latch_time_borrow\fR \-  When set to false, does not consider time borrowing during timing analysis
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_use_latch_time_borrow\fR  {true | false}  Default: true
.P When set to false, does not consider time borrowing during timing analysis. Time borrowing is the amount of time borrowed by a previous logic. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command. 
.P Note: The timing_use_latch_time_borrow global should not be used with the setAnalysisMode command. Use this global only when the setAnalysisMode command is not available. When the setAnalysisMode command is available, use the -timeBorrowing parameter to control time borrowing consideration.
