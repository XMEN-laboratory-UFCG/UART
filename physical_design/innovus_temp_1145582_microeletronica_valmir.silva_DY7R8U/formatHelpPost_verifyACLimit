.SH Syntax \fBverifyACLimit\fR  [-help]

.P In addition, verifyACLimit can be used for average current limit (Iavg) analysis.
.P AC current limit violations are sometimes also referred as wire self-heat violations. DRC manuals have these current limits to avoid over-heating a signal-net wire with too much AC current. To prevent wire self-heating or AC signal electromigration, signal interconnects should be analyzed for their AC current carrying capacity and measured against the AC current limits specified by foundry.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyACLimit parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man verifyACLimit
