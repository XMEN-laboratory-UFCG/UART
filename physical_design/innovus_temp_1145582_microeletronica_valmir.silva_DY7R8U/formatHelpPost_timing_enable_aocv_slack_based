.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_aocv_slack_based\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_enable_aocv_slack_based\fR {0 | 1}
.P Default: 0
.P Enables AOCV analysis using slack-based method.
.P When set to true, the software will try to remove excess pessimism from the graph-based analysis (GBA) AOCV stage counts. The paths to endpoints, which are under the specified slack criteria (default 0.0 ns), are considered when computing stage counts. This allows the stage counts and subsequent AOCV derates to be aligned with the failing paths - and not unnecessarily punished by derates coming from related short paths that meet timing requirements.
.P Note: A true setting is recommended when performing Setup optimizations in Innovus - where over pessimism can cause sub-optimal results.
.P See timing_aocv_slack_threshold.
.P To use this global variable, use the set command.
