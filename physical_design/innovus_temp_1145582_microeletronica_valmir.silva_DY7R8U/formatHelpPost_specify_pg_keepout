.SH Parameters    "\fB-bottom <value>\fR" Specifies the value to expand the keepout box on the bottom side.   "\fB-cell <lib_cell_name>\fR" Specifies the lib cell that needs to be constrained by the PG keepout box.  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each specify_pg_keepout parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man specify_pg_keepout    "\fB-inst <instance_name>\fR" Specifies the instance that needs to be constrained by the PG keepout box.  "\fB-layer <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the layer on which the PG keepout box is applied. The layer is the LEF/OA name of routing layers.  "\fB-layerId <layer_id>\fR" Specifies the layer Ids on which the PG keepout box is applied. The layer Id is the layer number of routing layers.    "\fB-left <value>\fR" Specifies the value to expand the keepout box on the left side.   "\fB-pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the pin that needs to be constrained by the PG keepout box.   "\fB-right <value>\fR" Specifies the value to expand the keepout box on the right side.   "\fB-top <value>\fR" Specifies the value to expand the keepout box at the top. 
.SH Example
.P The following command keeps mycustomcell/the_m4_pin away from M5 power stripes:
