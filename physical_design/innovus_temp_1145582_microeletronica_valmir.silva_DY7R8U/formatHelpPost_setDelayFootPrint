.SH Name \fBsetDelayFootPrint\fR \-  Specifies the delay cell footprint
.SH Syntax \fBsetDelayFootPrint\fR  [-help]  [-library <libName>]  <names> 
.P Specifies the delay cell footprint. This footprint name is usually assigned during design import. The delay cells from the cell footprint name are used for inserting delays when you run timing optimization to fix hold-time violations. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each setDelayFootPrint parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man setDelayFootPrint  "\fB-library <libName>\fR" Specifies the library name from where the cells will be picked up.   "\fB<names>\fR" Specifies the delay cell footprint name or a delay cell name. When you specify a delay cell name, the Innovus software automatically finds the cell footprint name. 
.SH Example
.P The following command sets the delay footprint name to DEL_1P:
.P setDelayFootPrint DEL_1P
