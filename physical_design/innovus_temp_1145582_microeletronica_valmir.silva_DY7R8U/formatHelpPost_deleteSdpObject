.SH Name \fBdeleteSdpObject\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBdeleteSdpObject\fR  [-help]   {-object <object_name_list> [-keepCellPlacement ] | -obstruct <group_name_list> | -emptyRow <instance_name> [-numRow <value>]} 
.P Deletes one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 SDP group(s) or element(s)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 A placement blockage associated with the specified SDP group(s)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Empty row(s) adjacent to the specified instance
.RE
.P Use the deleteSdpObject command to modify structure of existing data path(s) easily and to remove existing SDP groups or elements. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each deleteSdpObject parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man deleteSdpObject.  "\fB-emptyRow  <instance_name>\fR" Deletes the empty row(s) adjacent to the specified instance based on the justifyBy constraint of the group to which the instance belongs. If the group is justified by SW/SE, the empty rows below the specified instance are deleted. If the group is justified by NW/NE, the empty rows above the specified instance are deleted.  Note:  If the rows adjacent to the specified instances are not empty, an error message is returned.  "\fB-keepCellPlacement\fR" Preserves the cell placement of remaining SDP members when an SDP object is deleted. If this parameter is not specified, deleteSdpObject unplaces all SDP members while deleting the specified SDPs. This option can be used only with  -object.   "\fB-numRow <value>\fR" Indicates the number of empty rows to be deleted.  Note:  If this parameter is not specified, one empty row is deleted by default.  "\fB-object <object_name_list>\fR" Deletes the specified SDP group or instance. If you want to delete more than one object, enclose the object names in {}.  "\fB-obstruct  <group_name_list>\fR" Deletes the placement blockage over the specified SDP group(s).
