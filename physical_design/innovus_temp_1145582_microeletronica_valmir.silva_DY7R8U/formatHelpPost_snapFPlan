.SH Name \fBsnapFPlan\fR \-  Snaps floorplan objects to the grid. You can use this command after importing the design

.P Snaps floorplan objects to the grid. You can use this command after importing the design.
.P Note: Innovus honors the FinFET grid and automatically checks for the FinFET definition. If it detects a FinFET definition, it enables support and sets the placement grid as FinFET grid by default. Since the height of all placeable objects must be a multiple of FinFET grid and the origin of these objects must be snapped to the FinFET grid. The snapFPlan command is used to snap blocks, I/O pads, standard cells to the FinFET grid.  It honors user specified snapping rule for x direction. For y direction, it honors the FinFET grid (when the FinFET grid is horizontal in regular horizontal row design). 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-all\fR" Specifies the snapping of all supported object types.  Data_type: bool, required  "\fB-areaIo\fR" Specifies the snapping of I/O cells.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-block\fR" Specifies the snapping of floorplan blocks.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-guide\fR" Specifies the snapping of floorplan guides, regions, and fences.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each snapFPlan parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:     man snapFPlan  "\fB-ioPad\fR" Specifies the snapping of I/O pads.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-macroPin\fR" Specifies the snapping of macro pins to the correct color track.   Note: The snapFPlan command only snaps signal pins and places a macro with macro pins on color track. Innovus snaps the port on the lowest metal layer which is close to macro origin to the color track.   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pin\fR" Specifies the snapping of pins.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pinBlk\fR" Specifies the snapping of pin blockages.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pinGuide\fR" Specifies the snapping of pin guides.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-placeBlk\fR" Specifies the snapping of placement blockages.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-ptnCore\fR" Specifies the snapping of the partition core.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-routeBlk\fR" Specifies the snapping of routing blockages.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-selected\fR" Specifies the snapping of all supported object types that are selected in the design display area.  Data_type: bool, required  "\fB-stdCell\fR" Specifies the snapping of standard cells.  Data_type: bool, optional
