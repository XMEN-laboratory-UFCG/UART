.TH set_dynamic_power_simulation  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_dynamic_power_simulation\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBset_dynamic_power_simulation\fR  [-help]  [-period <value>]  [-resolution <value>]  [-reset]  [-activity_pattern {<time1> <activity_name1> <time2> <activity_name2>
.... }] 
.P Specifies the period and resolution for a dynamic power simulation. This command is used to specify the simulation period in the dynamic vectorbased/vectorless and power-up flows.
.P Generally, the number of simulation steps (simulation period divided by resolution) should be selected such that the number is around 1000. Around 20 clock cycles of the dominant clock specified as period and 20/50ps specified as resolution will capture all switching events in the design. This can be fine-tuned to balance the run time and accuracy. For example, if the dominant clock frequency is 1GHz, and the clock period is 1ns, the recommended simulation period is 20ns and resolution is 20ps, as shown in the following example:
.P set_dynamic_power_simulation -period 20ns -resolution 20ps
.P In this case, the number of simulation steps is 1000. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each set_dynamic_power_simulation parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man set_dynamic_power_simulation.  "\fB-activity_pattern {<time1> <activity_name1> <time2> <activity_name2>
.... }\fR" Divides the total simulation time based on the windows given in the activity_pattern parameter. For a particular window, it uses the defined activity specified with the set_default_switching_activity command.  When the user-defined low cycle and high cycle time is specified for the input/sequential activity, all the clocks will be in the low or high cycle until completely past the cycle transition time.  Following is the use model of this parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 set_default_switching_activity -name low -input_activity 0.05 -seq_activity 0.1 -clock_gates_output 0.2  "*" 2 set_default_switching_activity -name high -input_activity 0.1 -seq_activity 0.2 -clock_gates_output 2.0
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 set_dynamic_power_simulation -period 15ns -resolution 50ps -activity_pattern {0 high 5ns low 10ns high}
.RE   Here, high activity is used for 0ns to 5ns, low activity is used for 5ns to 10ns, and high activity is used for 10ns to 15ns.  "\fB-period <value>\fR" Specifies the simulation period that dynamic power analysis will use. The supported time units are s, ms, us, ns, and ps. If no explicit time unit is specified, the default ns (nanosecond) will be applied.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all specified options back to default values.  "\fB-resolution <value>\fR" Specifies the transient time step size or resolution. The supported time units are s, ms, us, ns, and ps. If no explicit time unit is specified, the default ps (picosecond) will be applied.
