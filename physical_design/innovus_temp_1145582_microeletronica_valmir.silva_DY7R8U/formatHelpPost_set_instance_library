.SH Name \fBset_instance_library\fR \-  Binds a cell library to an instance
.SH Syntax \fBset_instance_library\fR    [-help]   -library <string>   -instance <string>   [-early | -late]
.P Binds a cell library to an instance. When specified, the software overrides the default binding mechanism for a cell from the library set.
.P Note: The set_instance_library command cannot be used at the command prompt - this command can be specified in the ViewDefinition file.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help    \fR" Prints out the command usage.  "\fB-early\fR" Uses the library binding for early timing analysis.  "\fB-instance <string>\fR" Specifies the instance for which the library binding needs to be done.  "\fB-late\fR" Uses the library binding for late timing analysis.  "\fB-library <string>\fR" Specifies the library file path. 
.SH Examples
.P The following commands specify the instance for which the library binding will be done:
.RS  "*" 2 set_instance_library -library newcell.lib -instance {i1}  "*" 2 set_instance_library -library mysil.lib -instance {i1 i2}  "*" 2 set_instance_library -library {new.lib mysil.lib} -instance {i1} -early  "*" 2 set_instance_library -library {mynew.lib mysil.lib} -instance {i1 i2} -late
