.P Type: String
.P Default: fv/invs/%s
.P Specifies the directory name where the write_do_lec command will write verification files when the write_lec_files global is true. The directory will be created if it does not already exist, and will be overwritten if the existing directory has the same name. A %s in the string is replaced with the design name. For example, it will overwrite the directory for the same design but not for a different design. A %d in the string is replaced with a unique integer to avoid overwriting any existing directory.
