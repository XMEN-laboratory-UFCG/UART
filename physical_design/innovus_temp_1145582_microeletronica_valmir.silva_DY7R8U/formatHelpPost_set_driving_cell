.SH Name \fBset_driving_cell\fR \-  Models the drive capability of an external driver connected to the input port
.SH Syntax \fBset_driving_cell\fR  [-library <library_name>]   -lib_cell <cell_name>  [-pin <pin_name>]   [-from_pin <from_pin_name>]   [-rise]   [-fall]   [-min]   [-max]   [-multiply_by <factor>]   [-no_design_rule]  [-input_transition_rise <rise_slew_value>]   [-input_transition_fall <fall_slew_value>]   <port_list> 
.P Models the drive capability of an external driver connected to the input port. Use this command only for timing analysis. The command does not affect the electrical properties of the design, which means that the capacitance of the output pin of the driving cell does not add to the total capacitance of the input port.
.P To model the drive capability of the external driver, the timing analyzer computes an offset to the arrival time of an input, and changes the slew time used to compute the delay for the next cell. The timing analyzer computes the offset by subtracting the zero load delay from the total delay of the cell. The set_driving_cell command uses the offset value to identify a cell from the library to drive the specified input port(s).
.P This command overrides the set_drive command per port or per net, if it is the last command applied. Also, if the set_driving_cell command is set for a port, the set_input_transition command is ignored for that port. If you do not define drive using the set_driving_cell command, the software uses the default value defined in the configuration file. The default value is 0.1ps. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-fall\fR" Annotates only the falling drive assertion. The default is to annotate both rise and fall delays.  "\fB-from_pin <from_pin_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the input port of the driver cell that has an arc to the output port of the driver cell, which is connected to the input port of the design. This option is required only if there are multiple timing arcs in the driver cell from its input ports to its output ports, and the arcs from those pins have different drive characteristics.  If you do not specify the -from_pin option, the default is to use the first timing arc found on the library cell.  "\fB-input_transition_fall <fall_slew_value>\fR" Specifies the slew value for the falling signal at the input of the drive cell.  "\fB-input_transition_rise <rise_slew_value>\fR" Specifies the slew value for the rising signal at the input of the drive cell.  "\fB-lib_cell <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the driver cell. This parameter supports wildcard patterns and collections.  "\fB-library <library_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the library that contains the driving cell.  "\fB-max\fR" Annotates only the late drive assertion. The default is to annotate both early and late.  "\fB-min\fR" Annotates only the early drive assertion. The default is to annotate both early and late.  "\fB-multiply_by <factor>\fR" Specifies a multiplier for the drive.   "\fB-no_design_rule\fR" Does not allow transfer of design rules from the driving cell to the port.  If you do not specify this option, the design rules (such as max_capacitance) of the library pin are applied to the port.  "\fB-pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the output port of the driver cell that drives the signal at the input port of the design. This option is required if there are multiple output ports on the driver. If there is only one output port on the driver cell, then using this option is not necessary.  "\fB<port_list>\fR" Specifies the list of ports driven by the driver cell.  "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies only the rising drive assertion is annotated.The default is to annotate both rise and fall delays. 
.SH Examples
.P The following command sets 'AND' cell (arc B -> Y) as the driving cell for the input port IN1:  set_driving_cell -lib_cell AND -from_pin B -pin Y IN1
