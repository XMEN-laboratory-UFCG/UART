.TH createInterfaceLogic  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreateInterfaceLogic\fR \-  Creates the specified directory containing ILM files with the appropriate level of extraction for specific model type such as timing, si, or for all models
.SH Syntax \fBcreateInterfaceLogic\fR  [-help]  [-allowIlmEco]  [-ignorePorts <ListOfPorts>]   [-keepAll][-keepSelected]   [-modelType {timing si all}]  [-noInterClockPath]  [-overwrite]  [-removePowerGround]   [-dir <dirName> | -cellview {lib | cell | view}]   [ [-optStage {preCTS postCTS}] ]
.P Creates the specified directory containing ILM files with the appropriate level of extraction for specific model type such as timing, si, or for all models. For MMMC, ILM models will be generated based on constraint modes.
.P The createInterfaceLogic command creates a reduced set of instances representing only the interface paths, that is, paths from the I/O ports of the design to the first level of sequential instances (latches are considered sequential elements).
.P The command automatically modifies the module name with the following rule:
.P topModuleName+timestamp+$+moduleName 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each createInterfaceLogic parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man createInterfaceLogic  "\fB-allowIlmEco\fR" Allows ECO changes within the ILM block.   "\fB-cellview {lib | cell | view}\fR" Specifies OA cell view information for generated ILMs.    The -cellview option cannot be used in non-OA flow. For non-OA flow, you use the -dir option instead.  "\fB-dir <dirName>\fR" Specifies the output directory name where ILMs file will be saved. If the design is not an OA design, this option must be specified.  "\fB-keepAll\fR" Preserves the complete logic of block and hence does not do any logic pruning based on constraints or path groups.  Note: Since the complete logic is preserved, so all the ILM views, that is, timing, CTS, and SI share the same model data.  "\fB-ignorePorts <ListOfPorts>\fR" Specifies list of ports where these ports and the associated interface path(s) which are starting or ending at these ports will not be included in the ILM model.  "\fB-keepSelected\fR" Preserves all selected instances and nets (in addition to those normally kept) when you create ILMs. Selected instances are those instances that drive the selected nets. You can select instances or nets using the selectInst or selectNet commands, then use createInterfaceLogic -keepSelected.  By default, no additional instances and nets are preserved.  "\fB-modelType {timing | si | all}\fR" Specifies the type of ILM model to be created.  Default: all
.RS  "*" 2 all: Ensures that all models are written.  "*" 2 timing: Ensures that only the timing model is written for non-SI based timing, optimization, or clock tree commands.  "*" 2 si: Ensures that only the SI model is written that can be used for the SI based timing and optimization commands.
.RE   "\fB-noInterClockPath\fR" Minimizes the clock latency at the upper-level CTS when the non-boundary flop in ILM has the maximum clock latency.   "\fB-optStage {preCTS | postCTS}\fR" Specifies the optimization stage, preCTS or postCTS.  This option should be specified both for ILM and flexILM creation.  "\fB-overwrite\fR" Overwrites existing files.   "\fB-removePowerGround\fR" Removes PG ports, PG nets, PG pin connections, and replaces PG net connections on signal pins with 1'b1 or 1'b0
. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates both timing model and SI model in directory BlockA:    createInterfaceLogic -dir BlockA
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command only generates timing model and saves it in directory BlockA:    createInterfaceLogic -dir BlockA -modelType timing
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command completely replaces the library, cell and view in an OA flow.  createInterfaceLogic -cellview {lib | cell | view} -overwrite 
.RE
.P Note:  In the current ILM flow, SDC constraints originally specified against the complete flat netlist for the design get filtered when being applied against the ILM view of the design.
.P Note: The setIlmMode command settings also affect the instances that createInterfaceLogic command will preserve to model the block.
.P Sample Summary Report
.P The following is a sample summary report generated at the end of the createInterfaceLogic command:
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P In this report, the reduction ratio in the ilm_data model is 93 percent which means that 7153 out the total 7621 instances for this block have been eliminated. Only 468 instances are written to the Verilog netlist for the ilm_data model out of which 111 instances are registers.
.P This summary report applies to a block using MMMC. Therefore, views with worst reduction ratio are displayed for each model.
