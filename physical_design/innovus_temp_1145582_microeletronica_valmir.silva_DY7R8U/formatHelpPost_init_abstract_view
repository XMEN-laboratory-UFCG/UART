.SH Name \fBinit_abstract_view\fR
.SH Syntax \fBinit_abstract_view\fR <list_of_views> 
.P Type: String
.P Default: abstract
.P Specifies the OpenAccess view names that the tool should examine to find the equivalent LEF MACRO information (for example, PINS, OBS, FOREIGN). If this value is null (""), the tool uses abstract as the value. The init_abstract_view variable replaces the previous rda_Input(ui_oa_abstractname) configuration file variable.
.P The init_abstract_view is used in combination with init_oa_ref_lib and in the case where a Verilog netlist is read and views from the init_abstract_view list are used for on-demand loading for cells that were not processed from the libraries in the init_oa_ref_lib list. It is used by the init_design command. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets ABS1 as the OpenAccess view to be examined for equivalent LEF MACRO information.   set init_abstract_view {ABS1}
