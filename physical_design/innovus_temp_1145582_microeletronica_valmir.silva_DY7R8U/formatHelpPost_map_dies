.SH Name \fBmap_dies\fR \-  A utility to generate the inter die data mapping file based on the design stack configuration file and die ploc files
.SH Syntax  \fBmap_dies\fR  [-help]  -3dic_design_stack_file< filename>  [-component_config_file<filename>]  [-die_pad_file_pair {{<<die_name1>> <<pad file1>>} {<<die_name1>> <<pad file2>>}...}]  [-map_search_distance <distance>]  [-mode sanity_check]  [-output <directory>]  [-stacked_die_mapping <filename>] 
.P A utility to generate the inter die data mapping file based on the design stack configuration file and die ploc files. This mapping file is required if there is a direct connection between dies. The generated mapping file defines the connection between dies (between interposer and logic die). This mapping file is then specified with the set_multi_die_analysis_mode -stacked_die_mapping command for multi-die analysis. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.   "\fB-3dic_design_stack_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the XML file containing the design stack information. This file is from the Integrity 3D-IC product. It includes each die's tier level (Z direction), die instance name, size (post shrink size if there is a scale factor), flip, rotation (counter, clockwise), placement location, and contact layer.   "\fB-component_config_file<filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the design configuration file. This file is used to define the power pad location files, and the power and ground net names.  File Format:  COMPONENT IDIE   Power_pad { {ldie_VDD.ploc VDD_AO} {ldie_VSS.ploc VSS} }   [Power_net { VDD_AO}]   [Ground_net {VSS}]   END   COMPONENT LDIE   Power_pad { {ldie_ALL.ploc all} }   [Power_net {VDD1}]   [Ground_net {VSS2}]   END  "\fB-die_pad_file_pair {{<<die_name1>> <<pad file1>>} {<<die_name1>> <<pad file2>>}...} \fR" Specifies the mapping between die instance names and their corresponding power pad file for the interposer die and logic dies.  "\fB-map_search_distance <distance>\fR" Specifies the legal mapping distance range between the interposer and legal dies. The unit for distance is micrometer (um).   "\fB-mode sanity_check\fR" Specifies to perform sanity checks for the generated mapping file.   "\fB-output <directory>\fR" Specifies the output directory containing the mapping results. The output folder contains the generated mapping file (die_die.map).   The format of the 6-column mapping file is:  IDIE_INST_NAME(idie_inst_name) Inet_name Ibump_name LDIE_INST_NAME(ldie_inst_name) Lnet_name Lbump_name  Here,
.RS  "*" 2 The first 3 columns are for the interposer die instance name, net name, and bump name(vsrc name), and the last 3 columns are for the logic die instance name, net name, and bump name.  "*" 2 The die instance names are written in upper case that is followed by the die instance names specified in the rail TCL for each die instance name.  "*" 2 The file is split in two sections, POWER and GROUND.
.RE   "\fB-stacked_die_mapping <filename>\fR" Specifies the mapping file used to define the connection between dies (between interposer and logic die). This file provides the information on bump-to-bump mapping (one bump from interposer die and the other bump from logic die) to provide logical connectivity.   The format of the 6-column mapping file is:  IDIE VDD_AO BUMP_PWR_1 LDIE1 VDD_AO LDIE_PWR_BUMP7  IDIE VDD_AO BUMP_PWR_2 LDIE1 VDD_AO LDIE_PWR_BUMP8 
...  Here, the first 3 columns are for the interposer die instance name, net name, and bump name, and the last 3 columns are for the logic die instance name, net name, and bump name. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command generates a mapping file that includes the connection between dies (between interposer die INTERPOSER and logic dies DIE0, DIE1, DIE2, DIE3):  map_dies \\  -output results \\  -3dic_config_file
../data/design_stack.xml \\  -die_pad_file_pair { {INTERPOSER
../data/Interposer_all.ploc} \\                       {DIE0
../data/Die0_all.ploc} \\                       {DIE1
../data/Die1_all.ploc} \\                       {DIE2
../data/Die2_all.ploc} \\                       {DIE3
../data/Die3_all.ploc} }   "*" 2 The following command performs the sanity check for the generated mapping file:  map_dies \\  -mode sanity_check \\  -output Results \\  -3dic_design_stack_file
./data/design_stack.xml \\  -3dic_config_file
./data/design_stack.xml \\  -component_config_file
./data/Components.config \\  -stacked_die_mapping
./data/die2die_bump.map \\  -map_search_distance 5 \\
