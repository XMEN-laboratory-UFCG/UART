.SH Name \fBwrite_name_mapping\fR \-  Writes or updates the initial netlist key point names and corresponding current netlist key point names to a file
.SH Syntax \fBwrite_name_mapping\fR   [-help]    [-bbox_pins]  [-hierarchical]  [-map_pins {input output all}]   [-pin_polarity]   [-enable_one_to_one_mapping | -report_power_format]  [-skip_clock_gate]  [-updated_only]   {<output_filename> | [[-output <output_directory>] -prefix <filename_prefix>]}   [-hdl | -initial | [-input_mapping_file <mapping_file>[-print_deleted]]] 
.P Writes or updates the initial netlist key point names and corresponding current netlist key point names to a file. Mapping file consists of pin mapping information of all changes done during the flow (between comparison points) including polarity changes
. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each write_name_mapping parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man write_name_mapping  "\fB-bbox_pins\fR" Prints the pins of bbox in the output mapping file instead of inst names. 
.RS  "*" 2 Prints bbox input pins if -map_pins {input} is specified.  "*" 2 Prints bbox output pins if -map_pins {output} is specified.  "*" 2 Prints both input and output pins if -map_pins {all} is specified. 
.RE   "\fB-enable_one_to_one_mapping\fR" When set to true, only one of the clones will be printed in the mapping file.   "\fB<output_filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the output mapping file.   "\fB-hdl\fR" Enables the generation of name mapping from current names to the names defined by the 'hdl_name' attribute. This will be used for power analysis.  "\fB-hierarchical\fR" Specify if write out other post boundary optimizations mapping   "\fB-initial \fR" Enables the generation of name mapping from current names to names defined by the 'initial_name' attribute.  This will be used for verification of initial input netlist (post-synthesis) to any other netlist generated during the Innovus flow. The write_do_lec command in Innovus will call write_name_mapping -initial so that Conformal LEC do file and name mapping file are generated in one shot. The do file will source the name mapping file to facilitate key point mapping in LEC.  "\fB-input_mapping_file <mapping_file>\fR" When provided, the Tool will read existing mapping file and write out updated mapping file.   "\fB-map_pins {input output all}\fR" Specify type of pins to write out.  Default: input  "\fB-output <output_directory>\fR" Specify output directory   "\fB-pin_polarity\fR" Specify if write out polarity information   "\fB-prefix <filename_prefix>\fR" Used for file name prefix   "\fB-print_deleted\fR" When -print_deleted is specified the mapping file will also print deleted instances.   "\fB-report_power_format\fR" Specify if write out 1Pass power replay format.   "\fB-skip_clock_gate\fR" Filters out ICGs that are not in RTL.  If you set -skip_clock_gate to true with -hdl, the tool skips the clock gate pins except the pins with hdl_name. If -skip_clock_gate is set to true and -hdl is not specified, the tool skips all clock gate pins.  "\fB-updated_only\fR" Skips printing the pin that does not have any change/update during optimizations/flow.
