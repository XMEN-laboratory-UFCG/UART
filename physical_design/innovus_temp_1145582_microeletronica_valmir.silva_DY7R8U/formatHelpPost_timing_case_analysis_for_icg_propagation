.SH Name \fBtiming_case_analysis_for_icg_propagation\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_case_analysis_for_icg_propagation\fR  {false | require_seq_prop | always} 
.P Default: false
.P Determines the conditions in which the constants are propagated through the integrated clock gating (ICG) cells. 
.P The available options are described below:   "\fBOption\fR" Description  "\fBalways\fR" Enables constant propagation through ICGs, regardless of the value of the timing_case_analysis_for_sequential_propagation global variable, or the value of setAnalysisMode -sequentialConstProp setting. This allows the software to have constant propagation for ICG cells, even when this is disabled for other sequential devices.  "\fBfalse\fR" Disables constant propagation through ICG cells.  "\fBrequire_seq_prop\fR" When the require_seq_prop option is used, the software will treat ICG cells like other cells in the design from the perspective of constant propagation. This means that the timing_case_analysis_for_sequential_propagation global variable or setAnalysisMode -sequentialConstProp setting will act as a master switch and will control constant propagation through ICGs also.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
