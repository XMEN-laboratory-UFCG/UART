.TH update_oa_lib  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBupdate_oa_lib\fR \-  Updates the specified OpenAccess library from within Innovus
.SH Syntax \fBupdate_oa_lib\fR   [-help]   <lib_name>   [-compress_level <value>]  [-create_cdsinfo_tag]   [-tech_attach_to_reference]
.P Updates the specified OpenAccess library from within Innovus. You can use this command to:
.RS  "*" 2  Convert the specified library to use a tech reference from the attached tech so that the non-parameterized or custom vias can be written to it. Saving non-parameterized vias to OA require write permission to OA tech so that custom viadef entry can be created. If attached technology is read-only and OpenAccess design has non-parameterized vias, you should run update_oa_lib with -tech_attach_to_reference command line option before invoking saveDesign. The tool is then able to save the design and does not throw an error because it can now make non-parameterized vias entry to local tech in the converted library.  "*" 2  Add a cdsinifo.tag to legacy libraries created by earlier versions of Innovus.  "*" 2  Modify the compression level for the library.
.RE
.P If you run the update_oa_lib command on a library that is not in attached mode, a warning is displayed. However, the script continues to run. This is useful if you want to make sure that libraries are writable for new vias and the saveDesign command does not fail. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each update_oa_lib parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man update_oa_lib.  "\fB-compress_level <value>\fR" Sets the compression level of the specified library. New cellviews written to the library follow the specified compression level. However, existing cellviews in the library are not modified. Use the oazip utility to modify the existing cellviews in the library.  Valid compression level values range from 0 to 9. A value of 0 indicates that compression is turned off.  "\fB-create_cdsinfo_tag\fR" Adds a cdsinfo.tag file to the specified library.   "\fB<lib_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the library to be updated.  "\fB-tech_attach_to_reference\fR" Converts the specified library to use a tech reference from the attached tech so that new custom via definitions can be added to the library. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the compression level of the lib1 library to 9. However, it does not change the compression of the existing cellviews in the library:  update_oa_lib lib1 -compress_level 9  The tool displays warning such as the following:  Changed library compressLevel from '0 (uncompressed)' to '9'. Cellviews within the library are not affected by changing the library's compressLevel. To update the cellviews, use the oazip utility.  "*" 2 The following command turns off the compression for any newly created cellviews in my_lib library, which previously is at compression level 1:  update_oa_lib my_lib -compress_level 0
