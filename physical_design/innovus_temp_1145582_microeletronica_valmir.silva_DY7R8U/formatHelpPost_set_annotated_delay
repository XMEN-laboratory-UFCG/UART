.SH Name \fBset_annotated_delay\fR \-  Annotates delay to timing arcs
.SH Syntax \fBset_annotated_delay\fR  [-help]  <delay_value>  [-cond <expression>]  [-delta_only]  [-fall]   [-increment]  [-max]  [-min]  [-rise]  {-net | -cell }  {[-from <from_pins>] [-to <to_pins>]}  
.P Annotates delay to timing arcs. If you specify the set_annotated_delay command without any parameters, the delay value specified is assumed to include both the base delay and any delta (cross-talk) delay. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-cond <expression>\fR" Specifies the sdf condition of the selected timing arcs.   Default: The delay applies to all the timing arcs selected using the -from and the -to options. The expression is ignored for net arcs.  Note: You cannot specify the -cond parameter with -net. If specified, an error is displayed.  "\fB<delay_value>\fR" Specifies the delay value to be annotated to the selected timing arcs.  "\fB-delta_only\fR" Populates the incremental delay slot with the delay value, so that you can differentiate between the base net delay and a delay offset that is due to cross talk. The software reports the incremental (or delta) delay value separately in the timing report using report_timing -format incr_delay, and maintains the separate value for CPPR calculations.  If the base delay was previously calculated or annotated from the SDF, the -delta_only parameter adds the specified delay to the existing base delay.  Note: This parameter only can be used with the -net parameter; you cannot specify it with the -cell parameter.  "\fB-from <from_pins>\fR" Specifies timing arcs to which the delay applies. The selected timing arcs are those that have their source pins specified using this option and the sink pins specified using the -to option. If this option is not specified, only timing arcs whose sink pins are specified using the -to option are selected.  Note: You cannot specify hierarchical pins. If specified, an error message is displayed.  "\fB-increment\fR" Increments the specified delay value on top of the existing base delay value.  "\fB-min | -max\fR" Specifies the annotated delay for a particular operating corner. You can apply the -min parameter to the minimum operating corner and the -max parameter to the maximum operating corner.  "\fB-net | -cell\fR" Specifies whether the delay should be annotated to cell arcs or net arcs.  "\fB-rise/-fall\fR" Specifies the transition to which the delay applies. For cell arc, this is the output transition.  Default: The delay applies to both transitions.  "\fB-to <to_pins>\fR" Specifies timing arcs to which the delay applies. The selected timing arcs are those that have their sink pins specified using this option and the source pins specified using the -from option. If this option is not specified, only timing arcs whose source pins are specified using the -from option are selected.  Note: You cannot specify hierarchical pins. If specified, an error message is displayed.
