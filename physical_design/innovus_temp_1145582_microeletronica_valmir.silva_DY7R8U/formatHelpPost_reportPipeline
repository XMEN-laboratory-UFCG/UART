.SH Name \fBreportPipeline\fR \-  The command can be used for analysis before the flops exist in the netlist; or it can be used post flop insertion to either report expected average wire-length between stages of a pipeline net group, or to report the achieved average distance between the placed stages of the pipeline
.SH Syntax \fBreportPipeline\fR   [-help]   [-netGroup <netGroupNames>]   [{-spacing <value> | -timingBased  | -psPMBased } -file <fileName>]
.P The command can be used for analysis before the flops exist in the netlist; or it can be used post flop insertion to either report expected average wire-length between stages of a pipeline net group, or to report the achieved average distance between the placed stages of the pipeline. When used for analysis, the command reports expected number of PFF stages for each net group based on the user-specified value. Optionally the command generates bus-guides for reported route-path. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Specified the output for additional information from the command. The output includes expected placement location of PFF at each stage in analysis flow.  "\fB-netGroup <netGroupNames>\fR" Restricts the report to the net group name specified. If no net group name is specified, all pipeline net groups are reported.  "\fB-spacing<value>| -timingBased | -psPMBased\fR" Given the target approximate wire-length spacing between stages, -spacing suggests the number of flop stages to insert.  -timingBased is used to automatically estimate the number of pipeline FFs needed, based on timing delay on routing layers and the clock cycle requirement. It is mutually exclusive to option -spacing because the spacing can be decided automatically.  -psPMBased is used to automatically find maximum spacing using pspm model. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reports expected number of PFF stages for net group "netGroup1" if the distance between each stage is around 300 microns:   reportPipeline -netGroup netGroup1 -spacing 300 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reports the expected number of PFF stages for net group netGroup1 if the distance between each stage is around 300 microns. Additional information of expected placement location of each stage are written in the file PFF.rpt:   reportPipeline -netGroup netGroup1 -spacing 300 -file PFF.rpt
