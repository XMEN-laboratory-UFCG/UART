.TH generate_vertical_cell_edge_constraint  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBgenerate_vertical_cell_edge_constraint\fR \-  Generates the bottom and top cell edge constraints for 10nm libraries to avoid vertical cell abutment that may cause pin access issue on M1 and M2. The vertical M2 fat PIN or OBS has impact on the abutted cell when it is near to the top and bottom boundaries
.SH Syntax \fBgenerate_vertical_cell_edge_constraint\fR   [-help]   {-file <tclFile> | -updateDB }   [[-check_m2_only ] | [-check_m2_to_m1_only ]] 
.P Generates the bottom and top cell edge constraints for 10nm libraries to avoid vertical cell abutment that may cause pin access issue on M1 and M2. The vertical M2 fat PIN or OBS has impact on the abutted cell when it is near to the top and bottom boundaries. It can cause DRC violations between M2 PIN/OBS, block some of the M1 pin access points in the abutted cell, and make router hard to access those M1 PINs. 
.P The following graphic show an example of how fat M2 Pin/OBS may block 3 or 6 access points.

.P The generate_vertical_cell_edge_constraint command generates vertical cell edge constraints based on the cell libraries and LEF rules. Placer is aware of these constraints and avoids the bad placement patterns. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-check_m2_only\fR" Checks M2 to M2 pins only in abutted 2 cells when generating cell edge constraints.   "\fB-check_m2_to_m1_only\fR" Checks M2 to M1 pins only in abutted 2 cells when generating cell edge constraints.    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each generate_vertical_cell_edge_constraint parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man generate_vertical_cell_edge_constraint.  "\fB-file <tclFile>\fR" Specifies file name to output vertical tcl constraint.   "\fB-updateDB\fR" Updates the constraints to DB.
.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 You must specify -file or -updateDB.  "*" 2 The -file option is for the debug mode, and you need to source the tcl file to let placer know about the constraints.  "*" 2 The -updated option is for the standard flow usage. It reads the constraints automatically.
