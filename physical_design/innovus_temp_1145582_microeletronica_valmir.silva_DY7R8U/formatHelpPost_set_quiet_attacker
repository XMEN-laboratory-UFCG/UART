.TH set_quiet_attacker  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_quiet_attacker\fR \-  Specifies one or more coupled nets as non-attackers (silent) for the delay and glitch analysis of a given victim net
.SH Syntax \fBset_quiet_attacker\fR   [-help]  [-analysis_type {early | late}]  [-attacker <string>]   [-transition {rise | fall}]  [-victim <string>]  [-view <string>]
.P Specifies one or more coupled nets as non-attackers (silent) for the delay and glitch analysis of a given victim net.
.P You can run the update_glitch or update_timing command and view the results in the report_noise or report_timing command output. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-analysis_type {early | late}\fR" Specifies the analysis type for which the attackers will be assumed quiet. If no value is specified, attackers are skipped for both early/late analysis.    "\fB-attacker <string>\fR" Specifies the attackers which should be made quiet for given victim net(s). If no attacker is specified, all the aggressors of given victim(s) will be ignored.  Note: If no victim is specified, the specified attackers are made quiet for all victim nets in the design.   "\fB-transition {rise | fall}\fR" Specifies the victim transition for which attackers will be assumed quiet. If no value is specified, attackers are skipped for both rise and  fall transitions of the victim net.    "\fB-victim <string>\fR" Specifies a list of victim nets for which attackers should be made quiet. Specific attackers can be skipped using the -attacker option of this command. If the -attacker option is not specified, all the attackers of the given nets are made silent and SI analysis will not be performed on these nets.  Note: If this option is not specified, the attackers specified in the -attacker option are made quiet for all the nets in the design.    "\fB-view <string>\fR" Specifies the view for which attackers should be made quiet. If no view is specified, attackers are assumed quiet in all views 
.SH Examples
.P Consider a design having an attacker agg to victim nets vic1 and vic2. The following command sets the attacker agg as quiet for both the victim nets vic1 and vic2.  set_quiet_attacker -attacker {agg}
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the attackers A1 and A2 as quiet when V1 is rising during late analysis.   set_quiet_attacker -victim V1 -attacker A1 A2 -transition rise -analysis_type late
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the attacker A1 quiet for victim V1 in the analysis view VIEW1. In this case, A1 may be a valid attacker during SI analysis for victim V1 in views other than VIEW1.   set_quiet_attacker -victim V1 -attacker A1 -view {VIEW1}
.RE
.P Consider a design having victim vic with attackers agg1 and agg2:
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets both the attackers agg1 and agg2 as quiet for the victim net vic.  set_quiet_attacker -victim {vic}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the attacker agg1 as quiet for the given victim net vic  set_quiet_attacker -attacker {agg1} -victim {vic}
