.SH Name \fBsetActiveLogicViewMode\fR \-  Controls certain behaviors of active logic view commands
.SH Syntax \fBsetActiveLogicViewMode\fR  [-help]  [-reset]  [-keepAsync {false | true}]  [-keepHighFanoutPorts {true| false}]  [-keepInstInSdc {true|false}]  [-keepLoopBack {false | true}] 
.P Controls certain behaviors of active logic view commands.
.P Use the setActiveLogicViewMode command to display the current settings for the createActiveLogicView command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-keepAsync {false | true}\fR" Discards or retains the portion of the netlist relating to asynchronous control and scan controls terminals. By default, the tool discards this portion of the netlist. This option potentially conflicts the setting of setAnalysisMode -asyncChecks async when the analysis for an asynchronous circuit is desired. When this happens, a warning message is issued.  Default: false  "\fB-keepHighFanoutPorts {true | false}\fR" Retains or discards the portion of the netlist relating to high-fanout ports. By default, the tool retains this portion of the netlist.  Default: true  "\fB-keepInstInSdc {true|false}\fR" Keeps instances which have constraints on it.  Default: false  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setActiveLogicViewMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setActiveLogicViewMode  "\fB-keepLoopBack {false | true}\fR" Discards or retains the portion of the netlist relating to input and output loopback paths. By default, the tool discards this portion of the netlist.  Default: false  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets the active logic view mode command parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported. 
.SH Example
.P The following command resets all the setActiveLogicViewMode parameters to their default values:
