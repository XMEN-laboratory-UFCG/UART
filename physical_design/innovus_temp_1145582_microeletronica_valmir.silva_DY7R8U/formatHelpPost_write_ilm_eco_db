.RS  "*" 2 Generates a binary ECO file that can be read/loaded back to a block-level design  "*" 2 Generates the ECO TCL script with read_ilm_eco_db -module_model_tag for iHDB  "*" 2 Output as corresponding ECO report file for viewing purpose

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description of the write_ilm_eco_db command. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man write_ilm_eco_db  "\fB-cell <tcl_obj>\fR" Specifies a cell name for ECO information to be written out. If the specified cell name does not have any ECO change, both ECO and report files will be empty. If this option is not specified, the command will write ECO information for all ILMs specified in the design EVEN an ILM cell is not allowed for ECO. This to make sure accumulated ECO information will be preserved/saved as an ILM can be opened and then closed later during the flow. If there is no ECO change done to a particular cell, its ECO and report files will be empty.  "\fB-dir <directoryName>\fR" Specifies a directory name where ECO files will be saved. All the ECO and/or report files should be saved under the convention <dirName>/<cellName>/<cellName.eco> and <dirName>/<cellName>/<cellName.rpt>, respectively.  "\fB-module_model_tag <tagName>\fR" Specifies the model tag name where ECO file, ECO TCL, and its report will be saved. This option should be used for Stylus hierarchical DB.
