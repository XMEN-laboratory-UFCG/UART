.TH spaceBondPad  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBspaceBondPad\fR \-  Spaces bond pads and the corresponding area I/O instances based on the constraints returned by the getCellDist()Tcl script
.SH Syntax \fBspaceBondPad\fR  [-help]   [-spread] 
.P Spaces bond pads and the corresponding area I/O instances based on the constraints returned by the getCellDist()Tcl script.
.P The command distributes excess space until all the bond pads reach their maximum spacing constraint returned by the getCellDist () Tcl script or until the time when no extra space is left between the instances.
.P The initial distribution of space occurs for the clusters of instances that have the first or the last bond pads in the row. The remaining iterations equally distribute the remaining space between each I/O. The I/O instances that are in the end are placed at minimum spacing to the die edges, both on the left and right sides of the die.
.P The I/O pads will snap to I/O sites and the corresponding bond pads (bumps) will shift accordingly.
.P You can define the constraints in the getCellDist() Tcl script as follows:
.P proc getCellDist { <xp> <yp> <xn> <yn> <padPosition> <padCount> <side> <ioRow> <staggerPos> <ioName> }
.P Here:
.RS  "*" 2 <xp> <yp> - Specifies the x and y coordinates of a previous bond pad having the same stagger position. If first, the location is 0, 0.  "*" 2 <xn> <yn> - Specifies the x and y coordinates of the previous neighboring bond pad having any stagger position. If first, the location is 0, 0.   "*" 2 <padPosition> - Specifies the position of the bond pad. The position can be i (inner), m (middle), or o (outer).   "*" 2 padCount - Specifies the current bond pad count for bond pads at the same stagger position. For example, 1 for the first inner bond pad, 2 for the second inner bond pad, and so on.   "*" 2 <side> - Specifies the n (North), s (South), e (East), or w (West) side of the bond pad.   "*" 2 <ioRow> - Specifies the I/O row.   "*" 2 <staggerPos> - Specifies the stagger type.   "*" 2 ioName - Specifies the name of the I/O. 
.RE
.P Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 The bond pad spacing for North and South is done from left to right.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The bond pad spacing for East and West is done from bottom to top.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The bond pad spacing for each side and ring is done independently.

.P After using the spaceBondPad command, you can use the checkBondPadSpacing command to check the bond pad spacing. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each spaceBondPad parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man spaceBondPad  "\fB-spread\fR" Removes any extra spacing that may exist between   I/O cells, which were placed based on the rules defined in the getCellDist()Tcl script, and evenly distirbutes the extra space between all of the I/O cells in that row. You can use this parameter if there are large gaps (spaces) between I/O cells.
