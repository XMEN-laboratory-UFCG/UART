.SH Name \fBcreateAbuttedFPlan\fR
.SH Syntax \fBcreateAbuttedFPlan\fR   [-help]   [-cutToFixOverlap]   [-honorPlaceBlockage <blockageName>]   [-ptnToCoreGap <distance>]   [-ptnToPtnGap <distance>]   {-hinsts <hierarchicalInstanceList> | -selected | -all}
.P Creates an abutted floorplan from an existing floorplan by fixing gaps between:
.RS  "*" 2 Partitions  "*" 2 Partition and core boundary  "*" 2 Partition and macro when there is no overlap between the partition and the macro
.RE
.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 The createAbuttedFPlan command honors place blockage when the blockage has no overlap with the partition. It does not honor doughnut and master/clone partitions.  "*" 2 When you use the createAbuttedFPlan command, partitions grow. The order in which partitions grow is top edge,bottom edge,left edge,right edge. Also, some partitions shrink when the -ptnToPtnGap option is used. The order in which partitions shrink is left edge, top edge, right edge, bottom edge.   "*" 2 When there is an overlap between two partitions, if the width of the overlapped shape is less than the height, the partition with the lower TU shrinks horizontally.  However, if the width of overlapped shape is bigger than the height, the partition with the lower TU shrinks vertically.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createAbuttedFPlan parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man createAbuttedFPlan  "\fB-all\fR" Specifies to grow all partitions in the design.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-cutToFixOverlap\fR" Cuts the overlapped partitions, if specified. Otherwise, the tool will shrink the partitions instead of cutting.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-hinsts h<ierarchicalInstanceList>\fR" Specifies a list of hierarchical instances that will be modified.  Default: All partitions in the design.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-honorPlaceBlockage b<lockageName>\fR" Specifies to fill gap upto the placement blockage boundary only. If a blockage name is specified, it honors only the specified blockage name.  Default: Does not honor placement blockage.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-ptnToCoreGap d<istance>\fR" Specifies the required distance (in micron) between a partition boundary and and a core boundary after growing the partition.  Default: 0 micron  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-ptnToPtnGap d<istance>\fR" Specifies the required distance (in micron) between the partitions after growing the partitions.  Default: 0 micron  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-selected\fR" Specifies to grow selected partitions.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command grows the selected partition  createAbuttedFPlan -selected  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 If a partition overlaps another partition, the partition with higher target utilization keeps the original shape. The other partition shrinks to remove the overlap.   The following command keeps the originals shape of proc0/rf0 and shrinks the other partitions to remove the overlap.  createAbuttedFPlan -all  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command cuts the proc0/iu0 partition and keeps the original shape of the proc0/rf0 partition, which has higher utilization, to remove the overlap.  createAbuttedFPlan -cutToFixOverlap -all  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command honors the place blockage which is not overlapping the partition by default.  createAbuttedFPlan -all -honorPlaceBlockage all   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 The following command keeps the gap between two partitions, and between partitions and the core boundary after growing partition.  createAbuttedFPlan -ptnToCoreGap 5 -ptnToPtnGap 5 -all -cutToFixOverlap  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
