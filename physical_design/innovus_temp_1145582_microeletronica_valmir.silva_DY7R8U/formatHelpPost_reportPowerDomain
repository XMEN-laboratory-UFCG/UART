.SH Name \fBreportPowerDomain\fR \-  Reports information about power domains
.SH Syntax \fBreportPowerDomain\fR  [-help]  [-bindLib]  [-file <outFile>]  [-inst <inst_name>]  [-isoInst]  [-module {list_of_modules}]  [-net <net_name>]  [-partitionHports <pin> | <port> | <hpin>+]  [-pgNet]  [-pin]  [-powerDomain <powerDomainName>[-checkPgScope]]  [-powerDomainBoundaryPort <string>]  [-powerDomainCoverage <pd1 pd2>]  [-shifter]  [-supplyCrossing <supp1 supp2>]  [-verbose]  [-voltage] 
.P Reports information about power domains. The report includes the following attributes:
.RS  "*" 2 Power domain name  "*" 2 Power domain bounding box  "*" 2 Timing library  "*" 2 Mingap  "*" 2 RS extension  "*" 2 Row type  "*" 2 Row spacing
.RE
.P The command also reports whether the power domain is always on. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each reportPowerDomain parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man reportPowerDomain.  "\fB-bindLib\fR" Reports the timing library bound to each instance of a power domain.  "\fB-checkPgScope\fR" Checks if there are any PG connections that cross UPF-defined scope. All PG connections for UPF scope should be at the boundary PG port. This parameter is used with the -powerDomain parameter.  "\fB-file <outFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file.  Default: <designName>-powerdomain.rpt  "\fB-inst <inst_name>\fR" Reports the power domain-related information for the specified instance: the input, output, and power/ground connections.  When -inst is used along with the -verbose parameter, as reportPowerDomain -inst -verbose, the instance PG and tie-high/low pin connections along their its global connection rule are reported.  "\fB-isoInst\fR" Reports all isolation cells in the power domain.  "\fB-module {list of modules}\fR" Checks whether the specified instances or hierarchical instances are in the power domain.  Default: The software does not perform this check.  "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Reports power domain-related information for the specified net:
.RS  "*" 2 The driver instance of the net and its power domain.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The receiver instances of the net and their power domains.
.RE   "\fB-partitionHports <pin> | <port> | <hpin>+\fR" Reports the hierarchical partition (Hinst) boundary port's domain at the time of partitioning.   "\fB-pin <pin1, pin2
...>\fR" Specifies the lists the pins and the option is of type string. This option is optional.   "\fB-powerDomain <powerDomainName>\fR" Specifies the power domain whose attributes you want to report.  Default: If you do not specify the power domain, this command report data about all power domains.  "\fB-powerDomainBoundaryPort <string>\fR" Reports if the specified port name of the power domain boundary has an IEEE1801 constraint.  "\fB-powerDomainCoverage <pd1 pd2>\fR" Reports the coverage between two specified domains.  "\fB-pgNet\fR" Reports all the power/ground nets in the power domain.  "\fB-shifter\fR" Reports all shifters in the power domain.  "\fB-supplyCrossing <supp1 supp2>\fR" Reports if the two specified supplies have the on/off and low/high crossing.  "\fB-verbose\fR" Prints out the detail information and is optional.   "\fB-voltage\fR" Reports domain voltage. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks the I1/PD1 instances to identify if there are any PG connections that do not use the UPF I1 PG nets. If those are found, an error occurs specifying the instance name and its out-of-scope PG connection.  reportPowerDomain -checkPgScope true -powerDomain I1/PD1  "*" 2 The following command reports all shifter cells, all isolation cells, and all power/ground nets in power domain PD1. The command also checks whether HInst instA is contained in PD1, and reports all results to myDesign-powerdomain.rpt.   reportPowerDomain -powerDomain PD1 -file myDesign-powerdomain.rpt -module {instA} -shifter -isoInst -pgNet
