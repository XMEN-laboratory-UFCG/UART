.TH timing_recompute_sdf_in_setuphold_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_recompute_sdf_in_setuphold_mode\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_recompute_sdf_in_setuphold_mode\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Controls the recomputing of SDF delays when the software is in simultaneous setup and hold analysis mode.
.P When the software is not in simultaneous setup and hold analysis mode, only one corner of data is stored at a time; therefore additional delay calculation is required for write_sdf. When the software is in simultaneous setup and hold analysis mode, both sets of data are in memory at the same time, and additional delay calculation is not necessary.
.P If set to false, write_sdf will write out the delays from memory, instead of calling delay calculation.
.P Note: This global variable must be used with timing_enable_simultaneous_setup_hold_mode true.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
