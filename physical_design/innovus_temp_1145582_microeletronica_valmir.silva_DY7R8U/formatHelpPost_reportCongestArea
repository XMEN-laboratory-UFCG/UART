.SH Name \fBreportCongestArea\fR \-  Reports the congestion hot spots in the design
.SH Syntax \fBreportCongestArea\fR  [-help]  [-num [all | <numOfHotSpot>]]   [-cutOffRatio <cutOffRatioOfPeakHotSpot>]  [-cutOffValue <cutOffCongestNum>]  [-mode <modeName>]  [-step <num>]  [-cutoffArea <cutOffGcellNum>]  [-outfile <fileName>] 
.P Reports the congestion hot spots in the design.
.P The Innovus software uses the following algorithm to define the boundaries of hot spots:
.RS  "*" 2 Finds the most over-congested gcell (that is, the gcell with the largest overflow value) in the design. A gcell has overflow if its demand exceeds its supply. Typically, the supply is the number of unobstructed tracks crossing the gcell, and the demand is the number of wires assigned to it.   "*" 2 Starting from the over-congested gcell, checks a specified number of gcells (using -step) in one direction  for  congestion. If the gcells  have an overflow value that is less than the specified congestion threshold (using -cutOffRatio or -cutOffValue), the software determines this to be the boundary for that side of the hot  spot, and begins checking in a new direction.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 After the software establishes the boundaries for the first hot spot, it finds the next most over-congested gcell that is not part of the already defined hot spot and begins defining the boundaries for it. You can use the reportCongestArea command after running Early Global Route.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-cutoffArea <cutOffGcellNum>\fR" Filters out any hot spots that have an area (specified in gcells) that is less than <cutOffGcellNum.>   Default: 0 (Reports all hot spots in the design)  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-cutOffRatio  <cutOffRatioOfPeakHotSpot>\fR" Specifies the minimum congestion threshold value a gcell must have to be considered part of the hot spot, as a ratio of the peak overflow value.  The software checks the congestion for the gcell by dividing the overflow value of the most over-congested gcell (that is, the peak overflow value) by the overflow value of the gcell. If the resulting congestion value is less than the specified <cutOffRatioOfPeakHotSpot>, the software determines this to be the boundary for that side of the hot spot, and begins checking in a new direction.  Min: 0  Max: 1  Default: 0.01  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-cutOffValue <cutOffCongestNum>  \fR" Specifies the minimum overflow value a gcell must have to be considered part of the hot spot.  Default: -2  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-mode <modeName>  \fR" Specifies the mode, average or max, on which congestion hot spots in the design are reported.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each reportCongestArea parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command   man reportCongestArea.  "\fB-num [all |<numOfHotSpot>]\fR" Specifies how many hot spots to report.  Default: 10
.RS  "*" 2 all: Reports all hot spots in the design.  "*" 2 <numOfHotSpot>: Reports up to the specified number of hot spots in the design.
.RE   Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-outfile<fileName>  \fR" Outputs the hot spot report to the specified file.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-step<num>\fR" Specifies the number of gcells to check for congestion.  Default: 3  Data_type: string, optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command outputs a report describing up to10 hot spots in the design that are found by checking three gcells at a time, using an absolute congestion threshold of -2 and a relative threshold value of 0.01:   reportCongestArea -step 3 -cutoffRatio 0.010000 -cutoffValue -2 -num 10 -mode average   The resulting report contains the following hot spot information for vertical and horizontal congestion:
.RS  "*" 2 The largest overflow value for the hot spot (#Peak)  "*" 2 The location of the gcell that contains the largest overflow value (Location)  "*" 2 The boundary coordinates for the hot spot (Boundary Box)  "*" 2 The area of the hot spot, in gcells (Area)  "*" 2 The following example shows the congestion hot spot report generated by the previous command:   # Vertical Congestion Area Report  #Peak   Location(X,Y)      Boundary Box                 Area(#Gcell)   -36      (1791.7,  376.4)    (1778,  332) (1792,  786)    (6x123)  -23      ( 607.2,  284.1)    ( 580,  251) ( 607,  306)    (12x15)   -20      (1791.7, 2236.1)    (1778, 2214) (1792, 2247)    (6x9)   -18      ( 607.2,  125.5)    ( 593,   92) ( 607,  148)    (6x15)   -15      ( 637.1,  380.1)    ( 630,  347) ( 720,  435)    (39x24)   -14      (1791.7,  859.8)    (1778,  860) (1792,  982)    (6x33)   # Horizontal Congestion Area Report   #Peak   Location(X,Y)      Boundary Box                 Area(#Gcell)  -92      (1777.9, 114.4)    (1750, 4) (1854, 114)         (45x30)   -60      ( 623.3, 114.4)    ( 472, 4) ( 816, 125)         (150x33)

.RS  "*" 2 The following line from the example shows that the largest overflow value for one hot spot is -36, the gcell that contains the overflow value is located at 1791.7 376.4, the coordinates for the hot spot boundary are (1778, 332) (1792, 786), and the hot spot is 6 gcells by 123 gcells in size:   -36      (1791.7,  376.4)    (1778,  332) (1792,  786)    (6x123)
