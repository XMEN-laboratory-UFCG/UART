.SH Name \fBspecifyNetWeight\fR \-  Specifies the priority weighting of a net. You can use this command after importing the design
.SH Syntax \fBspecifyNetWeight\fR   [-help]  netName
... netWeightValue
.P Specifies the priority weighting of a net. You can use this command after importing the design.
.P Note: Partition pin assignment honors specifyNetWeight. Pins that connect to a net that has a higher net weight are assigned before the pins that connect to a net with a lower net weight.
.P Note: The setPlaceMode -place_global_clock_gate_aware option has higher priority over specifyNetWeight and hence, if it is set then tool will not honor the weights on the clock net during the placement run as specified using the specifyNetWeight command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each   specifyNetWeight parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all   of its parameters, use the man command:   man specifyNetWeight  "\fB<netName..>\fR" Specifies the name(s) of an individual net. You can use wildcards (*?) with this parameter.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB<netWeightValue>\fR" Specifies the weighting priority of the net name, with values 512 (highest) through 1 (lowest), or 0 (don't care).  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the weight for nets is 2.  The placer will try to shorten nets with higher weight, and give less priority to lower weights (ignoring nets with weight 0). The placer has a limit of 10 for the highest weight, and will treat any value above 10 as 10. The router will route higher weighted nets before lower weighted nets.  Data_type: string, required 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands set the priority net weighting for nets STRW to first, WE2N to second, and IOWIN to third:  specifyNetWeight WE2N 9  specifyNetWeight STRW 10  specifyNetWeight IOWIN 8  "*" 2 specifyNetWeight does not accept a Tcl list. You can list multiple nets by omitting the curly brackets:  specifyNetWeight n1 n2 10  specifyNetWeight n5 scan* 1  You can also surround it with a foreach loop:  foreach net [dbGet top.nets.name n*] {specifyNetWeight $net 10}
