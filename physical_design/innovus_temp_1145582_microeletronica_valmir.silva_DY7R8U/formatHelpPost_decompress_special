.SH Name \fBdecompress_special\fR \-  Decompresses Power-Grid (PG) objects within the specified area, layer, or net
.SH Syntax \fBdecompress_special\fR  [-help]  [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]  [-layers <layer>+]  [-nets <net>+]
.P Decompresses Power-Grid (PG) objects within the specified area, layer, or net. This command decompresses only the overlapped part in case of partial overlapping. The rest of the part is regrouped. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each decompress_special parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man decompress_special  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates for the area from which PG needs to be decompressed. The decompress_special command decompresses only those special wires and special vias, which exist within the area specified by this parameter.  Default: All PG structures are decompressed.  "\fB-layers <layer>+\fR" Specifies the layers on which PG decompression is needed. This parameter requires either LEF layer names or a routing layer index value (for example, 1 for the first routing layer,  2 for the second routing layer, and so on).   "\fB-nets <net>+\fR" Specifies the nets from which PG decompression is needed. 
.SH Example
.P The following command decompresses %s special_wires and %s special_vias:
.P decompress_special -area {100 100 120 120} -layer Via56
