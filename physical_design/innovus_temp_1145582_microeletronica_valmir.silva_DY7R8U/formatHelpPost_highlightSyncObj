.SH Name \fBhighlightSyncObj\fR \-  Adds highlight color on sync objects during master-clone-aware bus guide operations
.SH Syntax \fBhighlightSyncObj\fR  [-help]   [-obj {all busGuides}] 
.P Adds highlight color on sync objects during master-clone-aware bus guide operations. The colors used for highlighting are based on different color schema categories - user-drawn, bounded, or unbounded. These categories are derived from the last sync command (clonePtnObj -sync or setFPlanMode -autoSyncMasterClone busGuides) used. This command makes it easy to distinguish between different bus guide objects in the design.
.RS  "*" 2 User-drawn bus guides are highlighted in yellow.  "*" 2 Bounded bus guides are highlighted in red. Nets in bounded bus guides can be determined during sync operation. If either (or both) the source or driver partition is a master-clone, the tool can determine the equivalent net during sync (in master clone chains).   For example: Consider A1-B1-C1 and A2-B2-C2 chains where A/B/C1 A/B/C2 are master clones. A1/2 pin k is connected to net n1 (in A1) and n2 (in A2). As we can easily determine n1 and n2 in the chains, this is a case of bounded bus guides.  "*" 2 Unbounded bus guides are highlighted in blue. Nets in unbounded bus guides cannot be determined during sync operation. If both source or driver partition are unique or (special case master and clone but their equivalent pin is floating), the tool cannot determine the net during sync (in master and clone chains).   For example: Consider UA1-B1-UC1 and UA2-B2-UC2 chains where B1 and B2 are master clones. UA1/UC1/UA2/UC2 are all unique but UA1/UA2 pin may be different. Here since we cannot determine equivalent nets of chains, this is a case of unbounded bus guides.

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each highlightSyncObj parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man highlightSyncObj  "\fB-obj {all busGuides}\fR" Specifies the object to be highlighted.  Data_type: enum_list, optional
