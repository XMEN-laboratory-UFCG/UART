.SH Name \fBset_drive\fR \-  Sets the drive resistance on the specified input and/or bidirectional ports of the top cell
.SH Syntax  \fBset_drive\fR  [-rise] [-fall]   [-max] [-min]   <resistance_value>  <port_list> 
.P Sets the drive resistance on the specified input and/or bidirectional ports of the top cell.
.P The drive resistance models the cell driving the port. This resistance is used to compute the load dependent delay and the slew at the specified ports. The load-dependent delay is added to the arrival times.
.P The load-dependent delay and the slew are computed by multiplying the drive resistance by the wire capacitance of the net connected to the port.
.P Use the report_ports command to view drive resistances asserted on ports. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-fall\fR" Specifies that the drive resistance is to be used for the falling transition at the specified ports. By default, if neither the -rise nor the -fall option are specified, the drive resistance applies to both the rising transition and the falling transition.  "\fB-min\fR" Specifies that the drive resistance is to be used to compute the early path delay. By default, if neither the -min option nor the -max option is specified, the drive resistance applies to both the early path delay and the late path delay.  "\fB-max\fR" Specifies that the drive resistance is to be used to compute the late path delay. By default, if neither the -min option nor the -max option is specified, the drive resistance applies to both the early path delay and the late path delay.  "\fB<port_list>\fR" Specifies a list of input or bidirectional ports on which the drive resistance is set.  "\fB<resistance_value>\fR" Specifies the value of the drive resistance. This value must be greater than or equal to zero. The drive resistance is in units found in the target technology library.  "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies that the drive resistance is to be used for the rising transitions at the specified ports. By default, if neither the -rise option nor the -fall option are specified, the drive resistance applies to both the rising transition and the falling transition. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets a drive resistance of 2.0 for the early path, the late path, the rising and the falling transitions at the in1 and in2 ports and shows how drive resistances are reported using the report_ports command as shown in the example below:   tempus > set_drive 2.0 [get_ports {in1 in2}]   tempus > report_ports -type drive_resistance -pin [get_ports {in1 in2}]  The following report is displayed:  -----------------------------------------------------------------   Early Late   -----------------------------------------------------------------   Pin     Dir   Assertion       Clock   Rise   Fall   Rise   Fall   Name                          Name   ------------------------------------------------------------------   in1    IN    drive_resistance *(D)(P) 2.000   2.000  2.000  2.000   in2    IN    drive_resistance *(D)(P) 2.000   2.000  2.000  2.000   ------------------------------------------------------------------
