.TH create_partition_wrapper  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreate_partition_wrapper\fR \-  Creates a wrapper partition that embeds the specified partition cell to preserve its verilog module definition in the netlist
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_partition_wrapper\fR  [-help]   -partitions <partition_names>[-pushdown]   [-wrapper_name <wrapper_suffix_string>] 
.P Creates a wrapper partition that embeds the specified partition cell to preserve its verilog module definition in the netlist. The wrapper partition can be used for making netlist changes without changing the netlist of the embedded (wrapped) cell definition.
.P The wrapper partition has the same partition definition attributes as the specified partition. The timing constraints (through SDC) and low power information (through UPF) of the wrapper partition is updated with the correct hierarchical pin information. The pin constraints applied on pins of the original partition are mapped to the new wrapper pins.
.P Note: After the wrapper partition is created using the create_partition_wrapper command: 
.RS  "*" 2 the original partition ceases to exist (deletePartition).  "*" 2 the fence attributes and pin constraints of the original partition are removed.  "*" 2 the module pins of the original partition as preserved such that they cannot be altered later.
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each create_partition_wrapper parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man create_partition_wrapper  "\fB-partitions <partition_names>  \fR" Specifies the name of one or more partitions on which the wrapper is created.  Note: The partition_wrapper will have the same:
.RS  "*" 2 Number, name and locations (If already assigned) of pins  "*" 2 Area, shape, location, orientation
.RE   Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-pushdown\fR" When enabled, it keeps the partition hinst intact for the wrapper partition.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-wrapper_name <wrapper_suffix_string>\fR" Specifies the suffix that is added to a partition name for creating a partition wrapper.  Default: <ptnName>_wrapper  Data_type: string, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command creates a wrapper partition with suffix wrap for all the partitions in the design:
.P create_partition_wrapper -partition * -wrapper_name wrap
