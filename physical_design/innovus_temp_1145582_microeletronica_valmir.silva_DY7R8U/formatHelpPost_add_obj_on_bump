.SH Name \fBadd_obj_on_bump\fR \-  Adds shapes on the TSV bumps
.SH Syntax \fBadd_obj_on_bump\fR  [-help]  {{-cell <bump_cell_name> | -selected | -feedthru } {-relative_pin_layer <pin_layer_name> | -rect {x1 y1 x2 y2} | -polygon {{x1 y1} {x2 y2}...}}}  [-check_only <bump_name> | -write_script <filename>]   {[-shape <layer>+] [-placement_blockage] [-routing_blockage <layer>+] [-physical_pin <layer>+]}   [-shape <layer>+ [-check_only <bump_name>] [-incremental][-shape_keep_net]]   [-feedthru [-cdl_map_file <cdl_map_file_name>]] 
.P Adds shapes on the TSV bumps. You can use this command to add shapes on all the specified TSV bumps or the specified bump. The shape size could be user-defined or same as bump pin on the specified layer. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description of the add_obj_on_bump command usage. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man add_obj_on_bump  "\fB-cdl_map_file <cdl_map_file_name>\fR" Specifies the output cdl map file for LVS.    "\fB-cell <bump_cell_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the bump cell on which the shape is to be added.   "\fB-check_only <bump_name>\fR" Checks if there is a shape on the specified bump and outputs a report file.  The -check_only option cannot be used with -write_script.  Note: The -check_only option can be used only when -shape is specified.   "\fB-feedthru\fR" Adds shapes on the bump that contains the TSV layer and whose net is a feedthrough net.   "\fB-incremental\fR" Adds shapes in the incremental mode. It deletes the shapes without a bump, and adds new shapes on the bumps without shapes. The -incremental parameter only checks the shapes on the same layer.  In the following sequence of commands, the first command is add_obj_on_bump -shape M1 and the second command is  add_obj_on_bump -shape M2 -incremental. In these commands, the layers specified are different. Therefore, add_obj_on_bump will not delete previously added shapes on M1. Also, the result of the command add_obj_on_bump -shape M2 -incremental is the same as add_obj_on_bump -shape M2.  >add_obj_on_bump -shape M1   >add_obj_on_bump -shape M2 -incremental  Note: The -incremental option can be used only when -shape is specified.   "\fB-shape <layer>+\fR" Specifies the layer(s) on which new shapes are to be added.  Polygons with non-45-degree edges are supported.   "\fB-placement_blockage\fR" Adds a placement blockage on bumps. Only orthogonal polygons are supported.   "\fB-physical_pin <layer>+\fR" Specifies the layer(s) on which to add physical pins.  For a single-pin bump, the name of the physical pin is same as that of the target bump. For a multiple-pin bump, the name of the physical pin is same as that of the bump pin on the same layer. If no bump pin exists on the layer specified for adding the physical pin, the tool chooses the name of any of the pins on the target bump as the pin name of the physical pin.  Polygons with non-45-degree edges are supported.   "\fB-polygon {{x1 y1} {x2 y2}...\fR" Specifies the point list of the polygon to add shapes. The center of the specified polygon bounding box aligns with the center of the specified bump cell.   "\fB-rect {x1 y1 x2 y2}\fR" Specifies the rectangle to add shapes. The center of specified rectangle aligns with the center of the specified bump cell.  "\fB-relative_pin_layer <pin_layer_name>\fR" Specifies the pin layer of the pin shape of the specified bump. Adds shapes based on the specified pin shape of the bump.  If the -relative_pin_layer option is specified while adding objects, the shape of the added object is same as the shape of the relative pin.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-routing_blockage <layer>+\fR" Specifies the layer(s) on which to add routing blockages on bumps. Only orthogonal polygons are supported.   "\fB-selected \fR" Adds shapes on the selected bump.   "\fB-shape_keep_net\fR" Keeps the net when adding the layer shape.  When you specify the -incremental option, the tool adds shape with net name if there is no shape with this net on the bump.  "\fB-write_script <filename>\fR" Specifies the file name to dump a Tcl script for adding objects on bumps. If this option is specified, the tool will not add objects on bumps directly.  The -write_script option cannot be used with -check_only. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command adds a shape on layer M1 at the position of the TSV bump whose net is a feedthrough net. The shape on layer M1 is the same as the bump pin shape on layer TSV.  add_obj_on_bump -shape M1 -feedthru -relative_pin_layer TSV
