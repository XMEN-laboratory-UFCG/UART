.SH Name \fBtiming_socv_preserve_variation_with_annotations\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_socv_preserve_variation_with_annotations\fR   {true | false}
.P  Default: false
.P Preserves the sigma value computed by delay calculation along with the annotation from SDC.
.P In the clock mesh flow, it is possible to preserve sigma values even after applying annotation on slew/delay through SDC.
.P When this global variable is set to true, the software accepts the sigma value computed by delay calculation (for nets that have delay/slew annotations from SDC, e.g., clock-mesh), along with the annotation from SDC. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
