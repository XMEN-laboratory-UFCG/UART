.TH timing_extract_model_write_clock_checks_as_arc  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_extract_model_write_clock_checks_as_arc\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_extract_model_write_clock_checks_as_arc\fR  {true | false}
.P Default : false
.P When set to true, the clock checks (min_period and min_pulse_width ) are modelled as arcs in the extracted timing models (ETM). Clock check arcs will be modelled as a single dimensional table with constrained and reference pin as clock pin itself.
.P When set to false, clock checks are modelled as scalar numbers in the extracted ETM.
.P To set this global variable, use set command.
