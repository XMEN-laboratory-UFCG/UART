.SH Name \fBctd_trace\fR \-  Highlights the clock tree path from the clock root to the pin or from one pin to the other if the two pins are on the same path using the specified color or color index
.SH Syntax \fBctd_trace\fR  [-help]  [-color <colorname>]  [-file <fileName>]  [-from <rootclock>]   [-index <colorindex>]  [-to <sink> | -through <instancename>]
.P Highlights the clock tree path from the clock root to the pin or from one pin to the other if the two pins are on the same path using the specified color or color index. The highlighted clock tree path can be viewed in the Clock Tree Viewer of the CCOpt Clock Tree Debugger (CTD). You can also use the Highlight Clock Path option in the context menu of the CTD to highlight the complete clock tree path of a selected pin to the clock root.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ctd_trace parameter.   For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man  ctd_trace.   "\fB-color <colorname>\fR" Specifies the color to be used for highlighting the clock tree path that is being traced.  Default: red  "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the file in which the physical information for each instance and net in the clock path being traced will be dumped.   The following information is saved in the file:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Name is the instance name or the net name  Cell is the instance cell type. This information is only for instances  Status is the place status for an instance and constrain status for a net. For dont_touch nets, the status is 'dont_touch', otherwise this column is left blank  Location is the physical location of the instance or the coordinate of that instance  Wire Length is only for nets  "\fB-from <clockroot>\fR" Specifies the instance name as the starting point of the highlight. If this parameter is not specified, the starting point of the highlight is the clock root of the specified sink.   "\fB-index<colorindex>\fR" Specifies the range of colors that can be used to highlight the clock tree path. Minimum is 1 and maximum is 32.   The range corresponds to the colors in the color picker provided in the Highlight Clock Path option in the context menu of the Clock Tree Viewer.   The number 1 means red, 2 means blue, and so on. An example is shown in the image below.  Default: 1 or red.   "\fB-through <instancename>\fR" Specifies the instance or pin through which the path should be traced.   "\fB-to <sink>\fR" Specifies the end point of the highlighted path.
.P The image below shows the clock tree path highlighted in green, which corresponds to the color index 3. It also shows the color picker with the range of colors included in the color index.
