.TH timing_derate_dynamic_compatibility  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_derate_dynamic_compatibility\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_derate_dynamic_compatibility\fR  {1 | 0} 
.P Default: 1
.P Controls how the set_timing_derate command factors that are not specified, using either -static or -dynamic options, are applied to the delay.
.P When this global is set to 1,  the behavior will be compatible with previous releases. In this mode, the static and dynamic components will be summed up before applying derating.
.P When set to 0, the static and dynamic components will be derated separately and then combined. A setting of 0 is equivalent to using separate derate assertions with the -dynamic and -static options explicitly specified.
.P To set the global variable, use the set command.
