.SH Name \fBeditRotate\fR \-  Flips or rotates selected wires and vias
.SH Syntax \fBeditRotate\fR  [-help]   [-mode {group | single}]  [-rotate_point {<x y>}]  {-flip {MX MY} | -rotate {R90 R180 R270}} 
.P Flips or rotates selected wires and vias. Use this command for more flexible custom routing and fixing DRC violations using existing wires. Using the editRotate command, you can:
.RS  "*" 2 Flip selected wires or vias on the X or Y axis (MX or MY)   "*" 2 Rotate the selected wires or vias by 90, 180, or 270 degrees (R90, R180, or R270). 
.RE
.P The selected object is rotated or flipped based on current orientation, and the lower-left coordinate of the wire/via remains the same after rotation or flip.
.P You can also flip or rotate multiple objects simultaneously as one group.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints the usage of the command. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man editRotate  "\fB-flip {MX MY}    \fR" Flips a wire or via. If you specify MX, the selected object is flipped on the X axis. If you specify MY, the object is flipped on the Y axis.  "\fB-mode {group single}\fR" Rotates multiple selected wires and vias at the same time using the specified mode:
.RS  "*" 2 group - Flips or rotates the selected objects as a group. This is the default mode when multiple objects are selected.   In this mode, the tool flips or rotates the bounding box which encloses all the selected objects.  "*" 2 single - Flips or rotates the selected objects individually.
.RE   "\fB-rotate {R90 R180 R270}\fR" Rotates wires or vias by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, as specified.   "\fB-rotate_point {x y}\fR" Specifies the point around which the wire should be rotated. If this option is not specified, the selected wires/vias are rotated around the lower-left corner of bounding box of wires/vias. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command rotates the selected wire by 90 degrees:  editRotate -rotate R90  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command rotates the selected object, which originally has R90 as its original orientation by 90 degrees:  editRotate -rotate R90  The final orientation of the object will be R180 as shown below:   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command rotates the bounding box of the selected wires by 90 degrees to rotate the wires as one group:   editRotate -rotate R90 -mode group  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command rotates the selected wires individually by 90 degrees:  editRotate -rotate R90 -mode single  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following commands rotate the selected wire by 90 and 180 degrees, respectively, around the specified rotation point, x y:  editRotate -rotate R90 -rotate_point x y  editRotate -rotate R180 -rotate_point x y  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following commands rotate the selected group of wires by 90 and 180 degrees, respectively, around the specified rotation point, x y:  editRotate -rotate R90 -mode group -rotate_point x y  editRotate -rotate R180 -mode group -rotate_point x y  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
