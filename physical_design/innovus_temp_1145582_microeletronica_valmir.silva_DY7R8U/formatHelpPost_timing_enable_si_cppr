.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_si_cppr\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_enable_si_cppr\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: true
.P Enables more accurate CPPR analysis when incremental delays are present and the timing_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism global variable is set to true.
.P When set to true, the incremental delay is not included in the CPPR calculation during setup analysis, but is included in the CPPR calculation during hold analysis.
.P When set to false, the incremental delay is included in both setup and hold CPPR calculations. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
