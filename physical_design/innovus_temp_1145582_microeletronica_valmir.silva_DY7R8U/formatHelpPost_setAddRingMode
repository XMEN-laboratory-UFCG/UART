.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setAddRingMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man setAddRingMode  "\fB-avoid_short {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to prevent a ring or a ring segment from being created if it would cause a short violation to occur. Specify 1 to prevent the creation of rings that would cause a short violation. Specify 0 to enable the creation of rings that cause a short violation.   Default:  false  "\fB-break_core_ring_io_list io_list\fR" Breaks or excludes core rings for specific instances.   "\fB-continue_on_no_selection {true | false} \fR" If the design has no power domain, or no fences are selected, addRing ignores the option -around power_domain and generates core rings.  Default: false  "\fB-detailed_log {true|false}\fR" Setting this option will make addRing, addStripe output an extensive log or a detailed log.  Default: false  "\fB-extend_blockring_search_distance <distance>\fR" Extends the block ring search a specified distance beyond the initial block ring target to enable the connection of multiple block ring targets. For example, if VDD consists of three bits (segments) running parallel to one another, each having a width of two microns and a spacing between them of one micron, using this variable with a specified distance of eight microns will extend the block ring search a distance of eight microns to enable a connection to the multiple block ring targets. The <distance>is specified as the measured distance from the first to last bits. Units in microns.  Note: You must specify this variable before using the addRing command. When using the command, you must include the following parameters:  -use_wire_group_bits 1  -use_wire_group 1  "\fB-extend_corering_search_distance <distance>\fR" Specifies the wire group search distance for connecting all bits of the wire group stripes.  Default: 0.0  "\fB-extend_merge_with_prewires {true | false}\fR" Automatically merges newly-created ring wires with same net pre-routed wires.  Default: true  "\fB-extend_over_row {true | false}\fR" If 1 is specified, the cut row is not considered a blockage by the addRing command, which generates the ring over the cut row. If 0 is specified, the cut row is considered a blockage and the ring is not generated over the row. Rings are created based on the parameters that you specify in the addRings command.  Default: false  "\fB-extend_search_nets {* | {net_names}}\fR" Specifies the net names to append to the wire group search distance properties.   "\fB-extend_stripe_search_distance <distance>\fR" Specifies the wire group search distance for connecting all bits of the wire group core rings.  Default: 0.0  "\fB-gap_width_without_io  width\fR" Specifies the max missing IO Pads area width between IO Pads.  Default: 0  "\fB-ignore_rows {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether the power planning software ignores all rows (cut rows and native rows) when rings are created. Specify 1 to create rings that ignore rows. Specify  0 to create rings that do not ignore rows.  Default:   false  "\fB-max_via_size {<shape width% height% target_penetration%>}\fR" The maximum size of a crossover via, specified as a percentage of a full-size via. You must specify three values for each shape that you specify. The type values are:
.RS  "*" 2 Pad
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Ring
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Stripe
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Blockring
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Blockpin
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Cover
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Noshape
.RE   The three values you must specify for each shape are:
.RS  "*" 2 The maximum width for the crossover via, as a percentage of a full-size via
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The maximum height for the crossover via, as a percentage of a full-size via
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The target penetration, which specifies a smaller size for vias connecting to targets of the specified shape.
.RE   "\fB-orthogonal_only {true | false}\fR" Creates vias only for orthogonal wires and pin intersections.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter or if you specify it with a value true, the software only creates vias for orthogonal wires and pin intersections.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all parameters to their default values. Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset. will be reported.  "\fB-ring_target {core_ring | default | first_ring | pad_ring | stripe}\fR"  "\fBcore_ring\fR" Ring wires can consider core rings as targets, even when core rings are inside the I/O pad area.  Only rings are considered targets.  "\fBpad_ring\fR" Ring wires can be extended to pad rings.   "\fBfirst_ring\fR" Ring wires consider either the first core ring or the pad ring as a target.   "\fBstripe\fR" Both rings and stripes are considered targets.
.P Note: You can specify that rings are extended to both pad rings and to stripes. To do this you must specify the ring_target parameter twice, as show in the following example:   -ring_target stripe  -ring_target pad_ring  "\fB-skip_crossing_trunks {horizontal | vertical | none}\fR" Removes the horizontal or vertical portion of rings (shared or inside edges) when used in conjunction with the addRing -block_rings -around shared_cluster command.  "\fB-skip_via_on_pin {[Pad] [Block] [Cover] [Standardcell] [Physicalpin]}\fR" Prevents vias from being generated on the specified types of pins.  If you specify -skip_via_on_pin {}, the power planning software makes connections to all five categories of pins.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, vias are generated for block pins, pad pins, and cover macro pins, but are not generated for standard cell pins.  "\fB-skip_via_on_wire_shape {blockring | stripe | followpin | corewire | blockwire | iowire | padring | ring | fillwire | noshape}\fR" Prevents vias from being generated on the specified wire shapes.  If you specify -skip_via_on_wire_shape {}, the power planning software makes connections to all five categories of wire shapes.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, vias can be generated on all wire shapes except no-shape wires.  "\fB-spacing_from_block<value>\fR" To be used together with -break_core_ring_io_list <io list>to specify the spacing from block.  "\fB-split_long_via {<threshold_value step_value offset_value height_value>}\fR" Splits vias longer than the specified length (threshold_value, in micrometers) into smaller vias with specified center-to-center spacing (step_value, in micrometers), left/bottom end offset (offset_value, in micrometers) and vertical/horizontal height (height_value, in micrometers) values
. This is independent of the option -split_via.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the software does not split vias.  Note: If the offset_value is given as negative, the vias will be placed symmetrically on both ends. The default value of offset_value is -1.  "\fB-stacked_via_bottom_layer <layername>\fR" Specifies the lowest layer in which vias can be stacked.  Default: The lowest metal layer in the design.  "\fB-stacked_via_top_layer <layername>\fR" Specifies the highest layer in which vias can be stacked.  Default: The highest metal layer in the design.  "\fB-wire_center_offset{true | false}\fR" Used for calculating the offset. When set to 1 addRing will use wire centre. When set to 0, addRing will use wire boundary.  Default: false  "\fB-via_using_exact_crossover_size {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to generate partial vias of the exact crossover size. A value of 1 allows partial vias to be generated. A value of 0 prevents partial vias, and the software always generates full-size vias.  Default: true 
.SH Example
.P The following command specifies that rings can use stripes as targets and that the rings generated around clusters of block rings with shared edges do not have horizontal wires between the blocks.
