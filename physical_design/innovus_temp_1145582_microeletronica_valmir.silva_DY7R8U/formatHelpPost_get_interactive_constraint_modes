.SH Name \fBget_interactive_constraint_modes\fR \-  Returns a list of the multi-mode multi-corner constraint modes that are in interactive constraint entry mode
.SH Syntax \fBget_interactive_constraint_modes\fR  [-help]  
.P Returns a list of the multi-mode multi-corner constraint modes that are in interactive constraint entry mode.
.P When the software is in interactive constraint entry mode (set_interactive_constraint_modes), any timing constraints you specify take effect immediately on all active analysis views that are associated with these constraint modes.
.P Note: Interactive constraint mode only works when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner timing analysis mode.
