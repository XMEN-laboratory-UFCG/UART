.SH Name \fBcheck_timing\fR \-  Performs a variety of consistency and completeness checks on the timing constraints specified for a design. 
.P The checks include arrival time and external delay (or required time) for each clock in a multiple clock system
.SH Syntax \fBcheck_timing\fR  [-type <type_list>]   [-verbose]  [-check_only <warning_list>]   [-include_warning <warning_list>]   [-exclude_warning <warning_list>]   [-view <analysis_view_name>]   [<port_or_pin_list>]  [-tcl_list]  [{> | >> } <file_name>[.gz]]  
.P Performs a variety of consistency and completeness checks on the timing constraints specified for a design. 
.P The checks include arrival time and external delay (or required time) for each clock in a multiple clock system. In addition, clock connectivity and data connectivity are checked to make sure the clock or data is propagated as expected. Clock gating points are also reported.
.P Use this command on generic or mapped netlists. The check_timing command considers constants applied to a pin while reporting warnings.    Note: Use the check_timing command before using any commands for timing analysis. Warnings are displayed when problems occur. Refer to checkTimingWarningMessagescheck_timing warnings. For best results, rerun the check_timing command after resolving each warning. Redirecting the output to a file is the quickest run method. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-check_only  <warning_list>\fR" Allows you to specify warning types. For example, the following command lists the specified warnings only:  check_timing -check_only {uncons_endpoint clock_crossing}  This list can also include warnings that are not listed by default.  Valid entries in warning_list are:  clock_clipping_freq, clock_clipping_gate, clock_crossing, clock_expected, clock_gating_controlling_edge_unknown, clock_gating_no_data, clock_missing_at_sequential_output, clock_not_propagated, clocks_masked_by_another_clock, const_collision, data_check_multiple_reference_signal, data_check_no_reference_signal, ideal_clock_waveform, invalid_pll_configuration, loop, master_clk_edge_not_reaching, missing_clock_groups, missing_drive, multiple_clock, no_drive, no_gen_clock_source, no_input_delay, partial_input_delay, pulse_non-pulse_clock_merge, signal_level, uncons_endpoint, uncons_endpoints_due_to_case_analysis  "\fB{> | >>}  <file_name>\fR" When specified with >, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.  The <filename> parameter must be the last argument in the list. The <filename>and -tcl_list parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  Note: To write a compressed report, add the
.gz extension to the file name.  Default: Report is displayed on standard output without being saved.  "\fB-exclude_warning  <warning_list>\fR" Excludes the specified warning types when generating the report. Use this parameter to exclude any of the warnings included in the report by default.  By default, the software includes the following warnings in the report: clock_expected, loop, ideal_clock_waveform, master_clk_edge_not_reaching, partial_input_delay, no_input_delay, no_drive, no_gen_clock_source, uncons_endpoint,uncons_endpoints_due_to_case_analysis.  The complete list of warnings and their descriptions is given in checkTimingWarningMessagescheck_timing warnings.  "\fB-include_warning  <warning_list>\fR" Includes the specified warning types when generating the report. Use this parameter to add any of the warnings not included in the report by default.  By default, the software reports all warnings except the following: clock_clipping_gate, const_collision, clock_crossing,clock_not_propagated, missing_drive, multiple_clock, data_check_multiple_reference_signal, data_check_no_reference_signal, clock_gating_no_data, clock_gating_controlling_edge_unknown, clock_missing_at_sequential_output, signal_level, clocks_masked_by_another_clock.  The complete list of warnings and their descriptions is given in
.  "\fB<port_or_pin_list>\fR" Lists pins or ports. For example:  check_timing -verbose [get_ports in*]  "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Produces the report in Tcl list format instead of a tabular format. This is useful for integrating timing with custom Tcl functions, and also for customizing report generation.  The -tcl_list and <filename> parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  "\fB-type  <type_list>\fR" Limits the checks to the specified type. Valid types are: clocks, endpoints, inputs, nets, loops, clock_clipping, clock_gating_inferred, and constant_collision.  Default: All types. Only check violations will be reported.  To report all the checks you can use the timing_check_timing_report_all_checksglobal variable. When set to true, the software reports all the checks performed by the check_timing command, even if there are no violations. By default, this global variable is set to false. clocks: Reports the following clock warnings:
.RS  "*" 2 clock_crossing
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 clock_expected
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 clock_not_propagated
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 ideal_clock_waveform
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 master_clk_edge_not_reaching
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 no_gen_clock_source
.RE  endpoints: For output ports, warns if no output delay constraint is applied to the port or if a specific (min/max rise/fall) output delay is missing. It also warns if an output delay constraint is applied with no clock information.  For all endpoints (output ports and register data pins), it warns if any incoming signal is unconstrained.  Also warns if a clock arrives where clock is not expected, or if multiple signals arrive at an endpoint. inputs: Reports the following input delay, arrival time assertion, and drive assertion warnings:
.RS  "*" 2 partial_input_delay
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 missing_drive
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 no_input_delay
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 no_drive
.RE  nets:  loops: Warns when a combinational loop is detected. Reports the loop and the arc used to break the loop. The -pin option is ignored in this case.  Also reports loops caused by generated clocks. clock_clipping: Warns when there is a problem with clock gating that can result in clock clipping.  Reports the following warnings:
.RS  "*" 2 clock_clipping_freq
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 clock_clipping_gate
.RE  clock_gating_inferred: Warns when inferred clock gating checks are not analyzed by the software, even if a clock signal reaches and is used downstream the clock tree.  Reports the following warnings.
.RS  "*" 2 clock_gating_controlling_edge_unknown
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 clock_gating_no_data
.RE  constant_collision: Warns when there is a constant collision on a net connected to the pin or if there is a contradiction on a pin.  Constant collision occurs when a net is driven simultaneously by conflicting values and a constant contradiction occurs when a constant constraint on a pin conflicts with the driven value.  "\fB-verbose\fR" Gives detailed information about the warnings. When specified, warnings are grouped and sorted by warning type.  Default: Gives a summary of how many warnings of each type exists.  "\fB-view\fR" Reports warning(s) that belong to the specified analysis view. 
.SH Command Order
.P Use this command after setting all the constraints but before optimizing your design or generating any timing reports. 
.SH Warning Messages
.P The following table shows the check_timing warning messages. 
.P check_timing Warning Messages     "\fBWarning\fR" Description  "\fB clock_clipping_gate\fR" Warning: Clock clipping possible due to wrong gate type or wrong trigger for data input.  "\fB clock_clipping_freq\fR" Warning: Clock clipping possible due to incompatible clock signal and data signal frequencies.  "\fB clock_crossing\fR" Warning: Clock domains interact.  Comments: Checks clock interactions between multiple clock domains in the design.  When you specify this parameter, the Timing Check Crossing Clocks report shows the interaction of clocks in the design and indicates whether the paths between the clocks are False or Partial False.  If a clock launches one or more paths, which are captured by other clocks, the report lists all pairs of crossing clocks.
.RS  "*" 2 This includes inferred clock gating with different reference and signal clock.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If a path has been disabled using the set_disable_timing command, crossing clocks on that path are not reported.
.RE   If all the paths between two clocks are false paths or they are exclusive/asynchronous clocks, the path is marked as False. The false path can be defined on clocks, for example, set_false_path -clock_to  CLK or on pins or ports, such as, -through buf1/Y.  If only part of paths are set as false paths or exclusive/asynchronous clocks, the path is marked as Partial False.
.RS  "*" 2 If a false path is defined only for one check type (say, setup), the crossing clocks are marked as Partial False if the simultaneous setup hold mode is set to on. The crossing clocks are marked False if the analysis type is setup and the simultaneous setup hold mode is set to off.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If only one edge (rise/fall) of a particular clock pair has false paths (say, using -clock_fall), then the path is marked as a Partial False.
.RE   "\fB clock_expected\fR" Warning: Clock not found where clock is expected.  Comments: Indicates that no clock signal is defined at the clock pin.  See create_clock.  "\fB clock_gating_controlling_edge_unknown \fR" Warning: Unknown controlling edge to perform clock gating check.  Comments: Reports library cells with complex functions (MUX or AOI ) where controlling edge of signal to perform clock gating check cannot be determined automatically.  You need to specify correct edge by -high/-low option using the set_clock_gating_check command to resolve such warning.  Note: The software does not report this warning when either:
.RS  "*" 2 set_disable_clock_gating_check command is applied on such pins, or
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 global settings to disable clock gating checks are on.
.RE   "\fB clock_gating_no_data\fR" Warning: No data signal reaching clock gating enable pin  Comments: Reports clock gating enable pins where no valid data signal arrives.  You need to do either of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 specify valid data signal to reach enable pin of clock gating cells, or
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 remove any path exceptions or disabled checks that blocks valid data signal to reach enable pin
.RE   Note: The software does not report this warning when either
.RS  "*" 2 set_disable_clock_gating_check is applied on such pins, or
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 global settings to disable clock gating checks are on.
.RE   "\fBclocks_masked_by_another_clock \fR" Warning: Clock(s) in fanin cone are dropped due to another clock  Comments: Reported timing pins on which creation of a regular or a generated clock causes clock(s) in fanins of such pins have been blocked or masked from propagating further.  However, for pins having only master clock waveform on the fanin, this warning is not reported.  You can use the detailed mode (-verbose option) to report names of all the incoming clock waveforms that have been blocked.  "\fBclock_missing_at_sequential_output \fR" Warning: Found latency phase at sequential output on clock tree instead of clock phase  Comments: Reports output pins of sequential elements that lie on source clock tree for the generated clocks created downstream and do not have any valid clock phase. This indicates possible missing clock related checks (e.g., clock gating) on downstream clock tree.  You can add clocks on this pin or downstream clock tree only if no valid clock exists until downstream generated clock creation point.  "\fB clock_not_propagated\fR" Warning: Clock not propagated  Comments: Reports ideal clocks reaching the reference pin of a timing check.  "\fB const_collision\fR" Warning: Constant collision  Comments: See set_case_analysis.  "\fBdata_check_multiple_reference_signal\fR" Warning: Multiple clocked signals are reaching data check reference pin  Comments: Reports on reference pins for non sequential timing check (data check) where more than one reference data arrives.  "\fBdata_check_no_reference_signal \fR" Warning: No clocked signal is reaching data check reference pin  Comments: Reports reference pins for non- sequential timing check (data check) where no valid reference signal (data phase) arrives.  You can do one of the following to resolve such warnings:
.RS  "*" 2 add valid reference signals to reach at such reference pins
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 remove path exceptions or disabled arcs that are blocking such reference signals
.RE   "\fB ideal_clock_waveform\fR" Warning: Clock waveform is ideal.  Comments: Reports clocks that are ideal and are not propagated. This warning type is reported by default (unless -exclude_warning or -check_only parameter is specified).  You can use the set_propagated_clock command to avoid this warning.  "\fB               invalid_pll_configuration             \fR" Warning: No valid path exists from output pin to feedback pin of PLL.  Comments: Shows PLL (phase locked loop) check warnings. These checks allow you to identify and fix issues in the PLL flow.  "\fBlatch_fanout_clock_connectivity\fR" Warning: Latch and its fanout latch work on same clock.  Comments: Checks for a latch and its fanout latch(es) that works on the same clock.  "\fB loop\fR" Warning: Timing loop found in the design.  Comments: Indicates that there are timing loops in the design. It also includes loops caused by generated clocks.  "\fBmaster_clk_edge_not_reaching\fR" Warning: Master clock edge does not reach the generated clock target.  Comments: This warning means that rise/fall latency edge is not reaching to create generated clock root from the master clock. You can verify if the path that is  seeing this warning is actually broken, or edge is somewhere disabled earlier on this path. There is a global timing_enable_genclk_edge_based_source_latency that controls how the software chooses generated clock source latency paths. Details of this global can be found at Tempus text command reference.  "\fBmissing_clock_groups\fR" Warning: Set clock group related checking.  Comments: Reports any potential issues with the defined clock grouping data.  "\fB partial_input_delay\fR" Warning: Indicates that a rise or fall input delay assertion is not applied.  "\fB missing_drive\fR" Warning: Missing specific (rise/fall) drive constraint  Comments: Either a rise or fall drive constraint is applied and the other one is missing.  "\fBmultiple_clock\fR" Warning: Multiple clocks are reaching clock reference pin.  Comments: Reports clock pins of sequential or clock gating cells where more than one clock waveform arrives.  This warning is for information only and the software performs timing analysis with respect to all such clocks.  "\fB no_input_delay\fR" Warning: No input delay assertion with or without -clock option specified.  Comments: See set_input_delay.  "\fB no_drive\fR" Warning: No drive constraint  Comments: See set_driving_cell and set_drive.  "\fB no_gen_clock_source\fR" Warning: No clock source found for generated clock.  Comments: Indicates that the source pin of the clock generated by the create_clock command is not driven by a clock source.  "\fBpulse_non-pulse_clock_merge\fR" Warning: Merge of pulse and non-pulse clock paths.  Comments: Reports points where a pulse clock and a non-pulse clock merges.  "\fB signal_level\fR" Warning: Driver pin voltage value do not match with sink pin voltage level  Comments: Reports net driver/receiver pin pairs for which the pin voltage does not match.  "\fB uncons_endpoint\fR" Warning: No constrained signal reaching pin.  Comments: For output ports: Primary output port has no implicit timing check. Use set_output_delay, set_max_delay, or set_min_delay to create a valid constraint.  For register data pins: There is no valid clock reaching the CK pin of the register data pin. Check for missing create_clock for the clock network.  The endpoints are reported as unconstrained in both in early and late timing. This does not cover all the cases and scenarios  because of which endpoint can become unconstrained. To cover all possible cases, you can use the  report_analysis_coverage  command.  "\fBuncons_endpoints_due_to_case_analysis\fR" Warning: Unconstrained signal arriving at end point due to case analysis  Comments: Reports unconstrained endpoints due to case analysis.  To enable this warning, you must set the timing_report_check_timing_unconstrained_endpoints_due_to_constants global variable to true.
