.TH add_gui_shape  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBadd_gui_shape\fR \-  Adds a shape to the default or specified custom layer
.SH Syntax \fBadd_gui_shape\fR  [-help]  [-layer <layerName>]  [-name <guiShapeName>]  [-width <width>]   {-rect {x1 y1 x2 y2} | -line {x1 y1 x2 y2
...} | -polygon {x1 y1 x2 y2
...}}   [-line {x1 y1 x2 y2
...} [-arrow ] ] 
.P Adds a shape to the default or specified custom layer. You can use the add_gui_shape command at any point in the design flow. The shapes added by the command annotate comment shapes and do not show up in the DEF output.
.P Note: In OpenAccess flows, the shapes added with the add_gui_shape command are stored in the OpenAccess cellview. However, the shapes are stored in a private structure that is accessible only to Innovus. To create shapes that are visible in Virtuoso as well, use the add_shape command instead.  
.SH  Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each add_gui_shape parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man add_gui_shape  "\fB-arrow\fR" Draws an arrow in the middle of the line segment to indicate the start to end direction. This parameter can only be used with -line.   "\fB-layer <layerName>\fR" Specifies the GUI layer name to use or create for the shape. If the specified layer does not exist, it is created automatically.   If a layer is not specified, the tool automatically creates a layer with the name defaultLayer and adds the shape to it.  "\fB-line {<x1 y1 x2 y2
...>}\fR" Creates a line, with x1 y1 x2 y2
... specifying the coordinates for the line segments. The values are specified in microns.  "\fB-name <guiShapeName>\fR" Specifies the name of the GUI shape.   "\fB-polygon {<x1 y1 x2 y2>
...}\fR" Creates a polygon shape, with x1 y1 x2 y2
... specifying the coordinates for the polygon segments. The values are specified in microns.   "\fB-rect {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right points of the rectangle. The values are specified in microns.  "\fB-width <width>\fR" Specifies the width of the shape border in pixels. The minimum (default) value is 1 and the maximum is  7. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command adds a triangular shape in layer 1:  add_gui_shape -layer 1 -polygon {95.841 -645 96.592 -644.147 96.926 -644.777}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
