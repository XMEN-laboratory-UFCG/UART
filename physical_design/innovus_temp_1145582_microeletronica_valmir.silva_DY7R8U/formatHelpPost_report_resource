.SH Name \fBreport_resource\fR \-  Displays the peak memory used during a software session
.SH Syntax \fBreport_resource\fR   [-help]   [-peak]  [-verbose]   [-start <string> | [-end <string> [-session_cpu]   [-diff_memory]]]  [-check_MemCpu {true | false} [-period <integer>]] 
.P Displays the peak memory used during a software session. This command is used to measure the peak memory at any given point in the flow and and make the script better for automation flows.
.P Note: The report_resource command is only supported in the 64-bit version of the software and Linux port. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.  "\fB-check_MemCpu {true | false}\fR" Checks the machine's physical memory and CPU resources. When specified, the software enables memory/CPU checking and reports a warning if the free memory is below 5 percent of the total memory or if the average CPU load large.   "\fB-diff_memory\fR" Outputs different peak memory and current memory between the step start and step end.   "\fB-end <string>\fR" Specifies the end point to measure the peak memory attained during a specific command.   "\fB-peak\fR" Reports current peak memory till a given point in a flow. This parameter also works with the -start and -end parameters of the report_resource command so that peak memory observed by an individual command can be reported.  "\fB-period <integer>\fR" Specifies the period for checking the physical memory and CPU usage.  Default: 1800s  Min: 1  Max: INT_MAX  "\fB<->start <string>\fR" Specifies the start point to measure the peak memory attained during a specific command.  Note: The <->start and <->end parameters support any user-specified string, such as fullFlow, timeDesign, and TD_PR. You must specify the same string for both the -start and -end parameters to measure the peak memory attained during a specific command.  "\fB-session_cpu\fR" Reports the current CPU and real time after the reports last step status.  "\fB-verbose\fR" Gives detailed memory usage information. It displays how much memory is being used at any time and of what form (physical vs. virtual). When specified, the following information is displayed:
.RS  "*" 2 Cpu(s) is the number of available processors in the machine.  "*" 2 Load average is the system load averages for the last 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes.  "*" 2 Mem and Swap are the current memory information of the machine.  "*" 2 Data Resident Set (DRS)is the amount of physical memory devoted to other than executable code. "current mem" shows this value (Total current DRS)
.  "*" 2 Private Dirty (DRT) is the memory which must be written to disk before the corresponding physical memory location can be used for some other virtual page. "peak res"  shows this value (Total peak DRT). This is the minimum number that you must reserve to run the program.  "*" 2 Virtual Size (VIRT) is the total  amount  of virtual memory used by the task.  "*" 2 Resident Size (RES) is the non-swapped physical memory a task has used. The number of  "Total Peak RES" is the recommended physical memory to reserve.
