.SH Name \fBtrimMetalFill\fR \-  Trims metal fill and via fill (FILLWIRE and FILLWIREOPC shapes) that causes DRC violations
.SH Syntax \fBtrimMetalFill\fR  [-help]   [-allowPolygon]   [-area <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>]   [-deleteViol]   [-ignoreSpecialNet]   [-layer {<layer_num_list> | <layer_name_list>}]   [-useNonDefaultSpacing] 
.P Trims metal fill and via fill (FILLWIRE and FILLWIREOPC shapes) that causes DRC violations. This command uses the values set by the setMetalFill command. Therefore, you must ensure that you have correct setMetalFill settings before running trimMetalFill to avoid false violations.
.P Note: Use setMetalFill without -iterationName or with -iterationName default to set the DRC rules used by trimMetalFill. setMetalFill -iterationName <name>, where <name> is other than default, is used to set construction rules used by addMetalFill with the -iterationNameList option.
.P Use this command to trim metal fill if the design has floating metal or via fill. By trimming the fill, you reduce the chance of introducing timing problems caused by cross-coupling.
.P If the design has metal or via fill that is connected to special nets, use fixOpenFill after using trimMetalFill.
.P Use the trimMetalFill command after routing signal nets. For more information, see Route Commands. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each trimMetalFill parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use man trimMetalFill.  "\fB-allowPolygon\fR" Allows rectilinear shapes after trimming metal fill (FILLWIRE and FILLWIREOPC shapes).  By default, the Innovus software supports rectangular shapes only.  "\fB-area <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>\fR" Specifies a set of coordinates within which metal fill needs to be trimmed. By limiting the area in which metal fill is trimmed, you can speed up the trimming process.  Note: This option is recommended for use with only floating metal fill. If you use trimMetalFill -area on tied-off fill shapes, the command returns a warning message that some of the shapes may become isolated from the Power/Ground network.  "\fB-deleteViol\fR" Deletes metal fill shapes that cause DRC violations or shorts, instead of trimming sections of the shapes. After running the trimMetalFill command with this parameter specified, the remaining shapes are still rectangles. If using this parameter causes metal density to drop below the target density, re-run the addMetalFill command.  Always specify this parameter in the following two cases:
.RS  "*" 2 If the design has minimum step rules, specify this parameter to avoid creating minimum step violations.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If you ran addMetalFill -snap, specify this parameter to delete entire shapes, instead of trimming sections of the shapes, otherwise the trimmed shapes will not be on-grid.
.RE   "\fB-ignoreSpecialNet\fR" Ignores special nets while checking for DRC violations.  "\fB-layer {<layer_num_list> | <layer_name_list>}\fR" Specifies the metal layers in which metal fill needs to be trimmed.  Note: This option is recommended for use with only floating metal fill. If you use trimMetalFill -layer on tied-off fill shapes, the command returns a warning message that some of the shapes may become isolated from the Power/Ground network.  "\fB-useNonDefaultSpacing\fR" Uses non-default spacing for trimming metal fill. Some critical nets use a non-default rule (NDR) for routing as they may need to have wider wires or wider spacing than other nets. Use -useNonDefaultSpacing to extend NDR control to trimMetalFill. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands trim metal fill after ECO routing.   setNanoRouteMode -route_with_eco true  globalDetailRoute  trimMetalFill
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command trims metal fill and allows rectilinear shapes:   trimMetalFill -allowPolygon
