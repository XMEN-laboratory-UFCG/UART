.SH Name \fBsetSdpMode\fR \-  Sets SDP-related sticky options before using commands like placeSdpGroup and place_design
.SH Syntax \fBsetSdpMode\fR  [-help]   [-clock_location {bottom|center}]   [-disable_extended_core {true|false}]  [-honor_dont_use {true|false}]  [-honor_orient {true|false}]   [-legalization {NONE|SW|SE|NW|NE|AUTO}]  [-legalization_effort {low|medium|high}]  [-max_move_distance <value>]   [-num_column <numberOfCol>]   [-place_report <file_name>]   [-pre_fixed_cells_blockage_direction {NONE|X|Y}]   [-reset] 
.P Sets SDP-related sticky options before using commands like placeSdpGroup and place_design. You can use the setSdpMode command to disable extension of core boundary before running the placeSdpGroup command. You can also use this command to generate a detailed SDP placement report.
.P Before setting SDP options with setSdpMode, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Imported the design
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each setSdpMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setSdpMode.  "\fB-clock_location {bottom | center}\fR" Specifies where the Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cell will be placed in an SDP register column.  Default: center  "\fB-disable_extended_core {true | false}\fR" Disables extension of the core boundary. If you set -disable_extended_core to true before running the placeSdpGroup command, the software does not adjust the core boundary to accommodate all SDP placements. Instead, the software places the SDP elements outside the core boundary if they do not fit within the boundary.  Default: true  "\fB-honor_dont_use {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether the dont_use attribute on base cells should be honored by the placeSdpGroup command during EEQ swapping in SDP legalization. By default, placeSdpGroup takes all cells into account. If -honor_dont_use is set to true, placeSdpGroup ignores cells with the dont_use attribute.  Default: false  "\fB-honor_orient {true|false}\fR" Honors user-specified orientation during legalization.  User-specified orientation can be set using the setSdpGroupAttribute command. You can use the getSdpGroupAttribute command to check the current orientation setting. Note that the SDP writer writes out orientation information only if its value is defined by the user through the SDP file or TCL command.  Default: false  "\fB-legalization {NONE|SW|SE|NW|NE|AUTO}\fR" Specifies the corner of the SDP box that will be kept fixed while legalizing an SDP instance.  Default: NONE  "\fB-legalization_effort {low|medium|high}\fR" Specifies the legalization effort in placing SDP groups.  When you run placeSdpGroup, the SDP groups are legalized on the basis of their order, which is determined by their size. Bigger SDP groups are placed first, and multiple iterations are used to place and align the remaining SDP groups. You can also control the legalization effort applied by using the -legalization_effort parameter. The higher the setting of this parameter, the more the number of iterations attempted to try and place the SDP groups legally.  Default: low  "\fB-max_move_distance <value>\fR" Specifies how far an SDP can be moved from its original clustering location to resolve overlaps. By default, this value is half the perimeter of the core box. The Manhattan distance between the new and original locations of the SDP must be less than the value of the -max_move_distance option.   The -max_move_distance option is honored by the refinePlace command. SDP columns start at the center-of-mass of the instances and then try to find a legal location without overlaps.  Default: 0  "\fB-num_column <numberOfCol>\fR" Specifies the number of flip flop columns for each SDP group.  Default: 2  "\fB-place_report <file_name>\fR" Generates a detailed SDP placement report when placeSdpGroup is run.  Default: If setSdpMode -place_report has not been specified before running placeSdpGroup, this report is not generated.  Note: To disable the -place_report option once it has been specified, specify <file_name> as a null string (""). The detailed SDP placement report will not be generated subsequently.  "\fB-pre_fixed_cells_blockage_direction {NONE|X|Y}\fR" Creates temporary placement blockage internally over pre-fixed cells (that is, well tap or power switch cells) in X or Y direction to prevent SDP cells to be placed in the horizontal or vertical empty spaces when resolving overlapping.  The illustration below shows the difference between SDP placement without this setting and with -pre_fixed_cells_blockage_direction set to Y.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Default: NONE  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified options to default value
