.TH set_cell_power_domain  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_cell_power_domain\fR \-  Defines domains for multi-VDD and multi-VSS cells
.SH Syntax \fBset_cell_power_domain\fR  [-help]  [-reset]  [-file <file_name>] 
.P Defines domains for multi-VDD and multi-VSS cells. When reading an instance ASCII power file to perform power-rail analysis, if there are missing power values associated with ground pins, the software uses the information specified with the set_cell_power_domain command to derive domain association and distributes power to each ground net accordingly.
.P This domain information is stored in a side file that is used by power analysis to calculate power using the correct voltage for each domain. If you are specifying an external instance ASCII power file with pin information, this domain information is used to correctly distribute power to each pin.
.P Use this command before performing power and rail analysis.
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the file containing the cell names and corresponding power-ground pairs.  The format of the file is:  CELL: <<cell name1>>  <<power1>> <<gnd1>>  <<power2>> <gnd2>  CELL: <<cell name2>>  <<power1>> <<gnd1>> 
...  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description for the set_cell_power_domain parameter.  For a detailed description of the command, use the man command: man set_cell_power_domain.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all specified options back to default values. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies a file domain_file for the cell mycell having multiple power and ground pins (VDD at 1v and VDDm at 0.84v):  set_cell_power_domain -file domain_file  The following is a snippet from domain_file:  CELL: mycell  VDD_1v  VSS_1v  VDDm_0.84v  VSSm_0.84v
