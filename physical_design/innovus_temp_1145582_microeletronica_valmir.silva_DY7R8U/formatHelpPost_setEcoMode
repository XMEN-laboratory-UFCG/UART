.P Controls certain behaviors of the ecoAddRepeater, ecoChangeCell, and ecoDeleteRepeater ECO commands.
.P Use the getEcoMode command to return the current settings for the setEcoMode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setEcoMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setEcoMode.  "\fB-addPortAsNeeded {true|false}\fR" Controls whether timing optimization adds ports to the lower-level hierarchies of the design. It only works during ECO and overwrites the value of setOptMode -addPortAsNeeded for the ECO commands, ecoAddRepeater, ecoChangeCell, and ecoDeleteRepeater.  Default: true  "\fB-batchMode {true|false}\fR" Speeds up the runtime in case the user performs lots of interactive ECO operations. When the user specifies batchMode true, various ECO operations are performed in a batch and initialization steps are not performed for every ECO call. In addition, updating timing is performed only once for all the ECO operations. Tool will only perform timing initialization at the first ECO command in the batch mode and timing update at the time of exiting the batchMode. User needs to specify batchMode false to exit the batchMode.  The batch mode is activated by setEcoMode -batchMode true and exited by setEcoMode -batchMode false, and only ecoAddRepeater , ecoDeleteRepeater and ecoChangeCell could be given in between setEcoMode -batchMode true and  setEcoMode -batchMode false:  setEcoMode -batchMode true  eco commands (ecoAddRepeater, ecoDeleteRepeater, ecoChangeCell)   setEcoMode -batchMode false  If a user activates the batch mode, then the user needs to remember to exit it. If the user does not exit the batch mode, the user might see some unexpected results.  The refinePlace command will not be called in batchMode. It will be called when the tool exits the batchMode and if refinePlace is set to true.  All other setEcoMode settings should be made prior to activating batch mode. If you would like to change setEcoMode settings, you need to exit the batch mode first.  Note: This option supports all commit ECO commands. Evaluation commands are not supported.   "\fB-delayCalcEffort  <effort_level>\fR" Specifies the delay calculation effort level { low | medium | high } used in timing update.  Default: high  "\fB-honorDontTouch {true|false}\fR" Checks for the don't touch attribute on nets and instances. If you specify a terminal list, this parameter checks each terminal for the don't touch attribute. The ecoAddRepeater command honors the don't touch nets. The ecoDeleteRepeater and ecoChangeCell commands honor don't touch instances.  Default: true  "\fB-honorDontUse {true|false}\fR" Checks for the don't use attribute on cells. The ecoAddRepeater, ecoDeleteRepeater, and ecoChangeCell commands honor don't use cells.  Default: true  "\fB-honorFixedNetWire {true|false}\fR" Checks for fixed net wires.  It restricts the addition or deletion on fixed net so that the fixed status of the wires is not altered.  Default: true  When -honorFixedNetWire is set to false, ecoAddRepeater can insert a cell on the wires with the FIXED/COVER status and change the status of these wires from FIXED/COVER to ROUTED.   "\fB-honorFixedStatus {true|false}\fR" Does not allow preplaced, fixed instances to be resized.  Default: true  "\fB-honorPowerIntent {true|false}\fR" Performs MSV checks during ECO. When set to true:
.RS  "*" 2 ecoChangeCell does not allow:
.RS  "*" 2 Resizing a regular cell with an always-on cell (and vice-versa).  "*" 2 Resizing with cells belonging to different power domains.
.RE 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 ecoAddRepeater does not allow:
.RS  "*" 2 Adding buffer to a power domain it doesn't belong to.  "*" 2 Buffering a cross power domain net if it can cause MSV violations.  "*" 2 Adding a regular buffer to a net that requires an always-on buffer.  "*" 2 Adding an always-on buffer to a net that does not require an always-on buffer.
.RE 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 ecoDeleteRepeater does not allow deletion of a buffer or an inverter-pair that will cause:
.RS  "*" 2  A redundant isolation cell.  "*" 2  A CPF-constrained net to be deleted.
.RE 
.RE   Note:  To prevent buffer insertion failure due to MSV constraints, you need to set -honorPowerIntent to false.  Default: true  "\fB-inheritNetAttr {true | false}\fR" Inherits the net attribute.  Default: true  "\fB-LEQCheck {true|false}\fR" Enables functionality checking when swapping cells. The software can swap cells that are logically equivalent.  When -LEQCheck is true:
.RS  "*" 2 ecoAddRepeater adds inverter pair if the specified cell is inverter.  "*" 2 ecoDeleteRepeater deletes inverter pair if the specified instance is inverter.  "*" 2 ecoChangeCell changes cell to another cell type with the same function as long as they have same number of pins.
.RE   When -LEQCheck is set to false:
.RS  "*" 2 ecoAddRepeater can add only one single inverter if the specified cell is inverter.  "*" 2 ecoDeleteRepeater can delete only one single inverter if the specified instance is inverter.  "*" 2 ecoChangeCell can perform nonequivalent cell change as long as they have same number of pins.
.RE   Default: true  "\fB-modifyOnlyLayers <bottom_layer>:<top_layer>\fR" Modifies routes only on metal layers in this range (both inclusive).  Default:""  "\fB-prefixName <prefix>\fR" Adds a prefix to the inserted cells.  Default: ECO  Note: If the prefix name for eco cells is changed using the -prefixName option, it is not honored when the ECO batch mode is turned on.  "\fB-preserveModuleFunction {true|false}\fR" Determines whether to preserve logical functions at hierarchical module ports. It only works for manual ECO commands and overwrites the value of setOptMode -opt_preserve_hpin_function for the ECO commands, ecoAddRepeater, ecoChangeCell, and ecoDeleteRepeater.   Default: false  "\fB-refinePlace {true|false}\fR" Legalizes placement whenever ecoAddRepeater or ecoChangeCell are used. If false, you must run refinePlace after ECO if you want to legalize placement.  Note: Specifying -refinePlace true can affect performance when large numbers of cells are added or modified.  Default: true  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify reset by itself, the software resets all setEcoMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-spreadInverter {true|false}\fR" Distributes an inverter pair evenly between the driver and the sink. It works when the buffering nets have only one driver and one sink. The design must be routed before you use this parameter.  Default: true  "\fB-updateTiming {true|false}\fR" Controls whether to eco* commands recompute timing. If true, the eco* commands recompute timing. If false, the commands do not recompute timing, and us can later use report_timing to recompute timing.  Default: true
