.SH Name \fBdetailRoute\fR \-  Uses the NanoRoute router to perform detailed routing on the entire design, an area of the design specified by the bounding box, or on selected nets
.SH Syntax \fBdetailRoute\fR  [-help]  [-select]   [<area>] 
.P Uses the NanoRoute router to perform detailed routing on the entire design, an area of the design specified by the bounding box, or on selected nets. If you do not specify parameters, the router routes the entire design. If you specify both the bounding box and selected nets, the router routes only selected nets within the bounding box. You can perform detailed routing on specified area only if you are rerouting the design. If you have not already run detailed routing on the entire design, you cannot run detailed routing on a specified area.
.P Note: This command supports multiple-CPU processing. 
.P Use this command after completing the following steps:
.RS  "*" 2 Placing the design.  "*" 2 Routing special nets.  "*" 2 Setting net attributes with setAttribute and NanoRoute run-time options with setNanoRouteMode.   Note: This step is optional. Complete this step only if you do not want to use the current values for attributes or default values for options.   "*" 2 Running global routing with globalRoute.
