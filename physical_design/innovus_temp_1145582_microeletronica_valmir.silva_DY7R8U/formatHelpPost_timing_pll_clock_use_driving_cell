.SH Name \fBtiming_pll_clock_use_driving_cell\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_pll_clock_use_driving_cell\fR   {true | false}
.P Default : false
.P Uses delay calculation of all the enabled arcs to the PLL clock output to compute the transition.
.P When set to true, the delay calculation of all enabled arcs to the PLL clock output will be used to compute the transition. If no driving arcs are available in the model or if they are disabled, the same idealized transition will be used.
.P When set to false, the software considers the PLL clock output to be electrically isolated from the input-side reference clock, and creates the output clock with an idealized transition. You can use the set_annotated_transitionset_annotated_transition command to customize the output clock transition.  
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
