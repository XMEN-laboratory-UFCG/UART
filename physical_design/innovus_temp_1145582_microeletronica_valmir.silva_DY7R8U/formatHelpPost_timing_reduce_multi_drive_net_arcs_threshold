.SH Syntax \fBtiming_reduce_multi_drive_net_arcs_threshold\fR <int> 
.P Default: 10000
.P Sets a threshold number that is used to trigger the reduction of timing arcs of nets driven by parallel buffers. The reduction takes place if the number of arcs is greater than the threshold value and when the timing_reduce_multi_drive_net_arcs global variable is set to true.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
