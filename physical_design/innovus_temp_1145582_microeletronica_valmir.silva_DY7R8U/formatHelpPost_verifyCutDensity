.TH verifyCutDensity  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBverifyCutDensity\fR \-  Checks the density of specified cut layers or areas of cut layers, or the cut density of the whole chip
.SH Syntax \fBverifyCutDensity\fR  [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]   [-detailed]   [-globalDensity]   [-ignoreCellBlock]   [-layer <layer_name_list>]  [-oversize <value>]  [-report <fileName>]  
.P Checks the density of specified cut layers or areas of cut layers, or the cut density of the whole chip. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyCutDensity parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command: man verifyCutDensity.  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the area to verify. For example, verifyCutDensity -area {0 0 100 100}.  Default: Entire area  "\fB-detailed\fR" Generates a detailed cut density report.  "\fB-globalDensity\fR" Checks the density across the entire design for the specified cut layers and writes the results to the report file.  "\fB-ignoreCellBlock\fR" Disables checking of windows that are fully covered by block or pad obstructions.  "\fB-layer <layer_name_list>\fR" Specifies the cut layers to verify.  Use the following format to specify layer names:  {Via12 Via23}  For example, verifyCutDensity -layer {Via12 Via23}.  "\fB-oversize <value>\fR" Specifies an offset value for the area to verify. The value is in user units (not in DBU), and can be positive or negative. A positive value adds to the area that is verified. For example, if the design covers the area from (0,0) to (100,100) and you specify -oversize 10, verifyCutDensity checks the area from (-10,-10) to (110,110).  Default: 0  "\fB-report <fileName>\fR" Specifies the report file for the cut density violation information.  Default: <designName>.cutdensity.rpt 
.SH Example
.P The following command checks the density across the entire design for the layers Via12 and Via23 and generates a detailed report named density.rpt.   verifyCutDensity -layer {Via12 Via23} -report density.rpt -detailed -globalDensity
