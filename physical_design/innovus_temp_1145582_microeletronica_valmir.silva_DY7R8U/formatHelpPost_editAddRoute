.TH editAddRoute  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBeditAddRoute\fR \-  Creates a wire segment that starts or ends at the specified coordinates
.SH Syntax \fBeditAddRoute\fR  [-help]  <point>  
.P Creates a wire segment that starts or ends at the specified coordinates. Splits diagonal wires whose width is greater than the LEF MAXWIDTH parameter for that layer as they are drawn.
.P If required, the tool allows you to change the net order while adding wire segments. Check the Examples sections for details.
.P Note: Before running any Wire Editor command, all objects and pre-routed wires/vias must be colorized already. 
.P If you do not want to view flight lines between Power and Ground (PG) wires and pins when drawing PG nets, use setLayerPreference flightLine -isVisible 0 to turn off the display of these flightlines. editAddRoute as well as editCommitRoute honor this setting. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editAddRoute parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man editAddRoute  "\fB<point>\fR" Specifies the x and y coordinates for the start point or end point of the wire segment.  Note that if the points you specify with each successive editAddRoute command are not aligned vertically or horizontally, the tool adjusts the coordinates to align the end point of one segment with the start point of the next segment. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands create wire segments that start and stop at the specified points. The complete wire ends at the point specified by editCommitRoute.   editAddRoute 33.392 36.831    #Start of first wire segment  editAddRoute 32.985 32.766    #End of first wire segment, start of second  editAddRoute 18.064 32.115    #End of second wire segment  editAddRoute 20.951 27.073    #End of third wire segment  editCommitRoute 20.992 27.114 #End of wire  "*" 2 Use the following set of commands to add wire segments with different orders of nets:  uiSetTool addWire  setEditMode -layer_horizontal M10  setEditMode -nets { a b c d e f}  setEditMode -wire_override_spec {{1 0.062 0.128} {2 0.062 0.1900} {3 0.062 0.128} {4 0.062 0.1900} {5 0.062 0.128} {6 0.062 0.1900} }  editAddRoute {1000 2500}  editAddRoute {1100 2500}  setEditMode -layer_vertical M9  #Change Net Order  setEditMode -nets { a c b d f e}  setEditMode -wire_override_spec {{1 0.082 0.228} {2 0.082 0.2900} {3 0.082 0.228} {4 0.082 0.6680} {5 0.082 0.228} {6 0.082 0.2900} }  editAddRoute {1100 2600}  editCommitRoute {1100 2600}
