.TH timing_sdf_adjust_negative_setuphold  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_sdf_adjust_negative_setuphold\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_sdf_adjust_negative_setuphold\fR   {true | false}
.P Default: false
.P Controls how the setup and hold check values are adjusted when both are initially negative in the SDF file.
.P When set to true, the software sets the smaller check delay value to a negated larger check delay value. For example, if the initial setup/hold value is equal to -1/-2. then the value -2 from the setup is smaller and it is reset to a negated value of the larger one (-1 from hold). So the adjusted setup/hold value is equal to -1/1.
.P When set to false, both the negative setup and hold check values are set to 0.
.P The command order for using this global variable is as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 read_sdf  "*" 2 timing_sdf_adjust_negative_setuphold {true | false}  "*" 2 write_sdf
.RE
.P The timing report (report_timing) results are not impacted.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
