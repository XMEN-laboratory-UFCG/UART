.SH Name \fBloadLefFile\fR \-  Imports all the technology and library data that is specified in the LEF files into the Innovus environment
.SH Syntax \fBloadLefFile\fR  [<file1 file2
...>]< >  [-help]   [-areaIo]  [-blackbox]   [-incremental] 
.P Imports all the technology and library data that is specified in the LEF files into the Innovus environment. In addition, this command provides the location of the LEF files the routers need to access.
.P You can use the loadLefFile command at any time.    Note: The loadLefFile command checks your LEF file to make sure that layers are defined in the correct order (as described in the LEF/DEF Language Reference.) For example, routing layers must be defined alternately with cut layers:
.P LAYER METAL1  TYPE ROUTING 
...  END METAL1
.P LAYER VIA12  TYPE CUT 
...  END VIA12
.P LAYER METAL2  TYPE ROUTING 
...  END METAL2  If you do not define layers in the correct order (for example, if you define all routing layers before cut layers, the Innovus software displays an error message. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each parameter of the loadLefFile command.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man loadLefFile.  "\fB-areaIo\fR" Treats the pad macro cell as an areaIo cell. This option is used for versions of LEF prior to 5.5.  "\fB-blackbox\fR" Treats the block macro cell as a blackbox. This option is used for versions of LEF prior to 5.5.  "\fB<file1 file2
...>\fR" Specify the names of LEF files to be loaded.  "\fB-incremental\fR" Appends the antenna data into existing layers and macro cells. This is only used for appending LEF 5.4 antenna data.
