.SH Name \fBanalyze_esd_voltage\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBanalyze_esd_voltage\fR  [-help]  -current_distribution_layer <layer>  -driver_receiver_file <filename>  -esd_pin_location_file <filename>  [-maximum_violations <value>]  -net<NetName>  [-report <filename>]  [-threshold <value>]   -total_current <value>  [-detailed_report {true | false}] 
.P Performs IR Drop analysis for every driver/receiver pair and reports voltage drop above the given limit. Use this command to provide the current injection points (sinks), the current distribution layer (source), and the total ESD current to be distributed. The command generates a report containing all the violations where potential difference across driver/receiver is greater than the given threshold.
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.  "\fB-current_distribution_layer <layer>\fR" Specifies to distribute current to all nodes of the given layer. This is the LEF/DEF layer name. This is a required parameter.   "\fB-detailed_report {true | false}\fR" Specifies to report the differential voltage for each zap point above the specified threshold. It gives the x,y location of the zap point and the zap point name. Using this parameter, you can fix all the differential voltage violations in a single run.
.P This parameter will generate the report file with the same name as specified using the -report parameter and with the _detail.rpt suffix.   Default : false  The following is an example of the parameter:  analyze_esd_voltage  -net VSS -driver_receiver_file
./driverdb_railVSS   -esd_pin_location_file VSS.pp -current_distribution_layer METAL5  -total_current 8 -report FULL_new_gnd_esd_cdm.rpt -detailed_report true -threshold 2  "\fB-driver_receiver_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the driver/receiver file of the net. This file is created by the -create_driver_db parameter of the set_power_analysis_mode. This is a required parameter.  The file has multiple columns, wherein the first column is the receiver, and the remaining columns are drivers to the receiver instance. The following is an example of the file content:  padring/I_RCV_7 io_toplevel/padring/I_DECAP io_toplevel/padring/  In this example:  padring/I_RCV_7 is the receiver instance.  io_toplevel/padring/I_DECAP and io_toplevel/padring/ are driver instances.  "\fB-esd_pin_location_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the ESD pin location file. This is a required parameter.  The format of the file is:  #Pin_name    x coord    y coord    layer  gnd_pin_1      2284.6    -2898.05   m4 
... 
...  "\fB-maximum_violations <value>\fR" Specifies the number of max worst violations to be reported. This is an optional parameter.  When this value is specified, only the specified number of top violations will be reported. If a value is not specified, voltage drop for all driver/receiver pairs will be reported.  "\fB-net<NetName>\fR" Specifies the name of the net to be analyzed. This is a required parameter.  "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the output report file in which details of the driver-receiver violation pair is written. This is an optional parameter. The report is filtered in descending order of differential voltage.  The output file has four columns:
.RS  "*" 2 First column - Differential voltage(V)  "*" 2 Second column - Driver name (node location(um) )  "*" 2 Third column - Receiver name (node location(um))  "*" 2 Fourth column - ESD pin name (location(nm))
.RE   The following is the sample ESD file format:  14.1324    pmc/a_ip_pmc_chassis_c55fg ( 2050.875 -2760.085 ap )   io_toplevel/padring/I_ESDCLAMP_39 ( 1428.200 2884.250 m4 )gnd_pin_22 ( 1458.200 2898.050 m4 )  "\fB-threshold <value>\fR" Specifies the minimum allowed driver/receiver voltage for filtering the report. This is an optional parameter.  When a threshold value is specified, driver/receiver pairs with differential voltage greater than the specified threshold value will be reported. If a threshold value is not specified, voltage drop for all driver/receiver pairs will be reported.  "\fB-total_current <value>\fR" Specifies the total ESD current to be distributed. The default current unit is amperes. This is a required parameter. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following example performs static IR Drop analysis to check the voltage drop between all driver and receiver pairs:  analyze_esd_voltage  -net gnd -driver_receiver_file
./POWER/driverdb_railgnd   -esd_pin_location_file
./epinfile -current_distribution_layer m1  -total_current 8 -report FULL_new_gnd_esd_cdm.rpt
