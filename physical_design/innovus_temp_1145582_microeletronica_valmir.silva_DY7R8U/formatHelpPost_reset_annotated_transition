.TH reset_annotated_transition  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreset_annotated_transition\fR \-  Resets annotated transitions previously asserted by the set_annotated_transition command
.SH Syntax  \fBreset_annotated_transition\fR  {-all | <port_or_pin_list>} 
.P Resets annotated transitions previously asserted by the set_annotated_transition command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-all\fR" Resets all annotated transitions in the design.  "\fB<port_or_pin_list>\fR" Specifies a list of specific pins or primary ports to reset the transition. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands reset the set_annotated_transition constraint on an internal pin pad/Y0.   reset_annotated_transition pad/Y0  or  reset_annotated_transition [get_pins {pad/Y0}]  You can also specify a collection as the pin argument. For example:  reset_annotated_transition [get_pins pad/*]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands reset the set_annotated_transition constraint set on a port in:   reset_annotated_transition in  or  reset_annotated_transition [get_ports {in}]  Any set_input_transition constraint applied on the same port is not removed. This is applicable only for input ports, as set_input_transition cannot be applied on output ports.
.RE
