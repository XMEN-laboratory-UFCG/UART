.P Creates power-grid view (xPGV) models for large digital blocks.The block xPGV can be generated either after the signoff dynamic IR drop analysis or after the dynamic Early Rail Analysis (ERA) of the block. In both cases, the xPGV is generated using the R-C grid of the block and currents captured at the via layer during the analysis. These block-level xPGVs can then be instantiated during the next level of the design or the top-level full-chip analysis. The next level rail analysis will run faster with the block-level xPGVs because these runs use the power-grid that is modeled inside the xPGV.

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage.   "\fB-cell <cell_name>  \fR" Specifies the block name for which xPGV model is generated.  "\fB-inst_list <inst1> inst2
.. <instn>\fR" Specifies the block instances for which xPGV model is generated.   "\fB-libgen_include <file_name>  \fR" Specifies a file that includes additional library generation options that will be run for xPGV model generation.  "\fB-mvmf_config <config_file>\fR" Specifies to generate a single xPGV model with different functional modes. Using this parameter, you can specify a file that includes the different modes and the mapping state directory for each mode. When -mvmf_config is specified, the block-level currents are saved for multiple voltages and frequency (MvMf) per each functional mode in a single PGV.  During xPGV instantiation, the different modes are automatically selected based on the power domain to which each mode is connected.  The format of the <config_file> file is:  <<modeName1>>  <<stateDir_1>>  <<modeName2>>  <<stateDir_2>>  
...  <<modeNameN>>  <<stateDir_N>>  Before generating MvMf-xPGV, you need to perform multiple rail analysis runs for different corners to generate different state directories (stateDir_*) to be included in the configuration file.  "\fB-output_dir <directory_name>  \fR" Specifies the name of the output directory in which the power-grid library report is created. The default is the current working directory.  "\fB-rail_include <file_name>\fR" Specifies a file that includes additional rail analysis options that will be run for xPGV model generation.  "\fB-reuse_block_state_directory <directory_name>\fR" Specifies an existing rail analysis state directory to skip block extraction. The software assumes that the design data (DEFs and GDS) and power-grid libraries are not changed, and will generate xPGV using the extraction data inside the specified state directory. If the state directory does not contain the necessary design and power-grid database files, it will issue an error message and provide information on the missing files.  The -reuse_block_state_directory parameter is used if the entire design that is analyzed in the rail run should be used to create the xPGV. However, this parameter must not be used in case you require to generate xPGVs for each instance (sub-blocks) of a block. That is, for generating xPGVs for the sub-blocks B and C of the block A (rail analysis was performed on block A), you need to re-extract the block-level grids of B and C as part of xPGV generation for accurate current calculation. In this case, -reuse_block_state_directory must not be specified.  For net based analysis, you should specify net-based state directory, as shown below:
.RS  "*" 2 generate_xpgv -reuse_block_state_directory<VDD_25C_avg_1>
.RE   For domain based analysis, you should specify the domain's state directory, as shown below:
.RS  "*" 2 generate_xpgv -reuse_block_state_directory<domain_25C_dynamic_1>
.RE   A new state directory will be generated for the new analysis with soft links to the old state directory files that were reused.  "\fB-state_directory <directory_name>\fR" Specifies the path to the rail analysis state directory. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command creates an xPGV library hier_block.cl:   generate_xpgv -state_directory dynamic_rail/core_125C_dynamic_1/ -cell hier_block -output_dir
../xpgv/  "*" 2 The following command creates an xPGV library super_filter_A with multiple functional modes specified in the mode.config file:   generate_xpgv -cell super_filter_A -mvmf_config mode.config -output_dir
./mode_mvmf -rail_include rail.inc  The following is a snippet from the mode.config file:  label1 dynamic_rail/core_25C_dynamic_1  lable2 dynamic_rail/core_25C_dynamic_1
