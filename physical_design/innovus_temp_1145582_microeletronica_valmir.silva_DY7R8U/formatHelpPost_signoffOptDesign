.SH Name \fBsignoffOptDesign\fR \-  Runs timing, area, DRV, dynamic or leakage optimization on signoff timing
.SH Syntax \fBsignoffOptDesign\fR  [-help]  [-all]  [-area]   [-drv]  [-dynamic]  [-hold]   [-leakage]  [-noEcoRoute]  [-outDir <dir_name>]  [-reportFullClockPath]  [-power]  [-prefix <prefix_name>]  [-setup] 
.P Runs timing, area, DRV, dynamic or leakage optimization on signoff timing.
.P This command must be run on a design that has gone through the implementation flow. It allows you to fix timing violations or to improve area and power visible in signoff STA mode while staying in the implementation tool. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each signoffOptDesign parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man signoffOptDesign  "\fB-all\fR" Performs DRV, Setup, Hold, and Power optimization in the path-based analysis (PBA) mode. It also includes embedded calls to ecoRoute, parasitic extraction and signoff timing analysis.  Note:The all-in-one mode does not replace all customized fine-tuned flows. It provides the Innovus users easy access to Tempus ECO technology. The existing Tempus ECO flow using individual optimization steps within Innovus is still supported and can sometimes be more efficient than the all-in-one mode.  "\fB-area\fR" Reclaims area on the netlist without causing any DRV/Setup/Hold degradation.   "\fB-drv\fR" Optimizes DRV (maximum capacitance and maximum transition) violations. DRV optimization supports buffer addition and resizing.   "\fB-dynamic\fR" Prints initial and final power numbers. It optimizes the dynamic power to reduce the total power consumption. Dynamic power optimization supports buffer deletion ,resizing, and swapping.  "\fB-hold\fR" Triggers hold fixing in signoff timing mode.   "\fB-leakage\fR" Optimizes leakage power. Leakage optimization supports VT swapping.   "\fB-noEcoRoute\fR" Allows signoffOptDesign command to skip ECO routing and final signoff STA.   "\fB-outDir <dir_name>\fR" Specifies the directory in which the reports will be saved.  Note: In case signoffOptDesign is reusing ECO timing DB generated earlier by signoffTimeDesign or when the -noEcoRoute parameter is applied, no timing reports are saved.  "\fB-power\fR" Optimizes total power in the design. During total power optimization, the software performs swapping and sizing on both the combinational and the sequential cells, and also removes buffers. This reduces leakage, internal, and switching power in the design.   "\fB-prefix <prefix_name>\fR" Specifies the prefix for the timing report file names.   "\fB-reportFullClockPath\fR" When this parameter is specified, the detailed timing report that is generated contains the full clock path.  "\fB-setup\fR" Optimizes setup timing violations. Setup optimization supports buffer addition, VT swapping and resizing. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following commands to perform setup optimization followed by a leakage power optimization. The setup optimization is with no -ecoRoute, while the leakage power optimization calls the -ecoRoute along with final signoff STA results.  signoffOptDesign -setup -noEcoRoute  signoffOptDesign -leakage   "*" 2 Use the following commands to perform an area reclaim optimization that is based on external spef files:  spefIn -rc_corner rc_max rc_max.spef.gz  spefIn -rc_corner rc_min rc_min.spef.gz  signoffTimeDesign -reportOnly  signoffOptDesign -area   "*" 2 Use the following command to dump out the final STA results in a folder named "RPT". The timing report files inside the "RPT" folder will be named "SIGNOFF_ECO_*".  signoffOptDesign -hold -outDir RPT -prefix SIGNOFF_ECO  "*" 2 Use the following set of commands to reclaim total power in the design:  report_power   setSignoffOptMode -deleteInst true -optimizeSequentialCells true  signoffOptDesign -power   "*" 2 Use the following set of commands to perform DRV, Setup, Hold, and Power optimization in the PBA mode:  setMultiCpuUsage -localCpu 16 -remoteHost 4 -cpuPerRemoteHost 4  setSignoffOptMode -allowSkewing true -clockCellList {.....}  signoffOptDesign -all  Innovus will run Tempus ECO for PBA-based DRV, timing and power closure. The Setup fixing will be done using useful skew technology. Signoff timing analysis will use 4 remote hosts each using 4 CPUs while ECO fixing, ECO routing, and parasitic extraction will use 16 CPUs.
