.SH Name \fBcreate_ccopt_generated_clock_tree\fR \-  Defines a generated clock tree within the design. Use this command if you want to balance the sinks in the generated tree against those in the parent trees
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_ccopt_generated_clock_tree\fR  [-help]  [-generated_by pins]  [-name <clockname>]  [-parents <parents>]  [-search_method <method>]  -source <pin>  [-stop_at_sdc_clock_roots] 
.P Defines a generated clock tree within the design. Use this command if you want to balance the sinks in the generated tree against those in the parent trees. CCOpt accomplishes this action by pulling up any sinks in the parent trees that contribute directly to the generated clock tree. The insertion delay under such sinks in the parent trees will be set to the insertion delay of the generated clock tree plus the delay between the sink pin and the source of the generated clock tree. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_ccopt_generated_clock_tree parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man create_ccopt_generated_clock_tree.  "\fB-generated_by <pins>   \fR" Specifies the sink pins in the parent clock trees for which the delay between the parent and generated clock trees should be considered.   If this parameter is not specified, all possible timing paths between sinks in the parent tree and the source of the generated clock tree will be considered.  This parameter is mutually exclusive with the -search_method parameter.  "\fB-name <clockname>\fR" Specifies the user-defined identifier for the generated clock tree. This name should be unique. If this parameter is not specified, the software uses the name of the source pin by default.  "\fB-parents <parents>                    \fR" Specifies the parent clock trees for the generated clock trees. This parameter should be specified if the parents are ambiguous.  "\fB-search_method {same_instance multi_stage}\fR" Specifies the search methdology to be used when tracing the path to the generator inputs.  multi_stage  This is the default method, and will select the current behavior of the software. When this method is specified, the software searches backwards through all the delay paths leading into the clock root pin, looking for pre-existing clock sinks. Every such clock sink found is a candidate generator input for the generated clock tree. This includes clock sinks that lie on different instances to the root pin - where multiple stages lie between the clock sink and the root pin. Additional filtering on the candidate generator inputs is applied by the -parents parameter  to avoid producing cycles in the clock tree structure. Once the set of generator inputs is finalized, the delay path between each finalized generator input and the clock root pin is imported into the CCOpt clock tree data stuctures. If the generator input lies on a different instance of the clock root pin,  ClockGeneratorPathNode objects are created.  same_instance  This method is similar to the multi_stage method, except that the software restricts its search to consider only clock sinks that lie on the same instance as the generated clock tree's root pin. This means that the software does not traverse net arcs looking for generator input clock sinks. Consequently, ClockGeneratorPathNode objects will not be needed to model any generator path.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This functionally is identical to specifying the -generated_by parameter that lists all the clock sinks on the same instance as the clock root pin. However, it avoids the need to explicitly identify those clock sinks.  "*" 2 Irrespective of the search method, if no candidate generator clock sink is found, or if there are no valid generator inputs discovered in the set of clock sinks, creation of the generated clock tree fails with an error.
.RE   The software uses  multi_stage method by default.  This parameter is mutually exclusive with the -generated_by parameter.  "\fB-source <pin>  \fR" Specifies the name of the source pin of the generated clock tree. This is a required parameter.   "\fB-stop_at_sdc_clock_roots\fR" Specifies that clock tree definition should stop searching for parts of the clock tree through the root of the SDC clocks. 
.SH Example 
.RS  "*" 2  The following command defines a generated clock tree clk_div_2, which is generated from the gen_clk/CK clock pin, using the gen_clk.QN pin as the source pin:  create_ccopt_generated_clock_tree -name clk_div_2 -source gen_clk/QN -generated_by gen_clk/CK
