.P Use this command after creating at least one operating condition (create_op_cond). 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-library_file\fR" Specifies the library file in which the operating condition is defined.  "\fB-P\fR" Returns the process value for the operating condition.  "\fB-T\fR" Returns the temperature value for the operating condition.  "\fB-V\fR" Returns the voltage value for the operating condition.  "\fB<virtualOpcondName>\fR" Specifies the name of the operating condition to query 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates an operating condition called myPVT2 for the library IsCOM-2V.lib:   create_op_cond -name myPVT2     -library_file IsCOM-2V.lib     -P 1.0      -V 1.2      -T 20
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a collection called myPVT2-temp that contains the temperature value of the myPVT2 operating condition:   set myPVT2-temp [get_op_cond myPVT2 -T]
