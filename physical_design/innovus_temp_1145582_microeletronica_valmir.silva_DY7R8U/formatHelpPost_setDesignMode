.P Specifies the process technology value. You can use this command to change the process technology dependent default settings globally for each application instead of setting several mode options.
.P With advanced technologies and new design, manufacturing techniques accurate delay calculation becomes more challenging. The main challenges are:
.RS  "*" 2 Delay and slew interpretation of distorted waveforms.  "*" 2 Waveforms are affected by:
.RS  "*" 2 Distributed RC  "*" 2 Back-miller current  "*" 2 Crosstalk and input noise  "*" 2 Different non-linear characteristics of gates
.RE  "*" 2 Ultra low voltage applications

.P Tempus STA for advanced nodes has several capabilities for signoff timing accuracy at the respective nodes. The setDesignMode command automatically enables the node specific signoff STA setting required to meet the signoff STA accuracy challenges at the specific nodes.
.P Use the getDesignMode command to return the current settings for the setDesignMode command.
.P When you specify a process technology value using the setDesignMode command, the Innovus software assigns coupling capacitance threshold values to the RC extraction filters automatically. These values determine whether the coupling capacitances of the nets in a design will be lumped to the ground.
.P Note: In TQuantus extraction, the grounding of coupling capacitances also depends on the capacitance filtering mode set by the -capFilterMode parameter of the setExtractRCMode command.
.P The following table lists the coupling capacitance threshold values that are applied based on the specified process node. Note that the table might not be readable when viewed with the Unix man command. Check the setDesignMode command description in the Innovus Text Command Reference to view the table.  ________________________________________________________

.P Note: The filtering values set by the Innovus software, which are based on the process node setting, attempt to capture the most significant effect of coupling capacitances on SI analysis, and are strongly recommended. However, you can choose to specify different filtering thresholds using the -coupling_c_th, -relative_c_th, and -total_c_th parameters of the setExtractRCMode command.
.P In addition to the extraction filters, the software selects the extraction engine based on the process node. For 65nm and below process nodes, the software uses the TQuantus extraction engine, which provides scaling factors closer to 1 with better correlation to sign-off extraction. It also provides coupling capacitances to the wires on the layers above and below the victim wire. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setDesignMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setDesignMode  "\fB-backsideBottomRoutingLayer <layer>\fR" Specifies the highest backside LEF layer name for global and detail routing.  Default: ""  "\fB-backsideTopRoutingLayer <layer>\fR" Specifies the lowest backside LEF layer name for global and detail routing.  Default: ""  "\fB-bottomRoutingLayer <layer>\fR" Specifies the lowest lef layer name for global and detail routing.  For a special partial routing on the first routing layer in certain nodes, the routing enablement of that layer must be a global decision in the entire flow of the design. For example, if M0 or M1 routing is enabled, you need to set setDesignMode -bottomRoutingLayer M0/1 from the init step. This bottom routing layer setting must not be changed in later stages of the flow.  Default: ""  "\fB-compressedPGDB {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether the compressed PG feature is enabled. When it is set to true, restoreDesign will automatically compress the PG data while loading the design. You can use "dbGet top.isPGCompressed" to check if PG in the design is compressed.  Default: false  "\fB-congEffort {low|medium|high|auto}\fR" Specifies the congestion effort level. It controls placement as well the place_opt_design behavior.   It is also possible to have other tuning for other steps in the flow.  Default: auto  Specify one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 auto: Automatically determines whether the design is congested and performs extra congestion driven effort for highly congested designs.   "*" 2 high: Runs more iterations of placement in an effort to achieve better congestion results. This parameter increases the run time. This also does congestion-aware buffering.   When -congEffort is set to high, optDesign takes actions to be more congestion friendly and may call more iterations of placement to achieve better congestion results. It will also implicitly set setPlaceMode -congEffort high you have not set setPlaceMode -conEffort. However, if you have set setPlaceMode -congEffort, it will not override your setting. That is, the setting of "setPlaceMode -congEffort" will be honored.  If you set both setDesignMode -congEffort and setPlaceMode -congEffort, the placeDesign and incremental placement will take your setting of setPlaceMode -congEffort. However for the flow, optDesign will take whatever tuning you have done for the -congEffort level.  "*" 2 low: Runs fewer iterations of placement to arrive quickly at a legal placement. This parameter might decrease placement quality.   "*" 2 medium: Runs placement on designs at a normal effort level.
.RE   "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setDesignMode parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-addPhysicalCell {hier | flat}\fR" Adds support for physical cells such as Add Filler, Add Well Tap, Add End Cap in a hierarchy that exists at the location of each of the newly added cells.  Default: hier  "\fB-dual_rail_via_pitch <min_via_pitch> <min_filler_via_pitch> <cell_boundary_spacing>\fR" This option is used when two horizontal power-rails on the first and third routing layer are used for standard-cells, and the min-spacing of stacked-vias between the dual-rails is controlled during placement and routing.
.RS  "*" 2 min_via_pitch: It is the minimum center-to-center pitch of the stacked-vias touching any active standard-cell (not a filler cell).
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 min_filler_via_pitch: It is the minimum center-to-center pitch of the stacked-vias touching only filler cells.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 cell_boundary_spacing: Specifies how close a PIN or OBS shape must be to the cell boundary to block a stacked-via in the power rail at that point.
.RE   The placer makes sure that there is room for a stacked-via as required, the global routers estimate the congestion cost before the stacked-vias are created, and the power-router adds them during the followpin routing as required.  "\fB-earlyClockFlow {true|false}\fR" Enables the early clock flow inside place_opt_design.  For the early clock flow inside place_opt_design, CCOpt creates a clock tree based on the initial clustering and annotates clock latencies for timing optimization. The flow also enables CCOpt ideal mode useful skew during the WNS/TNS fixing step inside place_opt_design. CCOpt skewing can be turned off by using setOptMode -opt_skew_pre_cts false.  Default: false  "\fB-expressRoute {true|false}\fR" Specifies to force routing-stage with the express flow, that is -flowEffort express.   "\fB-flowEffort {express|standard|extreme}\fR" Guides the effort of every super-command.
.RS  "*" 2 express: Configures the flow to give the best turnaround time with good WNS/area correlation as compared to the standard flow. The flow is appropriate for prototyping.  "*" 2 standard: Configures the flow to give the best overall combination of quality of results and full-flow turnaround time. This flow is appropriate for the majority of designs.  "*" 2 extreme: Configures the flow to give the best quality of results at some cost in turnaround time. This flow is appropriate for designs where timing closure is challenging. 
.RE   Default: standard  Note: The individual parameters of set*Mode commands have higher priority over the setDesignMode -flowEffort parameter.  "\fB-ignore_followpin_vias {true|false}\fR" This option directs the detailed placer, optimization, and signal routing to ignore any sViaInst (special-route vias) with the followpin shape. You can use this option if the two bottom routing layers both have a horizontal routing direction, and you use dual power-rails on those two layers on top of each other for the standard-cell power rails.  In this usage, other commands and options will add as many sViaInsts as possible between the power-rails, and remove any sViaInsts that cause spacing violations between the sViaInst cut shapes and any cell or signal routing cut shapes. This gives the placer and router more freedom to get higher density, run faster, but still put as many sViaInsts as possible between the dual power-rails.  When set to true, followpin vias are ignored during detailed placement, optimization, and routing.  Default: false  "\fB-merge_trim_shapes {{layers <layer_name_list> gap <gap_value> max_merge_num <number_of_max_merge> masks {<mask_num>
...}}
...}\fR" Specifies the setting for trim shapes merge. 
.RS  "*" 2 layers: You use this t specify the trim layer list which needs to merge trim shapes.   "*" 2 Gap: You use this setting when the end to end gap is less the value.  "*" 2 max_merge_num:  You use this to specify the max trim shapes number that are merged.  "*" 2 masks: You use this to specify the trim shapes color that needs to be merged.
.RE   Default: ""  "\fB-node {N22|N12|N10|N7|N7Plus|N6|N5|N5PlusPlus|N4|N3|N3E|N2|S11|S10|S8|S7|S5|S4|S3|S2|G7|G5|ICF|I7|I5|P1277|P1278|P1280|C12|C7|unspecified}\fR" Sets the design technology node.  Default: unspecified  "\fB-pessimisticMode {true|false}\fR" Specifies that delay calculation pessimistic mode should be used in Innovus during implementation. This mode adjusts delay calculation settings to maintain a degree of pessimism during implementation to help limit optimistic outliers during external timing signoff.  Note: The pessimistic mode must not be used in Innovus if Tempus is the final signoff timing engine.  Default: false  "\fB-powerEffort {none|low|high}\fR" Specifies the effort to reduce the dynamic and leakage power. The tradeoff between dynamic and leakage power can also be controlled. 
.RS  "*" 2 none: No power optimization is performed and power is not considered during timing optimization.  "*" 2 low: Power is considered during timing optimization and power optimization is performed in all flow stages.  "*" 2 high: Additional algorithms are used to minimize power consumption. Turnaround time with this option will be longer than using low or none.
.RE   Default: none  "\fB-process <integer>\fR" Specifies the process technology value to set for all the applications. Units in nanometers (nm).  The setDesignMode -node and -process options to assign a tech node (such as N7) and a process number (such as 7) for the design. Innovus tools (placement, routing, etc) then use both the tech node and the process number to differentiate the designs and provide specific functions. It is important for the design to have a correct node and process information for the Innovus tools to work properly.  Type: Integer  Range: 2-250  Note: The process 2 is under the beta control. Contact your Cadence representative for more information related to this command.  Default: 90  "\fB-slackWeighting {unityWeighting|viewBasedWeighting}\fR" Specifies slack weighting to be used in the implementation flow.  Default: unityWeighting  "\fB-topRoutingLayer <layer>\fR" Specifies the highest lef layer name for global and detail routing.  Default: ""  "\fB-trim_grid_group <group_name>\fR" Specifies the GROUP name of the set from which the trim metal grid will be used for placement and routing.  Default: ""  If the specified group name does not exist in LEF, the tool will return an ERROR.  See the LEF documentation on the TRIMMETALTRACK keyword for more details.
