.SH Name \fBsynthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees\fR \-  This command is used to synthesize all flexible H-trees that have been created but not previously synthesized, in one go
.SH Syntax \fBsynthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees\fR  [-help]  [-block_master_clone]  [-dry_run]  [-spec_file <fileName>]   [-use_estimated_routes | -trial_mode {true | false | placement_only | routing_only}] 
.P This command is used to synthesize all flexible H-trees that have been created but not previously synthesized, in one go. The flexible H-trees are created using the create_ccopt_flexible_htree command. The synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees command helps reduce the runtime by synthesizing all flexible H-trees in one go as compared to if the flexible H-trees were synthesized one at a time. This is because when you use this command, nanoRoute is called only once to route all flexible H-trees at the same time. 
.P Note: You must run the synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees command to synthesize any flexible H-trees previously created using the create_ccopt_flexible_htree command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help          \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees.   "\fB-block_master_clone\fR" When specified, blocks master/clone partitions for H-tree instances and nets.  If this parameter is not specified, and the master/clone partitions do not contain H-tree sink pins, then the software will error out with the following error:  **ERROR: (IMPCCOPT-1506): Flexible H-tree 'htree' uses a sink grid, which is not supported on master/clone designs unless master/clone partitions are blocked during flexible H-tree synthesis. If applicable, master/clone partitions can be blocked using synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees -block_master_clone.  "\fB-dry_run\fR" Runs the synthesis algorithm but do not insert the H-tree into the database.   "\fB-spec_file <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the clock tree specification script file. When the file name is specified, the clock tree specification file is not amended to reflect the new state of the clock tree. Instead, the amendments, which are in the form of Tcl commands, are written to the file specified using this parameter.   "\fB-trial_mode {true | false | placement_only | routing_only}\fR" When set, enables trial routing and placement mode for flexible H-tree synthesis. The following settings are available:  true: Run routing and detailed placement in trial mode.  false: Run neither routing nor detailed placement in trial mode. THis si the default setting.  placement_only: Only run detailed placement in trial mode.  routing_only : Only run routing in trial mode.  Note: The -trial_mode and -use_estimated_routes parameters are mutually exclusive.  Default: false  "\fB-use_estimated_routes\fR" Specifies that NanoRoute should not be called. So, the routing estimates are left in the netlist.  Note: The -trial_mode and -use_estimated_routes parameters are mutually exclusive. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following set of commands are used to a flexible H-tree under the pins "rootC/Y". The sinks will be of the type INVX9 and will be placed in the specified sink grid. Other buffers added to the H-tree will be of type INVX13. The flexible H-tree is then synthesized using the synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees command.
