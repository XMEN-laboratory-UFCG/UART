.TH create_clock  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreate_clock\fR \-  Creates a clock object and defines its waveform in the current design
.SH Syntax  \fBcreate_clock\fR  -period <period_value>  [-name <clock_name>]   [-waveform <edge_list>]   [-add]   [-comment <string>]  [<sources>] 
.P Creates a clock object and defines its waveform in the current design. If you do not specify any sources, but you specify the -name <clock_name> argument, a virtual clock is created. The new clock has an ideal clock latency, and the software does not assume any propagation delay through the clock network.
.P The clock that you create using the create_clock command cannot have multiple pulses per period. You can specify multiple constraints on the same pin using the -add parameter.
.P If one of the sources is already the source of a clock, the source is removed from that clock. If you need to specify multiple clocks on the same source for simultaneous analysis, you must specify the -add parameter, to add this clock to the existing clock.
.P For example, if you specify the following command sequence, the PH2 clock waveform overwrites the PH1 waveform.:
.P create_clock -name PH1
... [get_ports sysclk]   create_clock -name PH2
... [get_ports sysclk] 
.P To have both clocks applied, you must specify the following command sequence:
.P create_clock -name PH1
... [get_ports sysclk]   create_clock -name PH2 -add
... [get_ports sysclk] 
.P You can create a collection of clocks, which is a group of objects referenced by a string identifier using the get_clocks command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-add\fR" Specifies multiple clocks on the same source for simultaneous analysis with different clock waveforms. You must specify the -name parameter with this parameter.  "\fB-comment <string>\fR" Allows you to insert comments. The comments are read but are ignored with a one-time warning message. They are not used during timing analysis reporting nor are they written out during saving of constraints.  "\fB-name <clock_name>\fR" Specifies the string name of the ideal clock being created. If you do not specify this option, the clock gets the same name as the first clock source that you specify using the -sources option. If you do not specify any sources, you must specify the -name <clock_name> option, which creates a virtual clock not associated with a port or pin.  "\fB-period <period_value>\fR" Specifies the value of the ideal clock in library time units.  "\fB<sources>\fR" Specifies the list of pins or ports associated with an ideal clock waveform of the clock. If you do not specify this option, you must specify the -name <clock_name> option, which creates a virtual clock not associated with a port or pin. If you specify a clock on a pin that already has a clock, the new clock replaces the old one.  "\fB-waveform <edge_list>\fR" Specifies the rise and fall edge times of the clock waveforms in library time units over an entire clock period. The first value in the edge list is the time at which the first transition on the clock occurs, which is the first rising transition after time zero, and edges are monotonically increasing. The numbers should represent one full clock period. If you do not specify the -waveform <edge_list> option, a default waveform is assumed, and the leading edge is placed at 0 and the trailing edge is placed at the midpoint of the period, such that a symmetric clock is generated. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates an ideal_clk1 clock on port clkA with a period of 5, a rise at 0, and a fall at 2.5: create_clock [get_ports {clkA}] -name ideal_clk1 -period 5 -waveform {0 2.5}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates an ideal_clk2 clock on port clkB with a period of 10, a rise at 1, and a fall at 9: create_clock [get_ports {clkB}] -name ideal_clk2 -period 10 -waveform {1 9}
