.SH Name \fBtiming_disable_genclk_combinational_blocking\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_disable_genclk_combinational_blocking\fR  {true | false}
.P Default: false
.P Disables blocking of the latency path for a generated clock.
.P When set to true, allows the latency path to traverse through the upstream generated clock.
.P When set to false, if two back-to-back generated clocks are on the same path, and if the downstream generated clock is set using the create_generated_clock -combinational parameter, then the latency path for this generated clock is blocked by the upstream clock. The downstream generated clock is created with zero latency.
.P The software shows a warning if the source latency path to the upstream generated clock cannot be found. For example,
.P **WARN: (TA-1018): A source latency path to the generated clock GC2 through source pin clk1 to target pin GC2_1/Y in view default_emulate_view cannot be found. Timing analysis will use 0 ns source latency for the generated clock and will interpret the master clock based on the polarity at the master clock source pin.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
