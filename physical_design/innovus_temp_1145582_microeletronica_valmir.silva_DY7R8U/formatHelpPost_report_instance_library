.SH Name \fBreport_instance_library\fR \-  Reports library related information for an instance(s)
.SH Syntax  \fBreport_instance_library\fR  -file <fileName>  [-instance <instanceName>]   [-view <viewName> | -delay_corner <delayCornerName>]   [-power_domain <domainName>]   [-early | -late] 
.P Reports library related information for an instance(s). The report prints the following information about an instance:
.RS  "*" 2 Instance name
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Cell type
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 View name or delay corner
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Power domain name
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Library/Libset (early/late)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Library file (early/late)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2  Operating conditions  "*" 2  Binding Status : Prints out the status for the matched voltage library available. If the user setting is True, then the binding status is not displayed.
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-delay_corner <delayCornerName>\fR" Specifies the delay corner from which an instance library is to be selected. If no delay corner is specified, then all the instance libraries will be printed.  "\fB-early | -late\fR" Specifies the library set (early/late) from which a library instance is to be printed. If either of these options are not specified then both the early and late library sets are used.  "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file. If no file is specified, the report will be printed on standard output file.  "\fB-instance <instanceName>\fR" Specifies the instance(s) for which the report is to be printed. If no instance is provided the report will print information of all the instances. The value of instance can be a list of regular expressions.  "\fB-power_domain<domainName>\fR" Specifies the power domain from which instance(s) are to be selected. This option should be specified with the -delay_corner or -view options.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR"  Specifies the view from which instance library is to be selected.
