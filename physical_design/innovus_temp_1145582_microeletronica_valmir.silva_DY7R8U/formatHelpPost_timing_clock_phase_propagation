.SH Name \fBtiming_clock_phase_propagation\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_clock_phase_propagation\fR  {positive | negative | both} 
.P Default: both
.P Allows you to select the appropriate clock phases at register clock pins when both positive and negative phases of the same clock signal are seen in the clock network. For example, a register whose clock pin is fed by a two-input XOR gate where one input is a clock port and the other input is a data port. When the value of the data signal of the XOR gate is unknown, the XOR gate can see both positive and negative phases of the clock signal.    "\fBboth\fR" Selects both positive and negative clock phases at the register clock pins.  "\fBpositive\fR" Selects positive clock phases.  "\fBnegative\fR" Selects negative clock phases.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
