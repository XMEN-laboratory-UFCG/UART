.SH Name \fBloadDrc\fR \-  Loads the specified Design Rule Checking (DRC) violation marker file
.SH Syntax \fBloadDrc\fR  [-help]   <fileName>  [-incremental]  [-orient {r0 | r90 | r180 | r270 | mx | mx90 | my | my90}]  [-origin <x y>] 
.P Loads the specified Design Rule Checking (DRC) violation marker file. Use this command to load DRC markers, which are saved in DB format, into Innovus design. The loadDrc command is useful in situations when you want to load DRC violation markers without having to load an entire design.
.P For example, if during an Engineering Change Order (ECO), you find that only 25 of the 300 reported violations are actual violations that need to be corrected immediately, you can:
.RS  "*" 2 Delete the other 275 violations.  "*" 2 Save the 25 actual violations in a marker file using the saveDrc command.  "*" 2 Clear the violations from the design window.  "*" 2 Load the marker file containing the saved violation markers using the loadDrc command.
.RE
.P You can also use the loadDrc command in situations where, when correcting violations, the ECO editor didn't make changes in the way that you want. Because the editor removed the marker when it made the change, you cannot find the original violation in the design. You can use the loadDrc command to load the original marker file, then click on the violation, and zoom to the area in which you are working on. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each loadDrc parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man loadDrc  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the marker file to be loaded.  "\fB-incremental\fR" Loads the markers stored in the specified file incrementally. This means that the markers that are already loaded in memory will not be removed before new ones are loaded from the specified file.  "\fB-orient {r0 | r90 | r180 | r270 | mx | mx90 | my | my90}\fR" Rotates all the DRCs available in the violation marker file with the specified orientation.   "\fB-origin <x y>\fR" Specifies the origin coordinate of the DRC available in the violation marker file. 
.SH Example
.P The following command loads markers that were previously saved to the VG.drc file using saveDrc:
.P loadDrc VG.drc
