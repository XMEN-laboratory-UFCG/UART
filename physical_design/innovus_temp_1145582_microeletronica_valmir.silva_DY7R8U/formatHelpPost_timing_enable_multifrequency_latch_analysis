.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_multifrequency_latch_analysis\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_enable_multifrequency_latch_analysis\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Enables multi-frequency latch timing analysis of the latch time borrowing for when a data signal coming to a latch is controlled by a clock with a frequency different to a clock of the latch enabling signal.
.P When set to true, the edges of all sending and receiving clocks are analyzed at every latch, which results in less pessimistic, and more detailed timing analysis.
.P When set to false, latch time borrowing analysis uses the worst case relationship between sending and receiving clocks at the latch, which can produce paths with pessimistic slack.
.P Note: Enabling advanced latch analysis can result in some performance penalty.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
