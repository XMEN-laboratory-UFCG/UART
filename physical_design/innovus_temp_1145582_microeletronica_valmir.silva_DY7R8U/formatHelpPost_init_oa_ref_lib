.TH init_oa_ref_lib  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBinit_oa_ref_lib\fR
.SH Syntax   \fBinit_oa_ref_lib\fR <list_of_OA_libs> 
.P Type: String
.P Default: NULL
.P Specifies the list of OpenAccess reference libraries to import. Each reference library is processed using the abstract view name list (init_abstract_view). The first library in the list indicates the library that will be used for the technology information unless init_oa_design_lib is specified. All cells from the specified libraries are read. It is important to include the standard cell library in the list to make sure that cells that are not in the current netlist are read and available for optimization. The init_abstract_view and init_layout_view lists specify which views of the cells are read. Used by the init_design command.
.P For example, if the reference library is "lib1 lib2", and the abstract view name list is "abstract  abstract2", LEF MACRO information is processed for lib1 with the abstract view. Then, for any cells in lib1 that do not have abstract but do have abstract2, that view is processed for MACRO information. If a cell has both views, the first one is used. The process then is repeated for lib2.
.P The init_oa_ref_lib variable cannot be used with init_lef_file. init_oa_ref_lib replaces the previous rda_Input(ui_oa_reflib) configuration file variable. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies OAREFLIB1 OAREFLIB2 as the OpenAccess reference libraries.   set init_oa_ref_lib {OAREFLIB1 OAREFLIB2}
