.P Adds either a single buffer or two inverters on a net. This allows you to optionally specify the location and radius, the location relative to the sink pin, and the buffer insertion based on the slack. This command also checks for and observes power domains based on the specified instance name and location. This command cuts wires by default.
.P This command does not modify dont_touch nets if setEcoMode -honorDontTouch is set to true.
.P Notes:
.RS  "*" 2 The ecoAddRepeater command is simultaneous setup/hold and MMMC aware. To make the command simultaneous setup/hold aware, set the global variable set_global timing_enable_simultaneous_setup_hold_mode to true. The simultaneous setup/hold mode can only be used for timing analysis. It cannot be used for any physical implementation steps.  By default, if you specify an inverter as the master cell, ecoAddRepeater adds a pair of inverters but if you set setEcoMode-LEQCheck as false, ecoAddRepeater adds a single inverter only.  "*" 2 ecoAddRepeater can return new instance and net name: newInstName inputNet outputNet  Example  set result [ecoAddRepeater -net s2_hresp0 -cell inv_32 \\  -loc {1069.018666 128.2435714}]  set newInstName [lindex $result 0]  set inputNetName [lindex $result 1]  set outputNetName [lindex $result 2]  If a pair of inverter is added then the return list could be the following, assuming inv1OutputNet drives the input pin of inv2InstName:  {inv1InstName inv1InputNet inv1OutputNet inv2InstName inv2InputNet inv2OutputNet}  "*" 2 When ecoAddRepeater is used in the post-mask ECO, ensure that it is used with the -noPlace option to avoid base layer change. Also, call ecoPlace -useSpareCells or ecoSwapSpareCell to map the new repeater to the spare cell. If you plan to call ecoRoute -modifyOnlyLayersbottomLayer:topLayer later, ensure that the added repeater can be connected through the specified layer. Otherwise, please do not use the ecoAddRepeater command. You can also use loadECO <ecofile> -postMask to add repeaters in the post-mask ECO.
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each ecoAddRepeater.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man ecoAddRepeater  "\fB-bufOrient {R0 | R90 | R180 | R270 | MX | MX90 | MY | MY90}\fR" Specifies the legalized orientation for the instance.  Valid orientation values are: R0, R90, R180, R270, MX, MX90, MY, MY90.  Note: The -loc option is required with -bufOrient.  For more information on orientation keys, see "Orientation Key" in the Floorplanning the Design chapter of the Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-cell <cell1 cell2
...>\fR" Specifies the name of the cell(s) which is to be inserted as repeater.  "\fB-hinstGuide <hinstName>\fR" Indicates the module hierarchy in which the inst is inserted by Tempus or a third party tool so that Innovus is able to make the association in case the instance appears in the -termList option of an ECO command at a later stage. This option can be only used when setEcoMode -batchMode true command is specified. You also need to specify the -name option along with it.  "\fB-loc {x y | x1 y1 x2 y2}\fR" Specifies the x and y coordinates for the location of the buffer or inverter pair to insert. If no location is specified, the tool will automatically determine a location.
.RS  "*" 2 If the cell is a buffer and location is specified, the newly created buffer is placed at the specified location (x y).  "*" 2 If multiple buffers are added in the same ecoAddRepeater command, the buffers are added in the order of their locations, starting from the buffer farthest from the net's driver.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If the cell is an inverter pair and two locations are specified, the first inverter will be placed at location (x1 y1) and the second inverter will be placed at location (x2 y2).
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If the cell is an inverter pair and only one location is specified, both inverters will be placed at the same location (x y).
.RE   "\fB-logicalChangeOnly\fR" Specifies that buffer/inverter addition should be done in the logical-only mode.   "\fB-name <instName>\fR" Specifies the base name for the repeater to be inserted.  When -cell is inverter, you can specify two names for inverter pair enclosed in {{ }}.   "\fB-net <netName >\fR" Specifies the name of the net where the buffer will be inserted.  "\fB-newNetName <netName>\fR" Specifies the base name for the new net created for the repeater insertion.  When -cell is inverter, you can specify two names for inverter pair enclosed in {{ }}.   Example：ecoAddRepeater -net DTMF_INST/ARB_INST/n_36 -cell INVX4 -name {{cell1 cell2}} -newNetName {{net1 net2}}  Before：  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   After：(<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)    "\fB-noPlace  \fR" Specifies that the inserted cells should not be placed. Only the logical change in connectivity will be made.  "\fB-offLoadAtLoc {x1a y1a x1b y1b x2a y2a x2b y2b
....}\fR" Specifies the location(s) at which buffer (or inverter-pair) should be inserted to drive the sinks downstream from the location(s).  "\fB-offLoadSlack <slack>\fR" Inserts a buffer to offload the paths with less than the specified slack threshold from the driver of a net with multiple cells. This option ignores the <term> option, if it is provided. This option is used to connect the added buffer to drive only noncritical receivers, selected By Slack. This checks the timing graph for noncritical receivers and offloads those from the critical path, and could improve critical path timing by penalizing noncritical path delays.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 The -offLoadAtLoc and -offLoadSlack options are mutually exclusive.  "*" 2 The -loc and -offLoadSlack options are mutually exclusive.
.RE   "\fB-radius m  \fR" Specifies the radius in which the added instances are free to move. If no legal location can be found in the specified radius, the cells would be placed at the specified location resulting in an overlap with other cells. In that case, you should perform legalization.  Note: When the -radius option is used in ecoAddRepeater, {[-loc] [-relativeDistToSink] [-offLoadAtLoc]} must be specified.  "\fB-relativeDistToSink <sinkWeight>\fR" Specifies the location of the buffer based on its distance from the sink or the driver pin. The value is a number between 0 and 1. A low value (0.1) places the buffer near the sink; a high value (0.9) places the buffer near the driver. The fraction is based on the length of the wire.  This option works:
.RS  "*" 2 When one term is provided; it does not work if no term or multiple terms are specified.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When -net with 1-sink net is provided. It does not work if the specified net is not a 1-sink net.
.RE   "\fB-spreadCount <number>\fR" Specifies the number of repeaters to be added for buffering.  Minimum: 1  Maximum: INT_MAX  "\fB-spreadDist <distance>\fR" Specifies the distance (starting from the driver) after which repeaters are to be added.  Minimum: 2.2250738585072e-308  Maximum: 1073741.823  "\fB-spreadPrefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies the prefix to be used for new instances and nets added during the spread buffering.   "\fB-term <term1 term2>...   \fR" Specifies a list of terms. The terms specified in the list should be connected to a common net and the tool adds buffer to the common net. If -term is not specified, all the terms of the net will be buffered.
.P Note: You can specify the following in the setEcoMode command:
.P setEcoMode -honorFixedStatus false #to modify FIXED instance.  setEcoMode -honorDontUse false #to modify instances which have dontUse attribute on cells.  setEcoMode -honorDontTouch false #to modify instance/nets which are marked dontUse.
.P setECOMode -honorFixedNetWire false #to insert a cell on wires with the FIXED/COVER status and change the status of these wires from FIXED/COVER to ROUTED.
