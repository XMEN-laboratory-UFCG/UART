.P Creates a named delay calculation corner object that can be referenced later when creating an analysis view. A delay calculation corner provides all of the information necessary to control delay calculation for a specific view. Each corner contains information on the libraries to use, the operating conditions with which the libraries should be accessed, and the RC extraction parameters to use for calculating parasitic data. Delay corner objects can be shared by multiple top-level analysis views.    Note: The -early_* and -late_* parameters should not be used to represent best and worst case corners.  Instead use separate delay corners to define Best-Case and Worst-Case differences. Use the -early_* and -late_* parameters within a single delay calculation corner to control on-chip variation.  In this latter situation different conditions or libraries will be used for the launch and capture paths of individual timing paths.
.P Note: A single delay calculation corner object specifies the delay calculation rules for the entire design. If a design includes power domains, the delay calculation corner can contain domain-specific subsections that specify the required operating condition information, and any necessary timing library rebinding for the power domain. Use the update_delay_corner command to add a power domain definition to a delay calculation corner. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-early_estimated_worst_irDrop_factor <percent>\fR" Specifies the early voltage derating factor.

Default: Each library in the early library set uses its own default operating condition.  "\fB-early_opcond_library <libName>\fR" Specifies the internal library name for the library in which the early operating condition is defined. This is not the library file name.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Default: The software searches the early library set for the specified operating condition (-early_opcond), starting with the master library.  "\fB-early_rc_corner <rcCornerObj>\fR" Specifies the RC corner object to associate with the early corner object.  "\fB-early_temp_file <tempName>\fR" Specifies the name of the temperature file for temperature aware delay calculation for early corner.

This parameter is used primarily to configure single-corner or Best-Case Worst-Case (BC-WC) analysis modes.  Note: This parameter is obsolete and will be removed in a future release. To ensure compatibility with future releases, you should update your scripts.  "\fB-late_estimated_worst_irDrop_factor <percent>\fR" Specifies the late voltage derating factor.   When this parameter is specified, the software performs delay calculations using the voltage = nomVolt * (1 - value).  Default: 0.0  "\fB-late_irdrop_data <files_or_directories>\fR" Specifies the IR drop files or directories to apply when calculating the late arrival times at a single delay corner.  "\fB-late_irdrop_file <list_of_files>\fR" Specifies the list of IR drop files to apply when calculating late arrival times at a single delay corner.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Note: This parameter is obsolete and will be removed in a future release. To ensure compatibility with future releases, you should update your scripts.  "\fB-late_library_set <libSetObj>\fR" Specifies the library set to associate with this delay corner object for calculating late arrival times at a single delay corner.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  "\fB-late_opcond <opcondName>\fR" Specifies the operating condition to use for calculating late arrival times at a single delay corner.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Default: Each library in the late library set uses its own default operating condition.  "\fB-late_opcond_library <libName>\fR" Specifies the internal library name for the library in which the late operating condition is defined. This is not the library file name.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Default: The software searches the late library set for the specified operating condition (-late_opcond), starting with the master library.  "\fB-late_rc_corner <rcCornerObj>\fR" Specifies the RC corner object to associate with the late corner object.  "\fB-late_temp_file <tempName>\fR" Specifies the name of the temperature file for temperature aware delay calculation for late corner.  "\fB-library_set <libSetObj(s)>\fR" Specifies the library set(s) to associate with this delay corner object. To configure an ECSM-based multi-library interpolation , you should specify a Tcl list of library_set, such as:  create_delay_corner -name dc_P1_T1  -library_set {p1_v1_t1  p1_v2_t1  p1_v3_t1}  "\fB-name <delayCornerName>\fR" Specifies the name for the delay corner object being created.  "\fB-opcond <opcondName>\fR" Specifies the operating condition to use for setup and hold analysis.  This parameter is used primarily to configure single-corner or Best-Case Worst-Case (BC-WC) analysis modes.  Default: Each library in the library set uses its own default operating condition.

This parameter is used primarily to configure OCV and Best-Case Worst-Case (BC-WC) analysis modes.  "\fB-si_enabled {true | false}\fR" Controls signal integrity (SI) analysis.  When set to true, the analysis of all MMMC views will include SI analysis by default. You can use this parameter to further determine which analysis views receive SI analysis and which do not.  When this parameter is set to false on a delay corner, the software will disable SI analysis for all the views that reference that corner. By default (or when this parameter is set to true), SI analysis is computed for all the views related to that corner - whenever SI is globally enabled. (The global control of signal integrity (SI) analysis is determined by the setDelayCalMode -SIAware setting.)  "\fB-temp_file <tempName>\fR" Specifies the name of the temperature file for temperature aware delay calculation for single corner.
