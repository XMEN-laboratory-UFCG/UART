.TH setCycleBudgetRatio  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsetCycleBudgetRatio\fR \-  Sets the budgeting constraint based on the clock cycle, which ensures that budgeting is done in minimum time and memory by deriving partition block delays from the total clock cycle time
.SH Syntax \fBsetCycleBudgetRatio\fR  [-help]  {[[[{-fromTop | -fromPtn {hinst ratio}} {-toTop | -toPtn {hinst ratio}}] ] [-clock <string>]] | [-reset ]}
.P Sets the budgeting constraint based on the clock cycle, which ensures that budgeting is done in minimum time and memory by deriving partition block delays from the total clock cycle time. This command supports:
.RS  "*" 2 Different top-level ratios based on critical partition to partition connections
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Different ratios between the partitions with different sources and sinks
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Clock-based segment control
.RE
.P Note: This command (cycle-based budget) does not support nested partition. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setCycleBudgetRatio parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man setCycleBudgetRatio  "\fB-clock <string>\fR" Presents the clock name for which the ratio is to be applied. If specified, the cycle time ratio is applied to the paths only from the specific clock. If not specified, all clocks path are impacted with same percentage of cycle time.  "\fB-fromPtn {hinst ratio}\fR" Specifies that the start of a timing path segment is inside the mentioned hierarchical instance, which should get the mentioned cycle ratio for budgeting.  "\fB-fromTop\fR" Specifies that the start of a timing path segment is at the top level.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all the previously declared ratio budgets/contraints.  "\fB-toPtn {hinst ratio}\fR" Specifies that the end of a timing path segment is inside the mentioned hierarchical instance, which should get the mentioned cycle ratio for budgeting.  "\fB-toTop\fR" Specifies that the end of a timing path segment is at the top level. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands present an example of the TOP to PTN path:  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromTop -toPtn {* 0.6}  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromTop -toPtn {ptn1_hinst 0.7}  Note: * matches with any partition hinst. However, it does not matches with TOP.  Following is the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 The following commands present an example of the PTN to TOP path:  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {* 0.6} -toTop  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {ptn1_hinst 0.7} -toTop  Note: * matches with any partition hinst. However, it does not matches with TOP.  Following is the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 The following commands present an example of reserving TOP percentage:  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {* 0.6} -toTop  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromTop -toPtn {* 0.6}  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {* 0.3} -toPtn {* 0.3}  Note: * matches with any partition hinst. However, it does not matches with TOP.  Following is the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 The following command presents an example of the PTN to PTN path:  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {ptn1_hinst 0.6} -toPtn {ptn2_hinst 0.3}  Following is the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 The following command presents an example of the PTN to PTN Abutted path:  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {ptn1_hinst 0.6} -toPtn {ptn2_hinst 0.3}  Path is over-constrained by 10% of clock cycle. Following is the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 The following command presents an example of how the top level budget is split into top and FT segments of the paths:  setCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {ptn1_hinst 0.4} -toPtn {ptn2_hinst 0.3}  Note: FT segment is over-constrined and given 0% budget.  Following is the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2 Following are two examples of actual delay-based cycle ratio:  Example 1:  Suppose PhaseShift = 10nssetCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {P1 0.4} -toPtn {P3 0.4}setFixedBudget -through {P2} -slack 0 ;# implies that the budget of P2 is as is  Then,P2 budget = 1ns (assuming that the actual delay through P2 is 1ns)AvailableTime = 10ns - 1ns = 9nsP1 budget = 0.4 * AvailableTime = 0.4 * 9ns = 3.6nsP3 budget = 0.4 * AvailableTime = 0.4 * 9ns = 3.6nsTOP budget = 9ns - 3.6ns - 3.6ns = 1.8ns  So each of the two TOP segments get 0.9ns.  Following is the output:   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  Example 2:  Suppose PhaseShift = 10nssetCycleBudgetRatio -fromPtn {P1 0.5} -toPtn {P3 0.5}setFixedBudget -through {P2} -slack 0 ;# implies budget of P2 is as is  Then,P2 budget = 1ns (assuming that the actual delay through P2 is 1ns)AvailableTime = 10ns - 1ns = 9nsP1 budget = 0.5 * AvailableTime = 0.5 * 9ns = 4.5nsP3 budget = 0.5 * AvailableTime = 0.5 * 9ns = 4.5nsTOP budget = 9ns - 4.5ns - 4.5ns = 0ns  So each of the two TOP segments get 0ns.  Following is the output:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
