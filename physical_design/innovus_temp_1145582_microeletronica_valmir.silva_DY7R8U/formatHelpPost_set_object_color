.SH Name \fBset_object_color\fR \-  Sets the color for objects of the specified name or type
.SH Syntax \fBset_object_color\fR  [-help]   {[-object_name <InstOrHInstN> <ame> | -object_type <typeList>]   [-multicolor | -color_id <colorID>]  [-include_children {off | color | multicolor}]   [-reset]} 
.P Sets the color for objects of the specified name or type. You can choose to include children when specifying object color for a hierarchical instance (HInst).
.P The set_object_color command is typically used during floorplanning to color objects that are currently displayed in the design display area. You can use this command to distinguish between objects of different type or between objects belonging to different instances, hierarchical instances, instance groups, or power domains.
.P Before using the set_object_color command, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Loaded the floorplan
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Ungrouped objects so that only required objects are displayed in the design display area in the Floorplan or Physical view.
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each set_object_color parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man set_object_color.  "\fB-color_id <colorID>\fR" Specifies the color ID from 0 to 29. The color value for the color ID is the same as specified in the Module Color Preference form (accessed by clicking Floorplan - Edit Floorplan - Color Module).  Default: Color ID 0  "\fB-include_children {off | color | multicolor}\fR" Specifies whether the children of the hierarchical instance will  be colored simultaneously when you specify a color for an  HInst. You can set one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 off: The child instances will not be colored.  "*" 2 color: The child instances are colored the same color as their parent instance.  "*" 2 multicolor: The child instances are colored in multiple colors.
.RE   "\fB-multicolor\fR" Uses multiple colors to color objects of the specified type, instance, or hierarchical instance.   "\fB-object_name <InstOrHInstN> <ame>\fR" Specifies the name of the instance, hierarchical instance, power domain, or instance group whose objects are to be colored. You can specify an object list, such as objectName {A,B} for <objName>.  "\fB-object_type <type><List>\fR" Specifies the list of type of objects that are to be colored, such as BusGuide, Module, PowerDomain, and InstGroup.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets the object color. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command colors the DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST instance with color 3, as specified in the Module Color Preference form:   set_object_color -object_name DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST -color_id 3
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command colors the DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST instance and its children with color 3, as specified in the Module Color Preference form:   set_object_color -object_name DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST -color_id 3 -include_children color
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command colors the children of the DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST instance in multiple colors:   set_object_color -object_name DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST -include_children multicolor
