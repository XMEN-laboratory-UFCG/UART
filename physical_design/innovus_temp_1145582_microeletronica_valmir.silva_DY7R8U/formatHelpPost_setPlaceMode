.P Controls certain aspects of how the software places cells.
.P Use the getPlaceModecommand to return the current settings for the setPlaceMode command.
.P The setPlaceMode parameters affect the behavior of the following commands:
.RS  "*" 2 place_design
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 refinePlace  Note: Parameters specified by the place_design or refinePlace commands supersede those specified by the setPlaceMode command.
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-place_design_floorplan_mode {true | false}\fR" Runs placement in floorplan mode. This mode is used for prototyping and runs quickly to gauge the feasibility of the netlist, but might not place design components in legal locations.  Note: When -place_design_floorplan_mode is set to true, it disables congestion-driven placement. Option -place_global_cong_effort is set to low.  Default: false  "\fB-place_design_refine_macro {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether to run refine_macro_place after place_design -concurrent_macros. When place_design -concurrent_macros is run, it sets the value of setPlaceMode -place_opt_run_global_place to seed.  Default: false  "\fB-place_design_refine_place {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to run detailed placement (refinePlace) to legalize placed standard cells.  If setDesignMode -powerEffort is set to high, -place_design_refine_place automatically set to true.  Default: true  "\fB-place_detail_activity_power_driven {true|false}\fR" When true, it turns on the activity-driven tweakage, and flow change depends on the effort.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_allow_border_pin_abut {true | false}\fR" Some libraries have cells with pin geometry that is not set back by half-routing pitch from the normal PR-boundary of that cell. In cases where the pin geometries touch the cell PR_boundary, placement of an instance of this cell can cause a DRC violation with a normal pin geometry of the other cells. To avoid these DRCs, placer will add one Site padding to the cell-side during pre-processing, thus satisfying the min-spacing rules. The -place_detail_allow_border_pin_abut option disables this pre-emptive DRC avoidance behavior, and no auto-padding is done when the option is set to true.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_allow_single_height_row_symmetry_x <siteName>\fR" Specifies a single height row tech-site, which allows symmetry X during detail place.  Default: ""  "\fB-place_detail_check_cut_spacing {true | false}\fR" Enables the via-to-via spacing check during refinePlace and checkPlace.  Default: false  This option is turned on by default for 16nm and below process designs.  "\fB-place_detail_check_inst_space_group {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether the distance between instances that belong to the same space group would be honored during placement.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_check_route {true | false}\fR" Considers pre-routed FIXED signal wires and avoids creating DRC violations between FIXED signal wires and instance pins. When this parameter is not specified, refinePlace ignores FIXED signal wires.  Default: false  Note: Using this parameter might result in longer run time.  If you specify refinePlace -place_detail_io_pin_blockage, you do not need to specify -place_detail_check_route for signal pins because refinePlace will treat the signal pins similar to supply pins for blockages. However, signal wires still need this parameter.  "\fB-place_detail_color_aware_legal {true | false}\fR" Enables placer to honor and fix double pattern constraint violations between adjacent cells.  Default: false  Note: This option does not affect cell to pre-route color DRC checks.  "\fB-place_detail_context_aware_legal {none|all|optional|required|user|ignore_soft}\fR" Instructs placer to support cell edge to cell edge spacing constraints as defined in the LEF files.  The optional, required, user, ignore_soft argument values can be used separately or together, but they are exclusive to all and none.   Default: all  "\fB-place_detail_eco_max_distance <maxDistance>\fR" Specifies max distance, in microns, in the horizontal or vertical direction for the refinePlace ECO mode.  For example, if the original location of the instance is at (x0 y0) and the specified eco max distance is M, the search window will be (x0-M, yo-M) (x0+M y0+M). The maximum movement should be less than 2M.  Default: 0   Minimum: 0.000000  Maximum: 9999.000000  If -place_detail_eco_max_distance is not defined by the user, and the user does refinePlace -eco, the value of -place_detail_eco_max_distance is internally set to 10 Standard Cell height units.    Note: This option will impact both refinePlace -eco and refinePlace -inst.  "\fB-place_detail_eco_priority_insts {placed|fixed|eco}\fR" Specifies the instance priority for refinePlace ECO mode.
.RS  "*" 2 placed: Treats current instances as placeable but with higher priority.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 fixed: Treats placed instances as fixed.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 eco: Treats ECO instances with higher priority.
.RE   Default: placed  "\fB-place_detail_fixed_shifter {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to set the shifters to FIXED status after placing them.  When set to true, the level shifters are FIXED after placement. However, the placement for some of the level shifters can be skipped due to the following reasons:
.RS  "*" 2 The shifter has no connections outside its power domains.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The shifter has no valid location. 
.RE   Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_honor_inst_pad {true|false}\fR" Honors padding from specifyInstPad in detail placement.  Default:false  When this option is set to true, instance padding is also considered in refinePlace and checkPlace.  "\fB-place_detail_io_pin_blockage {true|false} \fR" Treats ioPins from top-level as pre-routes during DRV checks in legalization.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_iraware_max_drive_strength <maxDriveStrength>\fR" Specifies the current density value for the IR critical instances above which the instances gets padded during refinePlace. This means that the IR critical instances with the current density value more than the specified value gets padded.  Note: There may be larger cell movement with this option, which can degrade the timing. So, it is preferred to be used at the pre-CTS stage in the flow. The current density values for the IR-critical instances are dumped in the Voltus Reports.  Default: 0   Minimum: 0  Maximum: 2147483647  "\fB-place_detail_irdrop_aware_effort {none|low|medium|high}\fR" Used to enable the IR-aware feature in refinePlace. You can use the following settings to specify IR-drop optimization effort level to be used during refinePlace.  You can specify the following optimization effort levels:
.RS  "*" 2 none: Disables the feature, default value.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 low: Moves the IR-violating instances to nearby rows (in the vertical direction). The aggressor has the same priority as the other instances during legalization.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 medium: : Moves the IR violating instances in both horizontal and vertical directions. The aggressor has higher priority than the other instances during legalization.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 high: Moves the aggressor instances to nearby rows. The aggressor has higher priority than the other instances during legalization and considers the IR-drop violation as a hard rule during legalization. This option is not recommended in this version.
.RE   Default: none  "\fB-place_detail_irdrop_aware_timing_effort {none|standard|high}\fR" Specifies the timing-effort level to be used during IR-aware refinePlace.  You can specify the following timing effort levels:
.RS  "*" 2 none: Disables the feature, refineplace is not timing aware. Tool uses the default value.  "*" 2 medium: refineplace is timing aware and minimizes the movement of the timing sensitive instances during refineplace.  "*" 2 high: refineplace is timing aware and does not move the timing sensitive instances during refineplace.
.RE   Default: high  "\fB-place_detail_irdrop_region_number <valueOfDebugIrdrop>\fR" Specifies the total number of regions in which the tool identifies the IR-violating instances. The tool dumps the IR-violating instances inside these regions in the reports.  Default: 100  "\fB-place_detail_legalization_inst_gap <numberOfSites>\fR" Specifies the minimum sites gap between instances.  Default: 0  "\fB-place_detail_max_shifter_column_depth <microns>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance from a vertical side that a shifter can be placed.  Default: 999 (no effect)  "\fB-place_detail_max_shifter_depth <microns>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance from a horizontal or vertical side that a shifter can be placed.  Default: 999 (no effect)  "\fB-place_detail_max_shifter_row_depth <microns>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance from a horizontal side that a shifter can be placed. The distance is measured from the power domain boundary, not from the edge of the placeable areas and accounts for gaps.  Default: 999 (no effect)  "\fB-place_detail_no_filler_without_implant {true|false}\fR" Specifies that there is no cell without the implant obs. For designs in which all standard cells and fillers have implant obs, you can specify this option to preserve enough spacing during refinePlace for later filler insertion.   Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_pad_fixed_insts {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether the refinePlace command honors cell padding on FIXED instances.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_pad_physical_cells {true|false}\fR" Honors cell-padding for physical instances in refinePlace and addFiller.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_preroute_as_obs {<layerNum>
...}\fR" Specifies layers on which preroute are taken as OBS.   You can change this behavior by using the following command before running placement:  setPlaceMode -place_detail_preroute_as_obs  Default: ""  Note: This option is not recommended for Advanced nodes of 20nm and below.  "\fB-place_detail_preserve_routing {true | false}\fR" Preserves all routed wires. This option is applicable to all the calls in refinePlace, either stand-alone, or internal to place_opt_design.  Default: true. refinePlace deletes all routed wires.  "\fB-place_detail_remove_affected_routing {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether refinePlace removes wires connected to moved cells only or to all cells.   Default:  false.   Removes all wires, whether connected cells were moved or not.   "\fB-place_detail_sdp_alignment_in_refine {true|false}  \fR" Calls sdp alignment in every refinePlace.  Default: false.   "\fB-place_detail_swap_eeq_cells {true | false}\fR" Determines whether master cells can be replaced by EEQ cells during detailed placement to improve routability. After detailed placement, the software reports the number of replacements. EEQ cells are defined in the LEF file.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_use_check_drc {true|false}\fR" Enables the FGC engine inside placement for DRC checking. This DRC engine is the same as one used by NanoRoute and verify_drc.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_use_diffusion_transition_fill {true|false}\fR" Specifies that the design has fillers with jogged diffusion obs
. For designs where fillers with jogged diffusion obs are to be inserted between cells with varying diffusion widths, please specify this option.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_use_GA_filler_groups {true|false}\fR" Specifies that filler cell insts will only be replaced by logic insts that belong to the same GA groups.   Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_use_no_diffusion_one_site_filler {true|false}\fR" Specifies that all one-site fillers do not have diffusion obs. For designs in which all one-site fillers without diffusion obs, you can use this option to preserve enough spacing during refinePlace for later filler insertion. This option can override the setting of -place_detail_legalization_inst_gap to 0.  Default: false  "\fB-place_detail_wire_length_opt_effort {none|medium|high}\fR" Optimizes wire length by swapping cells. Optimization can reduce the total wire length up to two percent without degrading placement. In high-effort mode, it might add up to ten percent to the run time.  Default: medium  "\fB-place_global_activity_power_driven {false|true}  \fR" Identifies and constrains power-critical nets to reduce switching power.  Default: false  "\fB-place_global_activity_power_driven_effort {none|standard|high}\fR" Specifies place_global_activity_power_driven_effort mode.  Default: standard  "\fB-place_global_align_macro {true|false}\fR" Enables mixed-placer to align nearby same-size macros during the global placement.  Default: true  "\fB-place_global_allow_3d_stack {true|false}\fR" Enables the 3D placement.  Default: false  "\fB-place_global_auto_blockage_in_channel {none | soft| partial}\fR" Creates placement blockages in narrow channels between macros before Global Placement
.RS  "*" 2 soft: Adds physical soft blockages by calling the finishFloorplan command.  "*" 2 partial: Creates a partial blockage whose density will be determined automatically.  "*" 2 none: Prevents the creation of blockage automatically by placer.
.RE   Default: none  Note: The "soft" option only prevents cells being placed inside the channels during global placement. refinePlace called by optimization can still place the cells inside the channels.  Note: The threshold to activate the soft blockage insertion when the option is set to "soft" is when the channels between macros are less than 50 um in width.  "\fB-place_global_clock_gate_aware {true | false}\fR" Specifies that placement is aware of clock gate cells in the design.   Default: true.  Note: -place_global_clock_gate_aware now finds better placement for clock gating elements towards the center of gravity for fanout.  "\fB-place_global_clock_power_driven {true|false}\fR" Improves clock wirelength and subsequently clock power by adding more weight to clock nets between clock gates and their respective Flops.  Default: true  "\fB-place_global_clock_power_driven_effort {low|standard|high}\fR" Specifies the place_global_clock_power_driven_effort mode.  Default: low  "\fB-place_global_cong_effort {low | medium | high |auto}\fR" Specifies the effort level for relieving congestion.  Default: auto  Specify one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 auto: Automatically determines whether the design is congested and performs extra congestion driven effort for highly congested designs.   "*" 2 high: Runs more iterations of placement in an effort to achieve better congestion results. This parameter increases the run time.  "*" 2 low: Runs fewer iterations of placement to arrive quickly at a legal placement. This parameter might decrease placement quality.   "*" 2 medium: Runs placement on designs at a normal effort level.
.RE   "\fB-place_global_cpg_effort {low|medium|high}\fR" Specifies the effort level of pushing instances to the guided locations during the CPG flow.  With higher level, placement will increase the force to push instances to the guided locations, but might degrade wire length and timing QOR  Note: This option need to be specified together with -place_global_cpg_file.  Default: low  "\fB-place_global_cpg_file <cpgFileName>\fR" Specifies the CPG guide file. When this option is specified, the CPG flow is turned ON automatically.  Default: ""  Note: To run the CPG flow, you must save a guide file from the old version DB and read it during the mixed placement flow on the new version netlist.   "\fB-place_global_enable_advanced_pipeline {true|false}\fR" Enables advanced pipeline placement.  Default: false   "\fB-place_global_enable_distributed_place {true|false}\fR" Enables distributed placement platform.   Default: false   Note: This option is part of a limited-access feature in this release. It is enabled by a variable specified using the setLimitedAccessFeature command. To use this feature, contact your Cadence representative to explain your usage requirements, and make sure this feature meets your needs before deploying it widely.    "\fB-place_global_ignore_scan{true|1|false|0|auto}\fR" Disregards scan connections while placing the instances that belong to scan chains. Before you place the design, you must already have specified the scan cells with the specifyScanCell command, or the scan cell information must be in the timing library.  Default: true  Note: Scan groups are sometimes called scan partitions.  "\fB-place_global_ignore_spare {true | false}\fR" Disregards spare cell connections while placing spare cells. Before you place the design, you must already have specified the spare cells with the specifySpareGate command, or the spare cell information must be in the timing library.  Default: false.  place_design ignores spare cell connections.  Note: The placer disconnects high-fanout (nets with more than 75 terminals) from spare cells, even when this parameter is set to false.  "\fB-place_global_max_density <value>\fR" Controls the maximum density of local bins during global placement. Sets the maximum density of core area so that the placement engine satisfies the maximum density constraint while working on timing, wire length, and congestion.  Use a value between 0 (zero percent) and 1 (100 percent). For example, a value of 0.5 indicates that the maximum density in the entire design will be 50 percent or less.  Default: -1.000  Note: It is recommended that the place_global_max_density value should be greater than standard cell utilization of design.  Note: Using this option might degrade congestion and timing QOR of Global placement.  "\fB-place_global_module_aware_spare {true | false}\fR" Places spare cells in the netlist within a hierarchical module, even if no region or fence constraints are specified.
.RS  "*" 2 When this parameter is true, spare cells in a logical hierarchy are placed within the bounds of the hierarchy.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When this parameter is false, spare cells are spread out within the placement area, and are not bound to a hierarchical module.
.RE   Default: false  "\fB-place_global_module_padding <module> <factor>\fR" Specifies a module in which to add padding (placement clearance) and a factor to use to calculate the padding dimension. Adding padding reduces placement density and localized congestion (hotspots) by spreading out cell instances in the specified modules. Module padding provides guidance for global placement only, and is ignored during placement legalization (refinePlace).  Default: "" (empty string)
.RS  "*" 2 module: Specifies a hierarchical instance to which the factor applies. You can use "prefix matching" when you specify the instance name. For example, you can use the following command to specify the module padding for all u_ram_block_{2,4,6} module.  setPlaceMode -place_global_module_padding {u_ram_block_ 2.0}   "*" 2 factor: Specifies a factor to use to calculate the padding dimension. The placer multiplies the instance area of all cell instances under the specified module by the factor. For example, a factor of 2 means that the placer "sees" each cell as twice its actual size. In most cases, a factor of 1.2 (which increases the area by 20 percent) is good enough. The placer ignores factors that are less than 1.0.
.RE   Default: 1  "\fB-place_global_place_io_pins {true | false}\fR" Moves placed and unplaced I/O pins, based on the placement of connected instances in an attempt to find a better I/O pin placement than the one specified in the I/O pin placement or floorplan file. At the end of global placement, the I/O pin location is legalized.  When the value of this parameter is false, I/O pins are ignored during global placement and no legalization is done at the end.  Default: false  Note: If place_design does not place the standard cells, for example if all instances are fixed or if there is no placeable area, then place_design also skips I/O pin assignment.   "\fB-place_global_reorder_scan {true | false}\fR" Performs scan chain reordering after placement.  If you specify false for this parameter, the software does not perform scan chain reordering after placement.  Default: true  "\fB-place_global_soft_guide_strength {low | medium | high}\fR" Instructs placement engine to place those modules which have been specified as softguide in the floorplan file closer. The degree of closeness depends on the strength given.  In case, there are fixed/preplaced instances, the module placed gets affected by those fixed instances and therefore placed close to them.  Default: low  "\fB-place_global_sdp_alignment {true|false}\fR" Ensures SDP alignment during the global cell placement.  The user-specified SDP alignment is preserve during the global cell placement.  Default: false  "\fB-place_global_sdp_place {false|true}]\fR" Enables SDP placement for place_opt_design command and where placer will place SDP cells closely as a group.  Default: false  "\fB-place_global_timing_effort {medium|high}\fR" Specifies the level of effort for timing driven global placer.  Note: setPlaceMode -place_global_timing_effort high is not recommended for congested designs.  Default: medium<>  Note: This option is part of a limited-access feature in this release. It is enabled by a variable specified using the setLimitedAccessFeature command. To use this feature, contact your Cadence representative to explain your usage requirements, and make sure this feature meets your needs before deploying it widely.   "\fB-place_global_uniform_density {true | false}\fR" Enable even cell distribution for designs with less than 70% utilization.  Default: false  "\fB-place_hard_fence {true|false}]\fR" Specifies whether refinePlace and checkPlace honor or ignore the fence and region placement constraints while legalizing placed instances.  Default: true (refinePlace and checkPlace honor the constraints)  Note: In optimization, the fence and region constraints are disabled by default in non-MSV designs for better timing enclosure, which is controlled by setOptMode -opt_honor_fences with the false default value. For the fence and region constraints to be honored by optimization commands, both setOptMode -opt_honor_fences and setPlaceMode -place_hard_fence must be set to true.  "\fB-place_opt_post_place_tcl <tcl_file>\fR" Sources the tcl script after placement and before running optimization inside place_opt_design.  Default: ""  "\fB-place_opt_run_global_place {none|seed|full}\fR" Changes the Global Placement behavior inside place_opt_design.
.RS  "*" 2 none: Skips place_design and runs only preCTS Optimization inside place_opt_design.  "*" 2 seed: Uses seed placement from Concurrent Macro Placement or other sources and runs incremental standard cell placement, then runs preCTS optimization.  "*" 2 full: Runs full global placement and preCTS optimization.
.RE   Default: <full>  When place_design -concurrent_macros is run, it sets the value of  setPlaceMode -place_opt_run_global_place to seed.   "\fB-place_spare_update_timing_graph {true|false}\fR" Updates the timing graph during placeSpareModule.  Default: true  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setPlaceMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.
