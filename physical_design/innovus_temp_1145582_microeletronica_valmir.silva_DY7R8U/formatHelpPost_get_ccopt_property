.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_property\fR \-  Retrieves the value of the specified CCOpt property
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_property\fR  [-help]  name  [-cell <library_cell_name>]  [-clock_tree <clock_tree_name>]  [-clock_tree_source_group <source_group_name>]  [-delay_corner <corner_name>]  [-flexible_htree <flexibleHtreeName>]   [-help <property_name>]  [-inst <instance_name>]  [-lib_pin <lib_pin_name>]   [-list]  [-net <net_name>]   [-net_type leaf | trunk | top]  [-pin <pin_name>]   [-power_domain <domain_name>]  [-skew_group <skew_group_name>]  [-early | -late]   [-rise | -fall]   [-min | -max] 
.P Retrieves the value of the specified CCOpt property. It can be used in the following ways:
.RS  "*" 2 To retrieve the value of a property. Some properties are global, and others are specific to a particular object. The command returns the value of the specified property when you use get_ccopt_property <property_name>.  For example, use the following command to return the value for the maximum spatial density of clock tree cells.  get_ccopt_property cell_density  The software returns the following information:  1  "*" 2  To retrieve a list of all the available CCOpt properties - in alphabetical order, run the following command:  get_ccopt_property -help *  The software displays the following information:  add_driver_cell   additional_buffer_depth   additional_buffer_depth_skew_group_fraction  add_exclusion_drivers  adjacent_rows_legal 
..............................   "*" 2 To retrieve a list of all the available properties that start with a word or a letter, for example "a", along with their brief descriptions, run the following command:  get_ccopt_property -help a*  The software displays the following information:  add_driver_cell                                # Specify a driver cell to add for clock tree after root.  add_exclusion_drivers                          # Setting this property true causes CCOpt to add extra drivers above exclude pins to remove them from the clock tree.  additional_buffer_depth                        # Relaxes the max_buffer_depth constraint by an additional N stage depths, but only for the shortest paths.  additional_buffer_depth_skew_group_fraction    # When using additional_buffer_depth, apply the relaxed constraint to specified fraction of the skew group's shortest paths.  Note: If the wildcard that is used matches many properties, as seen in above example, you will see a brief description of each property. However, if the wildcard that is used matches a single option, for example, balance_*, then the detailed description of the property will be displayed as shown in below example.   "*" 2 The get_ccopt_property command is also used to query detailed information about a specified property when you use, get_ccopt_property -help <property_name>
. The information displayed by the tool includes the usage, default value, valid values, and the object or objects that the property applies to. For example, the following command returns the information for the balance_mode property.

.P  get_ccopt_property -help clock_source_cells
.P  or 
.P  get_ccopt_property -help clock_sou*
.P  The software displays the following information:
.P Specifies the cells available for CTS to size clock sources if the property 'size_clock_source' is set to true. If none are specified CCOpt will choose cells from the libraries.
.P Cell names may be specified as a Tcl list of names, or as a Tcl list of patterns to be expanded to match names.
.P If set explicitly, CCOpt will ignore any don't use settings for the cells specified.
.P Different cells may be specified for clock trees or power domains. Only clock sources that are buffers, inverters, logic and clock gating cells with a single output can be resized.
.P Valid values: a list of library cell names, or a list of patterns to expand to library cell names
.P Default: {}
.P Optional applicable arguments: "-clock_tree <name>" and "-power_domain <name>"
.P For detailed information about how to use CCOpt properties, see the "CCOpt Property System" section in Clock Tree Synthesis chapter in Innovus User Guide. For detailed description of all public CCOpt properties, see the CCOpt Properties chapter in Innovus User Guide.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description for the get_ccopt_property command. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command: man get_ccopt_property.

"\fB-delay_corner <corner>_<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the delay corner whose property is to be returned.   "\fB-early\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the early signal.  "\fB-fall\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the fall signal.  "\fB-flexible_htree <flexibleHtreeName>\fR" Specifies the name of the flexible H-tree whose property is to be returned.   "\fB-help <property_name>\fR" Gets help for the specified property. All other options are ignored.  "\fB-inst <instance_name>\fR" Specifies the instance to which the property applies.   "\fB-late\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the late signal.   "\fB-lib_pin <lib_pin_name>\fR" Specifies the library pin to which the specific property applies.   "\fB-list\fR" Displays property values as a list.   "\fB-max\fR" Specifies that the maximum value for the property be returned.   "\fB-min\fR" Specifies that the minimum value for the property be returned.   "\fB<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the property whose value is to be returned. This parameter is required.   "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the net level to which the specified property applies.   "\fB-net_type leaf | trunk | top \fR" Specifies the net type to which the property applies. It could be leaf net, trunk net, or top net.   "\fB-pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the pin object whose property is to be returned.  "\fB-power_domain <domain_name>\fR" Specifies the power domain to which the property applies.   "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the rise signal.  "\fB-skew_group <skew_group>_<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the skew group to which the specified property applies. 
.SH Examples:
.RS  "*" 2 The following command retrieves the value of the use_inverters property:  get_ccopt_property use_inverters   The software returns the following:  auto   "*" 2 The following command gets detailed help for the specified property:  get_ccopt_property -help use_inverters  The software displays the following information:  Usage: get_ccopt_property use_inverters:  Specifies whether clock tree synthesis should prefer to use inverters rather  than buffers when balancing the clock tree. If set to true, CTS will use  inverters for the clock tree balancing process. If set to false, CTS will use  the minimum number of levels of inverters required to maintain logical  correctness. If set to auto (the default) CTS will use what it considers to be  the best combination of buffers and inverters to get optimal quality of  results.  Valid values: auto true false  Default: auto  Optional applicable arguments: "-clock_tree <name>".
