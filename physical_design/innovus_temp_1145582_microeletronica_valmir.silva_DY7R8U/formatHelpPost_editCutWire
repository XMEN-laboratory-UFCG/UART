.TH editCutWire  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBeditCutWire\fR \-  Cuts wires, bus guides, or rectangles at the specified location
.SH Syntax \fBeditCutWire\fR  [-help]   [-only_visible_wires]  [-selected]   {-lines {<x1 y1 x2 y2
...>} | -box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>} }
.P Cuts wires, bus guides, or rectangles at the specified location. You can choose to cut by line (using the -lines parameter) or by box (using the -box parameter. editCutWire honors setEditMode -cut_wire_overlap settings.
.P Patch wires are also supported. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editCutWire parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man editCutWire  "\fB-box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the lower-left and upper-right coordinates of the box for cutting wires, bus guides, or rectangles.  The -box option currently has the following limitations:
.RS  "*" 2 The cut-box must be a rectangle (or square). A polygon shape will be ignored.  "*" 2 Only the wires that are perpendicular to the cut-box edge are cut. In addition, the cut-box edge must pass across the wire, bus guide, or rectangle completely.  "*" 2 This option can be used to cut only horizontal and vertical wires. 45-degree wires are not yet supported.
.RE   "\fB-lines {<x1 y1 x2 y2
...>}\fR" Specifies the start and end coordinates of one or more line segments for cutting wires, bus guides, or rectangles.  If you specify multiple cut-line segments, they should be parallel to each other. For instance, you cannot specify one horizontal cut-line and one vertical cut-line with the -lines parameter. If you do, the tool reports the following error:  Cut lines are not parallel.  In addition, a cut-line must cut across the wire, bus guide, or rectangle from one edge to the other. Once cut, the signal wire pieces maintain a one-half wire-width extension. Special wires do not maintain an extension.  When you run editCutWire, the tool snaps the cut-line to the manufacturing grid automatically. The change in coordinates is displayed at the prompt as a warning such as follows:   WARNING: Cut-line is auto-snapped from (966.343500 1227.245500 966.811500 1227.245500) to (966.345000 1227.245000 966.810000 1227.245000).  Note that the tool records only the cut-line coordinate before snapping in the log file.  Note: The -lines option supports editing of 45-degree wire segments.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   In addition, you can also draw a 45-degree cut-line to cut a group of wires in a stair pattern as shown below:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Both regular and special wires can be cut with a 45-degree cut-line. However, patch wires cannot be cut in this way. When you use a 45-degree cut-line, the wires are cut from the touch point of the center line. You can use a single 45-degree cut-line to cut wires in different directions as shown below:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-only_visible_wires\fR" Specifies that only the wires on the visible layers are cut. If this parameter is not specified, the tool cuts all the wires overlapping with the cut-line or box.   "\fB-selected\fR" Specifies that only the selected wires, bus guides, or rectangles should be cut. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command cuts the wires through which the specified cut-line passes:   editCutWire -lines {200 300 200 310}  "*" 2  Consider the wire depicted below:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  The following command cuts the wire, along the specified 45-degree cut-line segments, {95.30 -641.16 95.39 -641.08} and {95.69 -641.17 95.78 -641.08}:   editCutWire -lines {95.30 -641.16 95.39 -641.08 95.69 -641.17 95.78 -641.08}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following diagrams show examples of using a cut-box to cut wires:
.RS  "*" 2 In a), the horizontal wire is cut. The vertical wire is not cut because the cut-box edges that are perpendicular to the wire do not pass through it completely.  "*" 2 In b), both the horizontal and vertical wires are cut.  "*" 2 In c), the vertical wire is cut at tje two places where the perpendicular edges of the cut-box pass through it completely. The horizontal wire is not cut.  "*" 2 In d), the horizontal wire is cut. The 45-degree wire is not cut because 45-degree wire edits are not yet supported while cutting by box.  "*" 2 In e), no cuts are made.
