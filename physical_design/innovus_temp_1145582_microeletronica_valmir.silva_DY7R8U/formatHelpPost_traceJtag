.SH Name \fBtraceJtag\fR \-  Traces JTAG logic between the I/O pins and the pins of given leaf instances
.SH Syntax \fBtraceJtag\fR   -infile <jtagPinFile>   -outfile <jtagInstanceFile>  
.P Traces JTAG logic between the I/O pins and the pins of given leaf instances. The input file contains a list of pins of instances that are the endpoints of JTAG logic. The command writes out a Tcl file that lists all the JTAG logic traced. You can then source the file to add this information to the Innovus database. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-infile <jtagPinFile>\fR" Specifies a file that lists the endpoints of JTAG logic. In the file, list each leaf instance or list the cell and its port.
.RS  "*" 2 To list the leaf instances, use the instpin statement, as follows:   instpin <leafInstanceName> <pinName>
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If all instances of a cell are used only in JTAG logic, you can list that cell and its port by using the cellport statement, as follows:   cellport <cellTypeName> <portName>  To avoid tracing non-JTAG cells, the cells you specify in a cellport statement must be JTAG-only cells. The cell type cannot be an intermediate cell. It must have at least one physical leaf instance.
.RE   "\fB-outfile <jtagInstanceFile>\fR" Specifies the JTAG logic file in Tcl format.
.P The following commands trace the JTAG logic based on the input file jtag.leaf, write the output file jtag.out, and add the logic specified in the file to the Innovus database:Example
.P traceJtag -infile jtag.leaf -outfile jtag.out  source jtag.out
.P Following is an example of an output file:
.P specifyJtag -inst regA  specifyJtag -inst regB  specifyJtag -inst regC  specifyJtag -inst regD  specifyJtag -inst regE  specifyJtag -inst regF  specifyJtag -inst regG  specifyJtag -inst regH
