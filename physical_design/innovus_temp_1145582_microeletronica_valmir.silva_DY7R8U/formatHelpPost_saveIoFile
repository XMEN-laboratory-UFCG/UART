.SH Name \fBsaveIoFile\fR \-  Saves the current I/O information to a Version:3 file by default
.SH Syntax \fBsaveIoFile\fR   [-help]  [-v2]  [-locations | -byOrder]  [-includeCellName]  [-only_selected_bump]  [-temp [-ioOrder {default | clockwise | counterclockwise}]]   [-relativeOrient]  fileName  
.P Saves the current I/O information to a Version:3 file by default. It also provides you the option to save the I/O information in a Version:2 file for 6.2 and earlier releases of the software. The saved file can be used to specify the I/O Assignment File in the Design Import form. This is used to save the I/O pin or pad order to a file after assigning pins or pads by loading a floorplan file or DEF data. This I/O Assignment file is rule-based, and the keyword in the I/O file is Version:3. You can use this command after floorplanning the design.
.P Note: The saveIoFile command saves the bump connect target information in the I/O file by default. 
.P Note: The saveIoFile command will write all the information of I/O pins and I/O pads if the design has both IO pins and IO pads. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each saveIoFile parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man saveIoFile  "\fB-byOrder\fR" Specifies the order of the I/O pad placement locations in the I/O file.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-includeCellName\fR" Specifies that the cell name of the I/O instance must be included in the I/O file.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-ioOrder {default | clockwise | counterclockwise}\fR" Specifies the order of placing the I/O pins in the I/O template file. You can choose one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 default: Specifies the default pin order. For a vertical edge, the default pin order is from the bottom to the top. For a horizontal edge, the default pin order is from the left of the right.  "*" 2 clockwise: Specifies the pin order in the clockwise direction.  "*" 2 counterclockwise: Specifies the pin order in the clockwise direction.
.RE   Note: For I/O cells, the saveIoFile command will write out only the default I/O order.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the pin order file to be written to.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-locations\fR" Generates an I/O file that has placement locations rather than a sequence or order of the I/O pads. Placement co-ordinates are relative to the design boundary and are not absolute locations.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, it generates an order file.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-only_selected_bump\fR" Saves only the selected bumps to the IO file. By default, saveIoFile dumps out embedded bumps to the IO file. When the -only_selected_bump option is specified, only selected bumps are dumped out and embedded bumps are ignored.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-relativeOrient\fR" Specifies an I/O orientation relative to the bottom (south) side.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-temp\fR" Performs initial I/O placement by randomly distributing the I/Os evenly. Writes out an I/O template file with evenly spaced I/O pins, after design import. Once the I/O template file is generated, you can modify the I/O file manually and reload the file in Innovus.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-v2\fR" Saves the current I/O information to a Version: 2 file for 6.2 and earlier releases of the software. If you specify this parameter for saving an I/O file consisting of rectilinear design for I/O pads, Innovus displays an error message. This is because the rectilinear design for I/O pads is supported only in the current release version of Innovus.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the I/O information is saved in a Version: 3 file.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command writes the current I/O pad and pin information to Version: 3 file:  saveIoFile myIoPlan.io   "*" 2 The following command writes the current I/O pad and pin information to a Version: 2 file and specifies the clockwise placement of the I/O pins in the I/O template file:  saveIoFile -v2 -ioOrder clockwise -template myIoPlan.io
