.SH Name \fBsetSdpTopGroup\fR \-  Specifies the location or the hierarchical path of a data path
.SH Syntax \fBsetSdpTopGroup\fR  [-help]   -group <group_name>  [-force]   {-location <llx> <lly> | -hierPath <path>} 
.P Specifies the location or the hierarchical path of a data path. If you know where SDP will be placed in the design, use the-location option to specify SDP location. The advantage of using setSdpTopGroup is that you do not need to specify the hierarchical path for each member of an SDP group.
.P Before setting setSdpTopGroup -hierPath, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Imported the design
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Created the SDP group using createSdpGroup
.RE
.P Before setting setSdpTopGroup -location, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Imported the design
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Created the SDP group using createSdpGroup
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Added members to the SDP group using addSdpGroupMember
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setSdpTopGroup parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setSdpTopGroup.  "\fB-group <group_name>\fR" Sets the specified SDP group as the SDP top group.  "\fB-force\fR" Indicates that the specified location should be set even if it is outside the existing core boundary. -force automatically adjusts the core boundary to accommodate the specified location.  "\fB-location <llx> <lly>\fR" Specifies the location of the SDP top group.  "\fB-hierPath <path>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical path of the SDP top group. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies the location of the SDP group tdsp_sdpGrp:   setSdpTopGroup -group tdsp_sdpGrp -location 848.82 586.75 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the hierarchical path for the SDP group column_GRP5 as /DTMF_INST/EXECUTE_INST. As a result, the specified instance names of all members of this SDP will have this hierarchical path.   setSdpTopGroup -group column_GRP5 -hierPath /DTMF_INST/EXECUTE_INST
