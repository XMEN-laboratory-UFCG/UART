.SH Name \fBget_power\fR \-  Queries various power related properties of design objects like nets, pins, and instances
.SH Syntax \fBget_power\fR  [-help]  [-outfile <filename>]  [-nets <nets_list>| -pins <pins_list>| -instances <instances_list>]   [-attribute <attributes_list>]   [-include_unit]   [-tcl_list ]  [-pg_net {<pg_net_name_list> | all}] 
.P Queries various power related properties of design objects like nets, pins, and instances. Using this command, you can retrieve power attributes, such as internal power, switching power, leakage power, total power, and toggle rate. This command is very useful for writing custom scripts.
.P Note: This command outputs toggle rates as N.A. if the clock domain information for a given net/pin/instance is not found.
.P Use this command after running the report_power or restore_power_database command.
.P Note: The -nets, -pins, and -instances parameters are mutually exclusive. You must specify only one of the parameters. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-attribute <attributes_list>\fR" Specifies a list of power attributes. If an attribute is not available for the specified design object, the software returns its value as NA. See attributesList of Power Attributes for a mapping of the list of available attributes with the design objects.  This is a required parameter.  "\fB-include_unit\fR" Specifies to include the units for the power attributes.  "\fB -instances <instances_list>\fR" Specifies a list of instance names. The -nets, -pins, and -instances parameters are mutually exclusive. You must specify one, and only one, of the parameters.  Note: You can use the get_cells command to determine the power attributes for a collection of instances.  "\fB-nets <nets_list>\fR" Specifies a list of net names. The -nets, -pins, and -instances parameters are mutually exclusive. You must specify one, and only one, of the parameters.  Note: You can use the get_nets command to determine the power attributes for a collection of nets.  "\fB-outfile <filename>\fR" Specifies the output file into which the power related properties are to be written.  The -tcl_list and -outfile parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  "\fB-pg_net {<pg_net_name_list> | all}\fR" Specifies to query various power-related properties of a specified power net for an instance. This parameter supports the argument all to query properties of all power nets connected to the instance.  You must use the -instances parameter in conjunction with the -pg_net parameter.  The -pg_net parameter supports the following attributes: switching_power, internal_power, leakage_power, total_power, and dynamic_power.  "\fB-pins <pins_list>\fR" Specifies a list of pin names. The -nets, -pins, and -instances parameters are mutually exclusive. You must specify one, and only one, of the parameters.  Note: You can use the get_pins command to determine the power attributes for a collection of pins.  "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Produces the report in Tcl list format instead of a tabular format.  The -tcl_list and -outfile parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.
.P The following power attributes can be queried for the design objects:
