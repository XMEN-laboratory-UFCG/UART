.SH Name \fBsetMaxTranPerFreq\fR \-  Adds a maximum transition per frequency table to the existing max_transition statement in the timing library
.SH Syntax \fBsetMaxTranPerFreq\fR   [-help]  [-lib libName]   [-force]   -freq {<freq1> <freq2 freq3>...}  -tran {<tran1> <tran2 tran3>...}   -pins {cell pin}  
.P Adds a maximum transition per frequency table to the existing max_transition statement in the timing library. Timing analysis uses this table to detect violations, and optDesign attempts to repair violations.
.P Use this command any time after loading the timing library files (that is, after importing or restoring the design).
.P The timing engine derives the frequency of an instance from the clock domain to which it is connected (the fastest clock domain, if there is more than one). If the instance is a clock instance (that is, part of the clock tree), the actual clock frequency is used. If the instance is part of the combinational logic (that is, a flip-flop, or the logic connected to the output of a flip-flop), the frequency used equals one-half of the associated clock domain frequency because a flip-flop output can only toggle at one-half the rate of the input clock. For example, a clock of 1.0 Mhz has 1,000,000 rise and fall transitions per second; however the output of a flip-flop connected to a 1.0 Mhz clock can only have 500,000 rise and fall transitions per second.
.P Timing analysis computes the frequency directly from the timing graph. Use the dbSetNetFrequency command to write the effective frequency onto the associated net in the database. Use the dbNetFrequency database command to check any given net's frequency value. The frequency values are stored in Hertz in the database. Modifying this value with the dbSetNetFrequency database command only affects verifyACLimit.
.P Note: This command supports MMMC and performs DRV computation as per view frequency. This feature is enabled by setting the below global variable to true.
.P set_global timing_report_drv_enable_frequency_per_view true
.P For detailed description of the variable, see the Timing Global Variables chapter. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setMaxTranPerFreq parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use man setMaxTranPerFreq.  "\fB-force\fR" Computes the maximum transition from the interpolated -freq and -tran values only and ignores any previously defined max_transition values for these pins in the library.  Default: Uses the worst case (minimum value) between the
.lib max_transition values and the interpolated -tran values.  "\fB-freq {<freq1><freq2 freq3>...}\fR" Specifies a list of at least two frequency values that must be greater than or equal to 0. You must specify the same number of -freq and -tran values, and the frequency values must be specified in ascending order.  Type: Float, specified in units of Hz  "\fB-lib <libName>\fR" Modifies only the matching cell-pins in the specified library.  Default: Modifies the matching cell-pins in all libraries.  "\fB-pins {<cell> <pin>}\fR" Adds the new transition constraints to the specified set of cells and pins. You can specify input, output, or inout pins. The asterisk (*) wildcard character can be used in a cell or pin name. If a table associated with the pin already exists, it is replaced with the new table.  For analysis and optimization, the software uses the most restrictive (the lowest transition) value from either the table or the
.lib max_transition. If you also specify the -force parameter, the max_transition value is ignored. The final value can be further modified using
.sdc set_max_transition statements.  "\fB-tran {<tran1><tran2 tran3>...}\fR" Specifies a list of transition values that must be greater than or equal to 0. You must specify the same number of -freq and -tran values.  The software derives the maximum transition limit from a linear interpolation (or extrapolation) for a given frequency value using two frequency values in the table. For interpolation, the software uses the closest value above the frequency, and the closest value below the frequency. For extrapolation, the software uses the two closest values to the frequency.  Type: Float, specified in units of ns 
.SH Examples
.P Assume all output pins of a library have a max_transition value of 0.9 ns from the library file.
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the frequency dependent max_transition to 1.0 ns at a frequency of 100 Mhz, and to 0.7 ns at a frequency of 200 Mhz, for pins matching in* of cells matching * (that is, all cells) in the library named slow:   setMaxTranPerFreq -lib slow -freq {100e6 200e6} -tran {1.0 0.7} -pins {* in*}   As a result, at 300 Mhz, an and2 cell input pin named in1 has an extrapolated max_transition value of 0.4ns. An extrapolation to 50 Mhz results in a max_transition value of 1.15 ns. However, the 1.15 ns value is greater than the existing
.libmax_transition value of 0.9 ns; therefore timing analysis uses the 0.9 value.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command applies the same constraints to all libraries with cell names matching dff* that have a pin named clk:   setMaxTranPerFreq -force -freq {100e6 200e6} -tran {1.0 0.7} -pins {dff* clk}  Note: The original
.libmax_transition value is ignored because the -force parameter is specified; therefore an extrapolation to 50 Mhz results in a final max_transition limit of 1.15 ns.
