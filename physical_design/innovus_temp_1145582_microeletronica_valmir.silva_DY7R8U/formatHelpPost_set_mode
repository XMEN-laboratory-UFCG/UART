.TH set_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_mode\fR \-  Specifies the Liberty timing library modes to be active for a specific instance
.SH Syntax \fBset_mode\fR  [-type cell]   <list_of_modes>  <object_list> 
.P Specifies the Liberty timing library modes to be active for a specific instance.
.P A library mode is a subset of active timing arcs that is defined in the timing library. Library modes are similar to conditional timing arcs, but do not require the application of constants to set. Instead of changing a cell's mode by applying constants to its input pins, you can use the set_mode command to refer to sets of active arcs by name (such as READ or WRITE, for a memory cell).
.P By default, all library modes in the timing library are active. If you specify one or more library modes using the set_mode command, only the timing arcs consistent with the specified mode(s) are active for the instance. All other library modes become inactive.
.P To reset the library modes for an instance, use the reset_mode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the instances to which to apply the library mode.  "\fB<list_of_modes>\fR" Specifies the name of the library mode value defined in the timing library. You can specify one or more mode values, but only one mode value per defined mode group in the Liberty library.  "\fB-type cell\fR" Sets the library mode at the instance level.  Note: Setting the library mode at the instance level is the only form of set_mode that is currently supported. This parameter exists to support constraints coming from external sources. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies the test_mode library mode active for instances of b1.  set_mode test_mode [get_cells b1]  The following command reports the status of all library modes associated with b1:   tempus > report_mode b1   -------------------------------   Mode Group test_mode of b1   -------------------------------   Mode     Status     Condition   Name   -------------------------------   test_B   Inactive   !(Y)   test_A   ACTIVE      Y  -------------------------------  The above report shows that only the timing arcs consistent with the test_A library mode are active for instances of b1 - and test_B is inactive.  "*" 2  If you specify the report_inactive_arcs command, the report shows the disabled arcs for the b1 instance are from the test_mode library mode:  ----------------------------------------------------  Flags :  const propagated constant           snipped loop snipped arcs           disable set_disable_timing           disable_clock_gating set_disable_clock_gating           library_disable set_disable_cell_timing           Missing_Phase No Arc Phase Data  From     To       DisableType   ArcType                 Reason   -----------------------------------------------------------------  u8/CK ^   u8/D ^   const        hold_rising_clk_rise    u8/D = 1  u8/CK ^   u8/D v   const        hold_falling_clk_rise   u8/D = 1  u8/CK ^   u8/D ^   const        setup_rising_clk_rise   u8/D = 1  u8/CK ^   u8/D v   const        setup_falling_clk_rise  u8/D = 1  -----------------------------------------------------------------
