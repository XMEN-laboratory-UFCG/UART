.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each set_power_rail_layers_nets parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man set_power_rail_layers_nets.  "\fB           -design_opacity <value>\fR" Specifies the design opacity value for the design database.  The opacity range is from 0-100%, the default value is 60.  "\fB-disable_nets {<names>}\fR" Hides the specified nets. This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -enable_nets and  -nets parameters.   "\fB-disable_report_layers {all|<layer_names>}\fR" Hides the reporting (user-defined layers to be used for processing) of layers. You can use all to hide all layers, or list the specific layers that are not to be displayed.  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -enable_report_layers and -layers parameters.  "\fB-disable_switch_nets {all|<net_names>}\fR" Hides the specified switch nets. You can use all to hide all the switch nets, or list the specific switch nets that are not to be displayed. This parameter is mutually exclusive to the  -enable_switch_nets parameter.   "\fB-disable_visible_layers {all|<layer_names>}\fR" Specifies which layers should not be made visible when plotting. You can use all to hide all layers, or list the specific layers that are not to be displayed.  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -enable_visible_layers and -layers parameters.  "\fB-disable_visible_sem_layers {all|<layer_names>}\fR" Specifies which signal EM layers should not be made visible when plotting. You can use all to hide all layers, or list the specific layers that are not to be displayed.  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -enable_visible_sem_layers parameter.  "\fB-enable_nets {<names>}\fR" Displays only the specified nets. This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -disable_nets and  -nets parameters.   "\fB-enable_report_layers {all|<layer_names>}\fR" Specifies to select the user-defined layers to be used for processing. You can use all to select all layers, or list the specific layers that are to be selected.  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -disable_report_layers and -layers parameters.  "\fB-enable_switch_nets {all|<net_names>}\fR" Displays the specified switch nets. You can use all to display all the switch nets, or list the specific switch nets that are to be displayed. This parameter is mutually exclusive to the  -disable_switch_nets  parameter.   "\fB-enable_visible_layers {all|<layer_names>}\fR" Specifies which layers should be made visible when plotting. You can use all to display all layers, or list the specific layers that are to be made visible.  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -disable_visible_layers and -layers parameters.  "\fB-enable_visible_sem_layers {all|<layer_names>}\fR" Specifies which signal EM layers should be made visible when plotting. You can use all to select all layers, or list the specific layers that are to be selected.  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -disable_visible_sem_layers parameter.  "\fB-instance_voltage_method {Worst | Best | Avg | WorstAvg}\fR" Allows different methods of computing effective instance voltage during rail analysis. Using this option, you can write out the Best, Worst, or Average effective instance voltage between power and ground nets.  The WorstAvg method computes the average instance voltage during each evaluation window defined by the IV Window field, and reports the worst average instance voltage out of all the windows. If IV Method is WorstAvg and IV Window is whole, then this method will report average voltage across all time steps in simulation.  Default : Worst  "\fB-instance_voltage_window {1| 0}  \fR" Controls the EIV plot. EIV is obtained by processing the voltage waveforms and finding the worse-case effective voltage between the power and ground pins during a specific window.  There are two options to view EIV plots:
.RS  "*" 2 1 - both switching and timing windows (window EIV)  "*" 2 0 - worst of the entire rail simulation (worst EIV)
.RE   "\fB-layers {{name report0/1 visible0/1}{...}}\fR" Controls the visibility of layers. You can enable or disable the reporting and visibility of specific layer. For example, -layer {{M1 1 1} {M2 0 0} means enable reporting and visibility of layer M1, and disable reporting and visibility of layer M2  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -disable_report_layers, -disable_visible_layers, -enable_visible_layers, and -enable_report_layers parameters.  "\fB-nets {{all_power 0/1}{all_ground 0/1}}\fR" Controls the display of all the power and ground nets.   When all_power is set to 0, hides all power nets, and when set to 1, displays all power nets. When all_ground is set to 0, hides all ground nets, and when set to 1, displays all ground nets.  This parameter is mutually exclusive to the -enable_nets and -disable_nets parameters.  "\fB-rail_analysis_opacity <value>\fR" Specifies the opacity value for the rail analysis output.  The opacity range is from 0-100%, the default value is 100.  "\fB-show_layer_net_setting_list {true | false}\fR" Displays the current status (OFF/ON) of all layers and nets in the console. The following is an example of the output:  #-------------------------------#  # Layers   Report    Visible #  # RD        ON         ON #  # M0        ON         ON # 
.....  #-------------------------------## PowerNets  Status #   # VDD          ON #   # VDDm         ON #   #-------------------------------#   # GroundNets Status #    # VSS         ON #   #-------------------------------#  "\fB-via_size {1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6}\fR" Specifies to modify and control the size of vias in the GUI. The default via size is 1. The possible via size values are  1,  2,  3,  4,  5, and  6. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies the layers that will be visible:   set_power_rail_layers_nets \\    -enable_visible_layers{RD M1 V12 M2 V23 M3 V34 M4 V45 M5 V56 M6} \\   -enable_nets {vdd vdd_1}  "*" 2  The following commands describe the use model for enabling and disabling switch nets. Here, consider a net VDD with three switch nets VDD_sw0, VDD_sw1, and VDD_sw2:
.RS  "*" 2 The following command hides the switch net VDD_sw0:  set_power_rail_layers_net -disable_switch_nets {VDD {VDD_sw0}}  Displays VDD_sw1 and VDD_sw2.  "*" 2 The following command hides all the switch nets:  set_power_rail_layers_net -disable_switch_nets {VDD {all}}  "*" 2 The following command displays the switch net VDD_sw0:  set_power_rail_layers_net -enable_switch_nets {VDD {VDD_sw0}}  "*" 2 The following command displays all the switch nets:  set_power_rail_layers_net -enable_switch_nets {VDD {all}}
