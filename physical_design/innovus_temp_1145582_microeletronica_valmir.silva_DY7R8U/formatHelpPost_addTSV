.P Adds TSVs, front-side bumps, and backside bumps under specified conditions. Use this command to create TSVs and bumps after the initial floorplan is loaded. It also checks dummy bump overlaps by default. It checks overlaps between:
.RS  "*" 2 Dummy bumps by checking the OBS overlap.  "*" 2 Dummy bump and bump by checking the OBS and bump pin overlap.
.RE
.P In case there is dummy bump overlaps, the tool gives a warning message. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-tsvViaName <viaName>\fR" Specifies the name for TSV via defined in the LEF file. If this option is not specified, no TSV will be created.  The following arguments are used only with tsvViaName:
.RS  "*" 2 noPlaceBlkg  "*" 2 spacing  "*" 2 tsvFeedthru  "*" 2 stackViaTopLayer  "*" 2 stripeNet  "*" 2 stripeLayer
.RE   "\fB-frontBump<bumpCellName>\fR" Specifies the name for the front-side bump cell. If this option is not specified, no front-side bump will be created.  "\fB-backBump <bumpCellName>\fR" Specifies the name for the backside bump cell. If this option is not specified, no backside bump will be created.  "\fB-loc_type {geometry_center|cell_center}        \fR" Specifies the location type for bump creation.
.RS  "*" 2 geometry_center: Specifies to use bump pin geometry to create bump  "*" 2 cell_center: Specifies to use bump bounding box to create bump
.RE   This option is used with the -frontBump and -backBump options.  "\fB-lowerLeftLoc x y\fR" Specifies (in microns) the lower left coordinate of the box in which TSV/Bumps will be created.  "\fB-numxy x y\fR" Specifies (in microns) the count of the TSV/bump in the horizontal and vertical direction.  "\fB-perim <n>\fR" Creates TSV, front-side bumps, and backside bumps along the rings on the perimeter.  If -perim is specified, <n>defines the number of rings. Then you can create TSV in the following ways:
.RS  "*" 2 Define the lower left and upper right location of the ring by -lowerLeftLoc and -upperRightLoc, and then the pitch value of x and y direction by -pitchxy. For example, the following command creates TSV in which the lower-left is at {x1 y1} and the upper-right is at {x2 y2}  addTSV -lowerLeftLoc {x1 y1} -upperRightLoc {x2 y2} -pitchxy {px py} -stagger -perim 1                   *********                   *       *                   *       *                   *       *                   *       *                   *********   "*" 2 Define the lower left location of the ring by -lowerLeftLoc, and then specify the number and pitch value of tsv in x and y directions by -numxy and -pitchxy, respectively. For example, the following command creates TSV in which the lower left is at {x1 y1}  -lowerLeftLoc {x1 y1} -numxy {12 8} -pitchxy {px py} -perim 2                   ************                   ************                   **        **                   **        **                   **        **                   **        **                   ************                   ************
.RE   "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Adds a prefix name for a bump during bump creation and bump mapping. The prefix name is not added to the TSV.   "\fB-relative_bump_cell <bumpCell>\fR" Creates TSV or bumps by default at the geometry center of bumps with specified bump cell.   "\fB-relative_bump_type {signal power ground}\fR" Creates the relative bump type, TSV, or bumps by default at the geometry center of bumps with the specified bump type.  "\fB-relative_min_pitch <minPitch>\fR" Specifies the minimum pitch between the created bumps/TSVs. The pitch between all the created bumps/TSV should be larger than specified min pitch. The -relative_min_pitch option is optional and can be used only if -relative_bump_cell/-relative_selected_bump is specified.  "\fB-relative_offset {x y}\fR" Specifies the offset of created bump/TSV location compared with the relative bump. The geometry center of the created bump/TSV is the geometry center of the relative bumps plus the offset.  -relative_offset is optional and can be used only if -relative_bump_cell/-relative_selected_bump is specified.  "\fB-relative_selected_bump\fR" Creates TSV or bumps by default at the geometry center of the selected bumps.   "\fB-upperRightLoc x y\fR" Specifies (in microns) the upper right coordinate of the box in which TSV/Bumps will be created.  "\fB-pitchxy <x y>\fR" Specifies (in microns) the distance between TSV centers in the x and y direction.  "\fB-stagger \fR" Staggers (offsets) the TSV/bump array. For example:  without -stagger       with -stagger   * * * * *             * * * * *   * * * * *              * * * *   * * * * *             * * * * *   * * * * *              * * * *  * * * * *            * * * * *   "\fB-noPlaceBlkg\fR" The placement blockage overlapped with TSV cut will be added as default if -noPlaceBlkg is not specified.  "\fB-noRouteBlkg\fR" The routing blockage for each crossing layer will be added if -noRouteBlkg is not specified.   "\fB-tsvFeedthru <sizex sizey>\fR" Creates the feedthru. sizeX and sizeY are the dimensions, in microns, for the stack vias aligned with the TSV.  Note: Feedtrhu is a collection of components including TSV, the stacked via (from the first metal to the top metal) aligned with the TSV, and two bumps on the frontside and backside.  "\fB-stackViaMarkerLayer <markerLayerName(s)>\fR" Specifies the mark layer name. Mark cut layer of stack via as specified mark layer.  If cut layers of stack via cell are different, you can use [-stackViaMarkerLayer {markLayerName1 markLayerName2}] to define different mark layers.  "\fB-stackViaName <stackViaName>\fR" Specifies the stack via cell name. The tool automatically adds the specified via cell stacking to the top layer of long TSV.  You can add TSV stack vias on both the front-side and back-side layers using -stackViaName {<stackViaName1 stackViaName2>}  "\fB-stackViaTopLayer <layer>  \fR" Defines the top layer that the TSV structure should connect to. For example, if you specify M5 for this parameter, Innovus will create a structure like TSV+VIA12+M2+VIA23+M3+.....+M5. This parameter must be used with  -tsvFeedthru.   "\fB-stackViaUnderBump <stackViaName>\fR" Specifies the stack via name under the front bump.  The tool automatically adds the specified via cell stacking to the bottom layer of front-side bump.  "\fB-stripeNet <pgnetName>\fR" Declares that the TSV will be added beneath the power stripe, a stack via will be generated to touch the power stripe, and the new added TSV will be assigned by the power or ground net of the power stripe.  Note: This options should be used along with the -stripeLayer option.  "\fB-stack_via_array {x y}\fR" Specifies the number of columns and rows for the stack via array.  The -stack_via_array and -stack_via_pitch options can only be specified when  -stackViaName is specified. -stack_via_array and -stack_via_pitch are specified at the same time. The value of -stack_via_pitch should be larger than stack via size. Otherwise, the stack via will overlap each other and cause DRC.  You can also define different arrays when you add TSV stack via on both the frontside and backside layers with -stack_via_array {{x1 y1} {x2 y2}}. If there are two stack vias and only one needs to be defined, use -stack_via_array {{x1 y1} {1 1}}.  "\fB-stack_via_pitch {x y}\fR" Specifies the pitch_x and pitch_y of the stack via.  The -stack_via_array and -stack_via_pitch options can only be specified when  -stackViaName is specified. -stack_via_array and -stack_via_pitch are specified at the same time. The value of -stack_via_pitch should be larger than stack via size. Otherwise, the stack via will overlap each other and cause DRC.  You can also define different pitches when you add TSV stack via on both the frontside and backside layers with -stack_via_pitch {{x1 y1} {x2 y2}}.  "\fB-stripeLayer <layerNum>\fR" Specifies the layer number or layer name for the stripe net when adding TSV under stripe net.  Note: This option should be used along with -stripeNet option.  "\fB-spacing s\fR" Specifies the placement blockage size. Blockage size = TSV cut size + 2*s. If this option is not specified, "s" will be with the value defined in LAYER TSV session in LEF file.   Note:  At least one option of the following arguments is required for the addTSV command:
.RS  "*" 2 tsvViaName  "*" 2 frontBump  "*" 2 backBump
