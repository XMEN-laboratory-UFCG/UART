.SH Name \fBplaceInstance\fR \-  Places a leaf instance in the core box.  Instance is snapped to the site whose lower left corner is nearest to the location specified.  If the location specified is outside of the core box, then the instance is snapped to site whose lower left corner is nearest to the location specified
.SH Syntax \fBplaceInstance\fR  [-help]  instance_name  <location>   [<orientation>]  [{-fixed | -placed | -softFixed}] 
.P Places a leaf instance in the core box.  Instance is snapped to the site whose lower left corner is nearest to the location specified.  If the location specified is outside of the core box, then the instance is snapped to site whose lower left corner is nearest to the location specified. Instance is not checked for legality-it can overlap other boxes, either placed or fixed, and it can be placed within placement blockages. If no orientation is specified, or if an illegal orientation is specified, placeInstance will orient the instance with the default orientation of the site in which the instance is being placed. You can check the legality of the placed instance by the checkPlace command.
.P Note: If you place a master instance blackbox to non-R0 orientation, the new non-R0 orientation will be converted to R0 orientation.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each placeInstance parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man placeInstance.  "\fBinstance_name\fR" Specifies the leaf instance name.  "\fB<location>\fR" Specifies x and y coordinates of new origin.
.RS  "*" 2 x: Specifies the lower-left x coordinate of the instance on the x axis.  "*" 2 y: Specifies the lower-left y coordinate of the instance on the y axis.
.RE   "\fB<orientation>\fR" Specifies the orientation of the instance. Specify one of the following values: R0, R90, R180, R270, MX, MX90, MY, or MY90.  <Default>: R0   "\fB-fixed | -placed | -softFixed\fR" Specifies that the cell being placed is in the fixed, placed, or softFixed status.  <Default>: -fixed 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places the instance SH22/I40 with mirrored through Y axis orientation at location 1500.3, 980.3 in the floorplan. The instance SH22/I40 is fixed by default and the placement program will not move this instance later:   placeInstance SH22/I40 1500.3 980.3 MY
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places the instance SH22/I51 with default R0 orientation at location 398.7, 1480.2 in the floorplan. The instance SH22/I52 has 'placed' status and it can be moved during optimization, clock synthesis, or refinePlace:   placeInstance SH22/I51 398.7 1480.2 -placed
