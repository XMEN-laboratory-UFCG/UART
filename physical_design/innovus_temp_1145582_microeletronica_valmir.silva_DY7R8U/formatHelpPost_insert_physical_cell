.SH Name \fBinsert_physical_cell\fR \-  Provides a flexible way to insert and check physical cells
.SH Syntax \fBinsert_physical_cell\fR   [-help]   [-cell <string>]   [-genTemplateOnly <string>]   [-inputFile <filename>]  [-insertRowAreaBoundary]   [-averageWindow | { [-insertNearBoundary ] [-box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}] [-minimalNumberOfTCD <integer>]}]   [-verifyWindow {<x y>}[ [-verifyOnly ][-xStep <float>] [-yStep <float>] ] ]
.P Provides a flexible way to insert and check physical cells. It can be used to assign a specific area for physical insertion, not only the die area. 
.P Note: The insert_physical_cell command is suitable for inserting physical cells as a pattern. The class of these cells must be block and not core. The insert_physical_cell command is not when the class of the physical cells is core and there is no requirement for inserting cells in a pattern.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB-averageWindow\fR" When specified, it changes the window calculation approach to average. The size of windows for inserting cell is the average of the core box. The insertion will be done not exactly in accordance with the size defined in spec file.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specify the bounding box of the physical cell in <x1 y1 x2 y2>.  For example, the following command inserts the cell DTCDCELL in the (x1 y1 x2 y2) box.  insert_physical_cell -cell DTCDCELL -inputFile SPECFILE -box {x1 y1 x2 y2}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-cell <string>\fR" Specify the physical cell name(s).  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-genTemplateOnly <string>\fR" Generates a template file to guide how to define spec file for DTCD, ICOVL and LinerCell.   Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each insert_physical_cell parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man insert_physical_cell  "\fB-inputFile <filename>\fR" Specify the spec file for physical cells.   Note: The inserted physical cells must be specified in a spec file. This file specifies the information related to the dimensions and spacing physical cells. The tool will insert physical cells according to these specifications.  Here is an example of a spec file:  *************************  DTCD Cell cell_name  WinSizeX          # x dimension of DTCD insertion grid box  WinSizeY          # y dimension of DTCD insertion grid box  MacroSpacing      # spacing between DTCD cell and macro  DTCDSpacing       # spacing between DTCD cells  PlaceBlockSizeX   # x dimension of padded placement blockage around DTCD cell  PlaceBlockSizeY   # y dimension of padded placement blockage around DTCD cell  RouteBlockSizeX   # x dimension of padded routing blockage around DTCD cell  RouteBlockSizeY   # y dimension of padded routing blockage around DTCD cell  End  *************************  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-insertNearBoundary\fR" Inserts physical cells near boundary.  Note: When the window size is not exactly divided by gridbox size, you may not get physical cells near boundary.  For example:  insert_physical_cell -cell DTCDCELL -inputFile SPECFILE  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   insert_physical_cell -cell DTCDcell -inputFile SPECFILE -insertNearBoundary  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-insertRowAreaBoundary\fR" Inserts LinerCell around row area boundary.   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-minimalNumberOfTCD <integer>\fR" Specifies the the minimal number of DTCD that must be inserted. If the current windows size definition (WinSizeX and WinSizeY) cannot fit this requirement, the window size is shrunk automatically.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-verifyOnly\fR" Only verifies the physical cells to inserted. It does not actually insert them.   Note: The -verifyWindow, -xStep, and -yStep parameters are used to specify the size of the window to verify.  For example:  insert_physical_cell -cell DTCDCELL -inputFile SPECFILE -verifyWindow 100 100 -xStep 100 -yStep 100 -verifyOnly  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)    insert_physical_cell -cell DTCDCELL -inputFile SPECFILE -verifyWindow 100 100 -xStep 100 -yStep 100  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-verifyWindow {<x y>}\fR" Specifies the size of window for verifying the physical cells to be inserted.  Data_type: point, optional  "\fB-xStep <float>\fR" Specifies the x step of the verify window.   Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-yStep <float>\fR" Specifies the y step of the verify window.   Data_type: float, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command inserts the cell DTCDCELL in the (x1 y1 x2 y2) box based on the spec specified in the SPECFILE.  insert_physical_cell -cell DTCDCELL -inputFile SPECFILE -box {x1 y1 x2 y2}   "*" 2 The following command only verifies the cell DTCDCELL in the grid box. It does not insert the cell.  insert_physical_cell -cell DTCDCELL -inputFile SPECFILE -verifyWindow 100 100 -xStep 100 -yStep 100 -verifyOnly
