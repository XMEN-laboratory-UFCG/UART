.SH Name \fBcreatePinBlkg\fR \-  Creates a pin blockage for a module
.SH Syntax \fBcreatePinBlkg\fR  [-help] [-cell  <cell_name>] [-layer {<layer_id_list>}]   { -area <{x1 y1 x2 y2>} | [-edge <edge_number> [[-offset_start <distance>] [-offset_end <distance>]]] |   [-abutted_master_clone_channel_access_only [-feedthru_blockage_file <file_name>]] }   [ -name <blockage_name> [ -includePinPatterns {<pin_name_pattern_list>} | -excludePinPatterns {<pin_name_pattern_list>} ]] 
.P Creates a pin blockage for a module. You can run this command on the top-level module also. You can use this command during partition floorplanning. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-abutted_master_clone_channel_access_only\fR" Creates pin blockages on abutted edges of master-clones that abut to its parent or other master-clones.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-area <x1 y1 x2 y2>\fR" Specifies the lower left x coordinate, lower left y coordinate, upper right x coordinate, and upper right y coordinate respectively of the blockage area.  Note: The values of x1, y1, x2, and y2 are relative to the top-level coordinates.  Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-cell <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the module for which the pin blockage will be created. 
.RS  "*" 2 If -cell option is not used, then the blockage applies to top-level pins only.  "*" 2 If -cell option is used, then only, the Partition/Blackbox pins will be considered.
.RE   Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-edge <edge_number>\fR" Specifies the integer value where edge numbering starts from lower-left corner of a partition clock-wise. Edge 0 is the edge that has the smallest y value.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-excludePinPatterns {<pin_name_pattern_list>}\fR" Specifies the pin-list on which the pin-blockage is not applicable. Pins which are specified in this list can be placed in this area legally.   Note: The -excludePinPatterns and -includePinPatterns options are mutually exclusive and cannot be used in a single command. Both these options require the use of the -name option to specify the name of the partition pin blockage.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-feedthru_blockage_file <file_name>\fR" Outputs a file with coordinates of blocked edges for pin assignment transformed into feedthru blockage_file format.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createPinBlkg parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man createPinBlkg  "\fB-includePinPatterns {<pin_name_pattern_list>}\fR" Specifies the pin-list on which the pin-blockage is applicable. All other pins can be placed in this area legally.   Note: The -excludePinPatterns and -includePinPatterns options are mutually exclusive and cannot be used in a single command. Both these options require the use of the -name option to specify the name of the partition pin blockage.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-layer {<layer_id_list>}\fR" Specifies the metal layer(s) for which pins are not to be created.  Note: Layers can be specified using the LEF layer names or layer ID numbers.  Default: If no layer number is specified, all metal layers are blocked.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-name <blockage_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the partition pin blockage.  Default: By default, the name is defPtnPinBlkName.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-offset_end <distance>\fR" Specifies the distance, in microns, from the ending corner of the edge.   Minimum  Value: 0  Maximum Value: 65535  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-offset_start <distance>\fR" Specifies the distance, in microns, from the starting corner of the edge.  Minimum  Value: 0  Maximum Value: 65535  Data_type: float, optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a pin blockage named pinBlkg1 on the edge 0 of layers Metal5 and Metal7 for the module PtnBlock1.   createPinBlkg -edge 0 -name pinBlkg1 -cell PtnBlock1 -layer {Metal5 Metal7}

.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a pin blockage named pinBlkg2 on layers Metal5 and Metal7 for the module PtnBlock2. The blockage area is bounded by the lower-left coordinates 100, 200 and the upper-right coordinates 300, 400.   createPinBlkg -area 100 200 300 400 -name pinBlkg2 -cell PtnBlock2 -layer {Metal5 Metal7}  "*" 2  The following command creates a pin blockage named pinBlkg3 that only applies to partition pins that match pattern1 and pattern2. All other partition pins can be placed in this area legally.  createPinBlkg -includePinPatterns {*pattern1* *pattern2*} -cell PtnBlock3 -area $area -name pinBlkg3  "*" 2 The following command creates a pin blockage named pinBlkg4 that only applies to all partition pins except those that match pattern1 and pattern2. Only pins that match pattern1 and pattern2 can be placed at this edge legally.  createPinBlkg -excludePinPatterns {*pattern1* *pattern2*} -cell PtnBlock4 -edge 0 -name pinBlkg4
