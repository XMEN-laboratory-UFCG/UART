.TH write_text_timing_report  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBwrite_text_timing_report\fR \-  Writes a text file containing information about paths that have been loaded from a
.mtarpt file from Timing Debug, either with the load_timing_debug_report command or in the Display/Generate Timing Report form in the GUI
.SH Syntax \fBwrite_text_timing_report\fR  [-help]  [-mtarpt file.mtarpt | -category category_name]   [-format{{<column1 width1>} {<column2 width2>}
...}]  [-path_specification <path_specification>]  [-summary]  -report <file.tarpt> 
.P Writes a text file containing information about paths that have been loaded from a
.mtarpt file from Timing Debug, either with the load_timing_debug_report command or in the Display/Generate Timing Report form in the GUI.
.P Paths are selected as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 If only one
.mtarpt file is loaded and no other parameters are specified, then the tool writes all the paths contained in the loaded
.mtarpt file.  "*" 2 If there are several
.mtarpt files loaded, you must specify the
.mtarpt file from which the tool can select the paths, except if a category is specified.
.RE
.P You can use this report for performing timing analysis.
.P If only one machine-readable report file is loaded, then the tool writes all paths from that file into the output report. If more than one file is loaded, then the tools issues an error message.
.P Note: The generated report cannot be read back into the timing debug environment. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each write_text_timing_report parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man write_text_timing_report  "\fB-category <category_name>\fR" Specifies the category of paths to write to the text file. You cannot specify -mtarpt if you specify this parameter.  "\fB-format{{<column1> <width1>} {<column2> <width2>}
...}\fR" Formats the report according to the specified column name and its width. The column-width pair specifies the column to display in the report and the width of that column. Multiple column names can be specified.  Default: {{name 35} {arc 10} {cell 10} {delay 10} {slew 10} {load 10} {arrival 10} {required 10}}  Available column list values are: name arc cell delay slew load arrival required stolen fanout fedge tedge incr_delay type fpin_loc tpin_loc loc pin sum status ir_drop wire_len  "\fB-mtarpt <file.mtarpt>\fR" Specifies the name of the
.mtarpt file to read and convert to a text file. You cannot specify this parameter if you specify -category.  "\fB-path_specification <path_specification>\fR" Writes a single number or path range separated by blank space. A path range is two numbers separated by a minus "-" sign. You can use this parameter only if a single file is specified or loaded.  "\fB-report <file.tarpt>\fR" Specifies the name of the text output file.  "\fB-summary                        \fR" Writes each path file header (endpoint name and slack) only. Use this parameter if you do not need a detailed table. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command loads machine-readable report top.mtarpt:   load_timing_debug_report top.mtarpt
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reads the top.mtarpt report and reports paths 1 through 50 in the top_tarpt.txt file.   write_text_timing_report -mtarpt top.mtarpt -path_specification {1-50} -report top_tarpt.txt
