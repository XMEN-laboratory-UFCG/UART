.SH Name \fBtiming_propagate_latch_data_uncertainty\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_propagate_latch_data_uncertainty\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P When set to true, uses the clock phase associated with a flush latch's data pin as the "from" clock phase for downstream uncertainty timing calculations
.P When set to false, the downstream uncertainty calculations are based on the clock phase of the flush latch's clock signal.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
