.SH Name \fBreclaimArea\fR \-  Creates space in the design by downsizing and deleting buffers, without worsening the slack or increasing the design rule violations
.SH Syntax  \fBreclaimArea\fR   [-help]   [-noDeclone]  [-noDeleteBuffer]    [-noDownsize]   [-maintainHold]
.P Creates space in the design by downsizing and deleting buffers, without worsening the slack or increasing the design rule violations.
.P Note: Cadence recommends using the optDesigncommand to correct timing violations during timing optimization instead of using this command. For information on using      optDesign, see Optimizing Timing in the Innovus User Guide. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each  reclaimArea parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man reclaimArea  "\fB-noDeclone\fR" Stops Innovus from decloning instances to reclaim area. By default, the software declones instances to reclaim area.   "\fB-noDeleteBuffer\fR" Prohibits Innovus from deleting buffers to reclaim area.   Default: The software deletes buffers to reclaim area.  "\fB-noDownsize\fR" Prohibits Innovus from downsizing instances to reclaim area.   Default: The software downsizes instances to reclaim area.  "\fB-maintainHold\fR" Runs the hold aware area reclaim. This is only supported after the design has been routed. 
.SH Example
.P By default area reduction is happening only on positive slack instances. To allow the tool to reclaim area on instances that have a negative slack, you can set a negative setup target slack:
.P setOptMode -opt_setup_target_slack <current_negative_slack>  reclaimArea
