.SH Name \fBmodifyBudget\fR \-  Modifies budgets after they have been saved using the saveTimingBudget command
.SH Syntax \fBmodifyBudget\fR   {-ptn <partitionName> | -inst <instanceName>}  -file <fileName>  [-setup | -hold]   [-view <viewName>]  [-help]  
.P Modifies budgets after they have been saved using the saveTimingBudget command. To modify budgets, you must create an input budget file containing constraints that look like an SDC file. It only supports set_input_delay and set_output_delay constraints. The clock names in these constraints are same as the ones in the generated budget file. You can provide a bus name instead of a pin name to apply the same budget to all pins of the bus.
.P To use modifyBudget, you must specify the following command before deriveTimingBudget:
.P setBudgetingMode -reportOrModifyBudget true 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each modifyBudget parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man modifyBudget   "\fB-file <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the input budget file containing manual budgets.  "\fB-hold\fR" Specifies to modify the hold information.  "\fB-inst <instanceName>\fR" Specifies the name of the hierarchical instance for which manual budgets are to be applied.  "\fB-ptn <partitionName>\fR" Specifies the name of the partition for which manual budgets are to be applied.  "\fB-setup\fR" Specifies to modify the setup information.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Modifies the budget for the specified view. If you derived the timing budget in MMMC mode (default), this parameter is required to modify the budget. 
.SH Example
.P The following command modifies the budget data for the instance inst1:   modifyBudget -inst inst1 -file mod_inst
