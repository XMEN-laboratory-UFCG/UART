.SH Name \fBgui_select\fR \-  Selects objects as per the parameters you specify
.SH Syntax \fBgui_select\fR   [-help]   {-point {x y} |   -line {x1 y1 x2 y2} |   -rect {x1 y1 x2 y2}}   [-toggle  | -append  | -next]   [-point {x y} [-next ]] 
.P Selects objects as per the parameters you specify. Use -point to select the object at the specified coordinate, -line to select the objects through which the specified line passes, or -rect to select the objects falling within the specified box coordinates. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each gui_select parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man gui_select   "\fB-append\fR" Appends to the existing selection. This is equivalent to pressing the Shift key while selecting an object using the GUI.   "\fB-line {x1 y1 x2 y2}\fR" Selects by line. Use this parameter to select the objects through which the specified line passes.   "\fB-next\fR" Steps to next object under point. This is same as using space bar while selecting an object using the GUI.   "\fB-point {x y}\fR" Selects the object at the specified point.   "\fB-rect {x1 y1 x2 y2}\fR" Selects by box. Use this parameter to select the objects falling within the specified rectangular area.   "\fB-toggle\fR" Toggles the selection. This is equivalent to pressing the Ctrl key while selecting an object using the GUI.
