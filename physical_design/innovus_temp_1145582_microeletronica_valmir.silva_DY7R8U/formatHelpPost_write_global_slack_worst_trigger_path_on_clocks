.SH Name \fBwrite_global_slack_worst_trigger_path_on_clocks\fR
.SH Syntax \fBwrite_global_slack_worst_trigger_path_on_clocks\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Specifies whether the write_global_slack_report command reports worst slack on the register clock pins or not. When set to true, the write_global_slack_report command reports worst slack due to triggering paths.
.P A CLK pin might drive a Q pin of the same register, and have a setup or hold check arc with respect to the D pin. In the default setting, when the global is set to false, the write_global_slack_report command reports no slacks along the clock paths. When the global is set to true, the command will report the worst slack on register clock pins due to the related trigger paths and not due to the related timing checks.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
