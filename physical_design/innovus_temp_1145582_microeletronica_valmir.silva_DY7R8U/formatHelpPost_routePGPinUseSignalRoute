.SH Name \fBroutePGPinUseSignalRoute\fR \-  Routes the secondary power/ground pins of always-on cells to the specified power/ground nets in signal route
.SH Syntax \fBroutePGPinUseSignalRoute\fR  [help]  [-all]  [-maxFanout number]  [-nets {listofNets}]  [-nonDefaultRule ruleName]   [-pattern {trunk | steiner}]  [-well] 
.P Routes the secondary power/ground pins of always-on cells to the specified power/ground nets in signal route. You can also control the routing pattern and wire by specifying the pattern, the maximum number of pins per cluster, and non-default rules. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each routePGPinUseSignalRoute parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command: man routePGPinUseSignalRoute   "\fB-all\fR" Routes non-primary power/ground pins of all the cells.   "\fB-nets <listOfNets>\fR" Specifies the power/ground nets to be connected to the secondary power/ground pins.  Default: If this parameter is not specified, the software will get all the nets from global connections for the cells and pins defined in the command setPGPinUseSignalRoute.  "\fB-pattern {trunk | steiner}\fR" Specifies how the signal router routes the secondary power/ground pins.  Trunk: When option maxFanout value is 1, routes the pins to nearest power grid. When the value is more than 1, routes all pins per cluster to the trunk.  Steiner: Routes all pins to a trunk.  Default: trunk  "\fB-maxFanout <number>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of pins per cluster in the trunk rotating pattern.  Default: 5.  "\fB-nonDefaultRule <ruleName>\fR" Specifies the non-default rule the signal router uses to route the secondary power/ground pins.  Default: Regular signal routing rule is used by default.  "\fB-well\fR" Includes nwell and pwell pins  Type: Boolean, Optional
