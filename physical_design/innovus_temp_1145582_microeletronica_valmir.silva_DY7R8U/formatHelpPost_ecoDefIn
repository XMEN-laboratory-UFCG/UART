.SH Name \fBecoDefIn\fR \-  Restores physical information from an old design and compares this information with the design in memory
.SH Syntax \fBecoDefIn\fR  [-help]  [-postMask [-suffix <suffixName>]]  [-useGACells <GACoreSite>]  [-reportFile <fileName>]   [-cleanFEData]  [-keepInstLoc]  [-mergeFloatingRouteToPGNet <netName>]  [-ecoDef {<new_DEF_fileName>}]  <filename> 
.P Restores physical information from an old design and compares this information with the design in memory. This command uses the specified DEF file in the following ways for pre-mask and post-mask ECO:
.RS  "*" 2 Used in pre-mask mode (without the -postMask parameter) this command behaves as follows:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 New cells and nets   Cells that exist in memory but not in the DEF file become unplaced.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Deleted cells or nets   Cells and nets that exist in the DEF file but not in memory are discarded.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Modified nets   Nets found both in the DEF file and in memory, but whose connections are different, are marked as "modified" for further processing during ecoRoute.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Matched cells/nets   Nets and cells that exist both in the DEF file and in memory, and have the same connections, are placed as described in the DEF file. This includes the soft matching capability used in defIn.

.RE
.P  Soft matching happens when a DEF net name does not have an equivalent name and another net is found in memory, that has the same connections as described in the DEF file.   The most common case for soft matching is when nets have multiple aliases in a hierarchical design "net1" = "inst1/net2" = "inst1/inst2/net3" and so on. Any of these net names can be used in the DEF and can have the same connections.  Without soft matching, net `a', for example, is removed and net `b' is created in it's place, resulting in ripping of the wire.
.RS  "*" 2 In post-mask mode (with the -postMask parameter), the software can only change nets, not cells. This command behaves as follows:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 New added cells and nets   Cells that exist in memory but not in the DEF file become unplaced. Later, these cells will be mapped to spare cells when you use ecoPlace-useSpareCells.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Deleted cells   Cells and instances that exist in DEF but not in memory are added to a spare cell list in Innovus: They are not discarded. Deleted cells are renamed with their original name and the suffix you specify. The default suffix is _SPARE. For example, cellA is renamed cellA_SPARE. The software retains deleted nets and their routing, which ecoRoute reroutes later.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Deleted nets   Nets that exist in DEF but not in memory are kept and processed later when you use the ecoRoute command.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Modified nets   Same behavior as in the pre-mask mode.

.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Matched cells and nets   Same behavior as in the pre-mask mode.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 Physical cells   Cells that exist in the DEF file but not in memory, which are marked with +SOURCE DIST in the DEF file, are restored.
.RE 
.RE
.P If you specify -useGACells, this implies a post-mask mode. This option behaves as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 For cells that match the specified GA core site:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 New added GA cell that exists in memory but not in the DEF file are left unplaced.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 New GA cells that exist in the DEF file but not in memory are deleted.
.RE 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 For cells that do not match the specified GA core site, the software treats them as standard cells as described in -postMask mode.
.RE
.P If you specify a report filename, this command reports the following information:
.RS  "*" 2 New cells and nets found in memory but not in the DEF file
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Deleted cells and nets found in DEF but not in memory
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Nets whose connection does not match
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Cells and nets that match in Innovus and DEF
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each ecoDefIn.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man ecoDefIn  "\fB-cleanFEData\fR" Specifies that the routed data is DRC clean. ECO routing will skip routing analysis.  "\fB-ecoDef {<new_def_fileName>}\fR" Specifies the name of a partial DEF file. The tool compares the original routed DEF file or Innovus database with this file and marks the changed instances, changed location of the existing instances, and changed segments or wires.  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the routed/original DEF file to load.  "\fB-keepInstLoc\fR" Applies the placement status and location of the instance in the DEF file to the instance in db.  This option is only applicable in the following special situation:  When an instance in DEF file and an instance in db have the same name but the master cell of the instance in the DEF and in the db do not match, then the instance in DEF is considered as deleted while the instance in db is added. In this case, if the option is not specified, the general rule for addition or deletion of an instance is applied as described earlier. For the added instance, the placement status is set to unplaced. If the option is specified, the placement status and location of the instance in the DEF file is applied to the instance in db.  "\fB-mergeFloatingRouteToPGNet <netName>\fR" Merges the routing data to the specified PG net. In this case, the physical-only net will not be created.  When this parameter is not specified, if a net is deleted in the new netlist but exists in the DEF file, then the ecoDefIn command discards the net in pre-mask ECO and creates a physical-only net in post-mask ECO to preserve the routing data on the net.  "\fB-postMask\fR" Runs this command in post-route mode.  "\fB-reportFile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name for the report generated by the ecoDefIn command.  Default: ecoDefIn.rpt  "\fB-suffix <suffixName>\fR" Appends the specified suffix to cells that appear in the DEF file but have been deleted in the new netlist.  Default: _SPARE  "\fB-useGACells <GACoreSite>\fR" Specifies the GA Core Site. 
.SH Examples
.P The following example reads a DEF file, myOld.def, for post-mask ECO.
.P ecoDefIn -postMask -suffix _SPARE -reportFile ecoDefIn.rpt myOld.def
.P When the software converts a deleted instance to a spare cell, it adds the _SPARE suffix to the instance. This command generates a report ecoDefIn.rpt.
.P The following example shows a report file:
.P DELINST DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/PROG_BUS_MACH_INST/i_9649 INVX1  (converted to spare cell  DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/PROG_BUS_MACH_INST/i_9649_SPARE)
.P ADDINST DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/PROG_BUS_MACH_INST/i_9649 BUFX8  MODIFYNET dtmf_chip_TIELO_Y_r2c1   ADDNET DTMF_INST/UNCONNECTED_000   ADDNET DTMF_INST/UNCONNECTED_001   ADDNET DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/UNCONNECTED_000  ADDNET DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/UNCONNECTED_009  ADDNET DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/UNCONNECTED_010
