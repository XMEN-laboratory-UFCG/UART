.SH Name \fBsetPGPinUseSignalRoute\fR \-  Sets the internal bit for a given cell/pin pair to be routed by the signal router
.SH Syntax \fBsetPGPinUseSignalRoute\fR  [-off]   [-all]  cellPins cellName:pinName cellName:pinName2
...  [-well]
.P Sets the internal bit for a given cell/pin pair to be routed by the signal router. Use this command to enable NanoRoute to route always-on-pins in SRPG (state retention power gating) or always-on buffer cells. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-all\fR" Routes all backup and non-main_rail primary power/ground pins.  Type: Boolean, Optional  "\fBcellPins <cellName:pinName>\fR"  "*" 2 <cellName>:Specifies the cell containing the pin for NanoRoute to route. You can use a wildcard to specify all cells of certain type.  "*" 2 <pinName>:Specifies the pin name of the secondary PG pin to be routed.  "\fB-off\fR" Unsets this feature for the specified list of cellPins or cellName:pinName.  "\fB-well\fR" Includes nwell and pwell pins.  Type: Boolean, Optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands set both the vddo and vsso pins for the signal router, but NanoRoute will only route vddo:   setPGPinUseSignalRoute SDRFF:vddo SDRFF:vsso  routePGPinUseSignalRoute -nets VDD
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets NanoRoute to route the VDD1 pin of all NAND cells:   setPGPinUseSignalRoute NAND*:VDD1  "*" 2 The following command unsets NanoRoute to route the VDD1 pin of all the NAND cells, which were set earlier:  setPGPinUseSignalRoute NAND*:VDD1 -off
