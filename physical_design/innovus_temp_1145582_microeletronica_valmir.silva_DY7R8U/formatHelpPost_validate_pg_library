.P Specifies to validate a macro PGV. The command takes a macro PGV and Liberty file as input, and performs IR Drop based validation by running static and dynamic power and rail analysis. In this flow, Library Generation will read the input PGV and generate a dummy DEF file that has an instance of the macro (one-cell design). It will then run static/dynamic power and rail analysis on this design. You can analyze the power and rail results to check for hotspots, connectivity, and current distribution inside the PGV. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help \fR" Outputs the command usage.   "\fB-activity <value>\fR" Specifies the activity value for input pins. If not specified, a default activity of 0.2 is used. The activity specifies the number of times an input pin switches in a clock cycle.  "\fB-cell<cell_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the cell to be validated.   "\fB-clock {<clk1> <clk2>
...}\fR" Specifies the list of clock pins.   "\fB-disable_rail_analysis {true | false}\fR" Specifies to disable rail analysis during macro PGV validation.  The following is the behavior of -disable_rail_analysis true with the -enable_xp parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 if -enable_xp is set to true, the tool will run only power analysis in the XP mode  "*" 2 if -enable_xp is set to false, the tool will enable only power analysis in the non-XP or normal mode
.RE   Default: false  "\fB-dynamic_analysis_duration <value>\fR" Specifies the simulation period that dynamic power analysis will use. It is the duration for which a window is selected for calculation of IR drop during power analysis. The default value is 10ns.   "\fB-enable_xp {true | false}\fR" Specifies to validate the macro PGV in the extensively parallel (XP) mode.  Default: false  "\fB-extraction_tech_file <tech_file_path>\fR" Specifies the path of the extraction technology file.   "\fB-frequency <value>\fR" Specifies the clock frequency. The default value is 100Mhz.   "\fB-input_pin_set_case_analysis_low {<pin1> <pin2>...}\fR" Specifies the list of pins to be kept at a logical low. The set_case_analysis command in the SDC file will have the same effect as the set pin to constant value command described here.   "\fB-input_pin_set_case_analysis_high {<pin1> <pin2>...}\fR" Specifies the list of pins to be kept at a logical high. The set_case_analysis command in the SDC file will have the same effect as the set pin to constant value command described here.   "\fB-liberty <liberty_file>\fR" Specifies the name of the Liberty file for power calculation.  This parameter is optional for the static power analysis flow, and is mandatory for the dynamic power analysis flow. In the static flow, you need to specify either -liberty or -set_total_power. If both the parameters are specified, the -set_total_power parameter will be honored.  "\fB-max_ir_drop <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum IR drop allowed. Default is 5 (in percentage).   "\fB-net_capacitance <value>\fR" Specifies the value of the net capacitance. The default value is 1pF.   "\fB-output <output_dir>\fR" Specifies the name of the output directory. This directory saves the power and rail reports, and the design output (such as
.lef,
.def, and so on).   "\fB-pgv_mode_dynamic_switch_pattern <pattern>\fR" Specifies the switching patterns for the functional modes in the dynamic power calculation flow. The use model of this parameter is same as the set_power -dynamic_switch_pattern parameter.  In the following example, the mode write will switch in the 1st clock cycle, the mode read will switch in the 2nd and 4th clock cycles, and none of the modes will switch in the 3rd clock cycle:   validate_pg_library -pgv_mode_dynamic_switch_pattern { write read - read }  "\fB-pin_capacitance <value>\fR" Specifies the value of the pin capacitance. The default value is 1pF.   "\fB-power_grid_library_path <pgv_path>\fR" Specifies the path of the power-grid library file.   "\fB-power_grid_library_view <view_name>\fR" Specifies the power-grid view name.   "\fB-power_include_file <filename>\fR" Specifies a power analysis include file. This file specifies certain commands of the dynamic engine that do not have a Voltus equivalent. This parameter is applicable only to the dynamic power analysis flow.   "\fB-power_pad_size <value>\fR" Specifies the distance between two adjacent DEF voltage sources. The default value is 50 (in Micron).   "\fB-rail_analysis_type {static | dynamic}\fR" Specifies whether static or dynamic analysis will be done. The default value is static.   "\fB-rail_include_file_begin <filename>\fR" Provides a file that includes additional rail  options that will be run prior to the analyze command. This can be used for those legacy rail analysis commands that do not have a Voltus equivalent.   "\fB-rail_include_file_end <filename>\fR" Provides a file that includes additional rail  options that will be run after the analyze command. This can be used for those legacy rail analysis commands that do not have a Voltus equivalent.   "\fB-rail_trigger_switching_pattern <pattern>\fR" Default: None  Specifies a dynamic trigger file. When a Macro EM view with current signature is used in a design, it needs to be determined when this block/cell is triggered. The dynamic trigger file is used to determine this. The use model of this parameter is same as the set_rail_analysis_mode -dynamic_trigger_file parameter.  "\fB-sdc_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the timing constraints file.   "\fB-set_power_switching_pattern <trigger_file>\fR" Default: None  Specifies the stimulus pattern on the pins of an instance and cell. Specify this parameter only in the dynamic mode for the type instance and cell. The use model of this parameter is same as the set_power -dynamic_switch_pattern parameter.  "\fB-set_total_power <value>\fR" Specifies the total power for the design in Watts. This power is distributed based on cell area.   "\fB-step_size <value>\fR" Specifies the simulation step size, in picoseconds. The default value is 20ps. This parameter is applicable only to the dynamic power analysis flow.   "\fB-supply_voltage <value>\fR" Specifies the voltage of each power supply pin. The default value is 1V.   "\fB-tech_lef_file <tech_lef_file_path>\fR" Specifies the path of the technology LEF file.   "\fB-temperature <value>\fR" Sets the temperature for static power calculation. The default is 125 degrees.   "\fB-transition_time <time>\fR" Specifies the transition time for specific pins or instances in the design. This parameter is applicable only to the dynamic power analysis flow.   "\fB-twf_path <twf_location>\fR" Specifies the location of the Timing Window File (TWF) for noise and power calculation.   "\fB-user_defined_ploc_file<filename>\fR" Specifies the name of a file containing net names and corresponding user-defined ploc or power pad files (.pploc). The
.pploc file includes power pin or voltage source locations for power and ground nets. The parameter gives you the flexibility to include either user-specified or tool-generated voltage sources.  The following is a sample file with the list of nets and power pad files:  ----ploc.list----  #<NET_NAME> <Pointer to ploc file>  VDD   input/ploc/VDD.pploc VDDA  input/ploc/VDDA.pploc VDDF  input/ploc/VDDF.pploc VSS   input/ploc/VSS.pploc  When specified, the voltage source location files (.pploc) in the given <ploc.list> file will be used for library generation. If the pploc file is missing for a few nets in the <ploc.list> file, then library generation will automatically generate
.pploc for those nets.
