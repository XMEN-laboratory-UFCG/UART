.SH Name \fBset_glitch_derate\fR \-  Sets the derating factors for glitch waveforms and determines the effect of on-chip variation on noise
.SH Syntax \fBset_glitch_derate\fR    [-help]  [-derate_height <float>]   [-derate_width <float>]   [-glitch_type <string>]   [-instance_pin <string>]  [-offset <float>]   [-pin <string>]   [-view <string>]
.P Sets the derating factors for glitch waveforms and determines the effect of on-chip variation on noise. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.  "\fB-derate_height <float>\fR" Specifies the derate height value.  This parameter scales all the glitch waveforms on the specified pins.  A value of 1.0 indicates that no glitch waveform derating will take place. A value greater than 1.0, such as 1.1, indicates a 10 percent increase in the magnitude of the complete glitch waveform, which results in an increase in propagated noise and noise failure. A value less than 1.0 reduces the magnitude of the complete glitch waveform.  "\fB-derate_width <float>\fR" Specifies the derate width value.   "\fB-glitch_type <string>\fR" Specifies the glitch type - vl, vh, or all.  "\fB-instance_pin <string>\fR" Specifies the instance pin names on which derate is to be applied.   "\fB-offset <float>\fR" Specifies the derate offset value.   "\fB-pin <string>\fR" Specifies the library pin names on which derate value is to be applied.  "\fB-view <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the view.
