.SH Name \fBreportCapViolation\fR \-  After timing analysis, reports nets that exceed the maximum capacitance constraints in the timing library and timing constraints file. Run this command after running timing analysis (timeDesign) or timing optimization (optDesign)
.SH Syntax \fBreportCapViolation\fR  [-help]   [-all | -noGlobalNets]  [-max]  [-min]  [-outfile <fileName>]   [-selNetFile <fileName>]  [-excNetFile <fileName>]   [-significant_digits <integer>]   [-useDrcMargin] 
.P After timing analysis, reports nets that exceed the maximum capacitance constraints in the timing library and timing constraints file. Run this command after running timing analysis (timeDesign) or timing optimization (optDesign). 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportCapViolation parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man reportCapViolation  "\fB-all \fR" Reports capacitance violations for all nets in the design. This is the default option.   "\fB-excNetFile <f><ileName>\fR" Specifies the file that contains the hierarchical net names that are excluded from the capacitance violation report.  "\fB-noGlobalNets\fR" Reports capacitance violations on all nets except for power and ground nets.  Note: The parameters, -all and -noGlobalNets are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-max \fR" Reports only maximum capacitance violations. This is the default option.   "\fB-min\fR" Reports only minimum capacitance violations.  Note: The parameters, -min and -max are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-outfile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the file to which the results are written.  "\fB-selNetFile <f><ileName>\fR" Specifies the file that contains the hierarchical net names for the report. Only these net names are considered for inclusion in the capacitance violation report.  Note: The parameters, -selNetFile and -excNetFile are not mutually exclusive. If both parameters are specified, the -excNetFile parameter overides the -selNetFile parameter.  "\fB-significant_digits <integer>\fR" Allows the user to specify the number of significant digits.  Default: 3  "\fB-useDrcMargin\fR" Generates the report using the margin value that you specify using the -drcMargin parameter of the setOptModecommand. 
.SH Example
.P The following command reports nets that exceed the maximum capacitance constraints in the report file maxcap.report:
.P reportCapViolation -outfile maxCap.report
