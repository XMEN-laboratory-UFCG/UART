.TH get_pins  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBget_pins\fR \-  Creates a collection of instance pins whose name matches the supplied pattern list
.SH Syntax \fBget_pins\fR  [-help]  [-hierarchical]   [-hsc <char>]   [-filter <expr>]  [-leaf]  [-regexp]   [-nocase]  [-quiet]   {<patterns> | -of_objects <object_list>}  
.P Creates a collection of instance pins whose name matches the supplied pattern list. Assign this collection to a variable or pass it as an argument to another command. If no such pin is found, an empty collection is returned. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression. For any pins that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the pin. If the expression is set to true, the pin is included in the result.  You can filter pins using any of the pin properties supported through the get_property command.  "\fB-hierarchical\fR" Specifies that patterns should match hierarchically. If the hierarchical name of a pin at any hierarchical level matches the patterns, it is included in the result.  "\fB-hsc <char>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical delimiter for patterns.  "\fB-leaf\fR" Returns leaf pins only.  When the -leaf parameter is not used, the get_pins command returns the hierarchical pins present on a net along with the flat pins at the same hierarchical level as the specified object.  "\fB-nocase\fR" Specifies that pattern matching is not case sensitive.  Note: You must specify -regexp in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all pins associated with the specified cells or nets. You can specify a list of cells or a list of nets, but you cannot specify a list that contains both cells and nets. You can specify patterns for the cell or net names, a collection of cells or nets, or a combination of patterns and a collection.  "\fB<patterns>\fR" Specifies patterns for pin names. Patterns include the * and ? wildcard characters and collections of pins.  "\fB-quiet\fR" Suppresses all error and warning messages generated when the get_pins command is run.  "\fB-regexp\fR" Treats the specified patterns as regular expression patterns.  Default: Treats the specified pattern as wildcard
