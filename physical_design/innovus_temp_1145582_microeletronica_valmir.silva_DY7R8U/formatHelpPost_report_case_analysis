.SH Name \fBreport_case_analysis\fR \-  Generates a User Case Analysis table, which reports ports and pin that have a set_case_analysis constraint
.SH Syntax  \fBreport_case_analysis\fR  [-all]   [-nosplit]   [-dir]  [-view <view_name>]  [-propagated]   [-verbose]   [<pins_and_ports_list>]  [{> | >>}<filename> | -tcl_list] 
.P Generates a User Case Analysis table, which reports ports and pin that have a set_case_analysis constraint. These ports and pins are constant only for timing analysis. You can optionally generate a Logic Constant Value table, which reports ports and pins whose constant status is part of the design. Information from this table includes ports or pins with set_logic constraints (set_logic_zero and set_logic_one), netlist explicit constants, and output pins with constant output functions. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB{> | >>} <filename>\fR" When specified with >, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.  The <filename> parameter must be the last argument in the list. The <filename> and -tcl_list parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  Note: To write a compressed report, add the
.gz extension to the file name.  Default: Report is displayed on standard output without being saved.  "\fB-all\fR" Specifies that the Logic Constant Value table report pins or ports with set_logic constants, constants in the netlist, and output pins with a constant function. These output pins are from library cells or netlist modules.  "\fB-nosplit\fR" Specifies that reports with long names will not be split into multiple lines.  Note: The -nosplit parameter works if set_table_style -no_frame_fix_width command is specified.  "\fB-dir\fR" Specifies that the report include the direction of the pin or port, which is reported as input, output, or inout (internal pins may not have constant constraints).  "\fB<pins_and_ports_list>\fR" Generates a report only for the pins and ports in the specified list.  Default: Generates a report for all pins and ports in the design.  "\fB-propagated\fR" Generates a report that includes all constant pins, including pins with propagated constants. When specified, the report column header for constant values changes to Constant value.  Default: Generates a report that includes only pins with a set_case_analysis constraint. (The column header for the constant values is labeled as User case analysis value.)  "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Produces the report in Tcl list format instead of a tabular format. This is useful for integrating timing with custom Tcl functions, and also for customizing report generation.  The -tcl_list and <filename> parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  "\fB-verbose\fR" Generates a report in which each pin is listed on a separate line with a cause. If the pin is a propagated constant, a table is included that reports a chain of constants from an original cause to the reported pin.  Default: All pins are reported in a table.  "\fB-view <view_name>\fR" Generates a User Case Analysis table for the specified analysis view only. To specify this parameter, the software must be in multi-mode multi-corner (MMMC) analysis mode.  Default: When in MMMC analysis mode, generates a table for all active analysis views 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command uses the -dir option, which shows that 1 is on the input part of the timing_const_on_Z/Z pin:  report_case_analysis -dir  The following report is generated:
.RE
.P -------------------------------------------------   Pin name        Dir               User case                                    Analysis value   ------------------------------------------------   gscanmode       input            0    gscanenable     input            0    ------------------------------------------------
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates a report that includes all constant pins, including pins with propagated constants. When specified, the report column header for constant values changes to Constant value.   report_case_analysis -propagated  The following report is generated:
.RE
.P -------------------------------------------   Pin name                   Constant value   -------------------------------------------   clockandlatch/U8/TE        0    clockandlatch_dup1/U8/TE   1    clockandlatch_dup2/U8/TE   1    clockandlatch_dup3/U8/TE   0   ------------------------------------------
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates a report in which each pin is listed on a separate line. The report includes all constant pins, including pins with propagated constants. The pin clockandlatch_dup3/U8/TE is reported because of a set_case_analysis 0 assertion on pin gscanenable.   report_case_analysis -propagated -verbose clockandlatch_dup3/U8/TE  The following report is generated:
.RE

.RS  "*" 2 The following report shows that there are no set_case_analysis constraints but there are logical constraints:  report_case_analysis -propagated -verbose core_q_reg_1_/SI
