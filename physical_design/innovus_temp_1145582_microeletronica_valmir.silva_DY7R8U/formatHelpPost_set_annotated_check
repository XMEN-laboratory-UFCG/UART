.TH set_annotated_check  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_annotated_check\fR \-  Annotates the setup, hold, recovery, or removal timing check value between two or more pins of a cell in the current design
.SH Syntax \fBset_annotated_check\fR   [-help]   <check_value>  [-clock <clock_check>]  [-cond <sdf_condtion>]   [-fall]  -from <from_pins>  [-incremental]   [-max]  [-min]   [-rise]  -to <to_pins>  {-setup | -hold | -recovery | -removal | -nochange_high | -nochange_low}
.P Annotates the setup, hold, recovery, or removal timing check value between two or more pins of a cell in the current design. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB<check_value>\fR" Specifies the timing check value.  "\fB-clock <clock_check>\fR" Specifies clock rising or falling.  Default: Sets checks for both clock rise and fall. Use the <clock_check> argument to specify rise or fall.  "\fB-cond <sdf_condition>\fR" Specifies the condition only if the library has a condition attached to the specified timing check arc. The <sdf_expression>must match the syntax of the condition specified in the library.  "\fB-fall\fR" Specifies the data fall transition for the timing check.  Default: Sets both -rise and -fall.  "\fB-from <from_pins>\fR" Specifies start points of the timing arcs for which checks are annotated. Use the <from_pins> argument to specify a list of leaf cell clock pins.  "\fB-incremental\fR" Set incremental checks.   "\fB-max\fR" Specifies the maximum timing check for both data rise and data fall transitions. Use this option only if the design uses minimum and maximum (min-max) operating conditions.  "\fB-min \fR" Specifies the minimum timing check for both data rise and data fall transitions. Use this option only if the design uses minimum and maximum (min-max) operating conditions.  "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies the data rise transition for the timing check.  Default: Sets both rise and fall.  "\fB-setup | -hold | -recovery | -removal | -nochange_high | -nochange_low\fR" Specifies the timing check type. Make sure there is a corresponding timing arc between the <from_pins> and the <to_pins> arguments.  "\fB-to<to_pins>\fR" Specifies endpoints of the timing arcs for which checks are annotated. Use the <to_pins> argument to specify a list of leaf cell clock pins. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands annotates a nochange check between data low and clock low. The nochange margin before the clock is 1.3 and the nochange margin after the clock is 2.4:  set_annotated_check -nochange_low 1.3 -clock fall -fall -from {I1/CP} -to {I1/EN}  set_annotated_check -nochange_low 2.4 -clock fall -rise -from {I1/CP} -to {I1/EN}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command annotates a 2.0 setup time between the CP clock pin and the A data pin of the <<instance_name>> instance:   set_annotated_check -setup 2.0 -from <<instance_name>>/CP -to <<instance_name>>/A
