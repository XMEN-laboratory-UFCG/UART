.SH Name \fBread_sdf\fR \-  Reads an OVI Standard Delay Format (SDF) file and annotates user-specified delay information from the SDF file into the timing system
.SH Syntax \fBread_sdf\fR  [-help]  <sdf_file_name>   [-continue_on_error]   [-ilm_filter]   [-increment]   [-overwrite_incremental_delay]  [-path <instanceName>]   [-persistent]   [-print_summary]   [-scale <float>]   [-strict_cond_matching]  [-view <viewName>]   [-sdf_field {min|typ|max} | [-early_sdf_field {min|typ|max}] [-late_sdf_field {min|typ|max}]] 
.P Reads an OVI Standard Delay Format (SDF) file and annotates user-specified delay information from the SDF file into the timing system. You can use the read_sdf command to supply pre-calculated delays and timing check values from an external delay calculator, or from a previous Innovus session.
.P The read_sdf command can read version 2.1 and 3.0 of the SDF files, and can read both plain-text and GNU zipped (.gz) format files. The command and the Innovus software do not support the Timing Environment section of the SDF specification.
.P The SDF file can provide one, two, or three different values for each timing arc delay or timing check value. These values are passed in the min, typ, or max SDF delay fields, represented as min:typ:max.
.P Innovus provides multiple delay place holders to store the calculated or annotated delay information:
.RS  "*" 2 In single-corner (setAnalysisMode -analysisType single) analysis mode, only max delays are available.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 In best-case worst-case (setAnalysisMode -analysisType bcwc) mode, a min delay slot is provided for storing min delays used for hold analysis. A max delay slot stores delays used for setup analysis.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 In on-chip variation (setAnalysisMode -analysisType onChipVariation) mode, the early delay slots store delays used for calculated early arrival times. The late delay slot stores delays used for calculated late arrival times.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 In multi-corner mode, an early and a late delay slot are provided for each multi-mode multi-corner analysis view.
.RE
.P The read_sdf command provides parameters for controlling how the SDF min:typ:max triplet values are mapped into the Innovus software's delay slots. The correct mapping depends on how the delay information in the SDF file was created, and what type of analysis you are performing.
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P The timing system provides special handling for annotating incremental delays. These delays typically represent plus or minus offsets due to crosstalk effects. Incremental delay annotation to the Innovus software can be done by:
.RS  "*" 2 Importing an incremental SDF file (SDF has an internal INCREMENT keyword) using the read_sdf command.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Tcl sourcing a file of set_annotated_delay -net -delta_only constraints.
.RE
.P The incremental delay annotations can be viewed in the report_timing report by adding the incr_delay option to the report_timing -format list, or to the report_timing_format global variable. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-continue_on_error\fR" Continues to read the file if an error occurs. By default, when an error occurs, the read_sdf command stops reading the file. Use this parameter to attempt to continue reading the file, if possible.  Note: If you continue some annotations may be missing due to the errors. You can use the  report_annotated_parasiticsreport_annotated_parasitics command to find the missing annotations. If the SDF file is corrupted, you can obtain a file.  "\fB-early_sdf_field {min | typ | max} \fR" Annotates the early delay from the specified SDF field.  In single-corner mode, all setup and hold analysis use maximum delays. The software ignores any minimum or early delay information.  In best-case worst-case mode, use this parameter to specify which SDF field to use for hold analysis.  In on-chip variation mode, the software uses the early delay for calculation of fast paths.  "\fB-ilm_filter\fR" Ignores ILM-related errors. By default, the read_sdf command does not ignore errors reported due to missing arcs in core ILM.  "\fB-increment\fR" Increments the total delay without affecting the delta delay.  By default, when the SDF file contains the INCREMENT delay type, the read_sdf command will perform an adjustment on the delta delay slot which models SI cross-talk push-out/pull-in effects. When this option is used, the INCREMENT delays will be applied against the static base delay values instead.  "\fB-late_sdf_field {min | typ | max}\fR" Annotates the late delay from the specified SDF field.  In single-corner mode, use this parameter to specify which of the SDF triplet values to annotate for both setup and hold checks.  In best-case worst-case mode, use this parameter to specify which SDF field to use for setup analysis.  In on-chip variation mode, the software uses the late delay for the calculation of slow paths.  "\fB-overwrite_incremental_delay\fR" When annotating an incremental SDF file, replaces any pre-existing delta delays with the new SDF values. The total delay will be equivalent to the original base delay, plus the new delta delay.  If the delays in the incremental SDF file represent crosstalk delay push-outs from a signal integrity analysis, use the -overwrite_incremental_delay parameter to ensure that any stale data from a previous analysis is removed.  By default, when an incremental SDF file (SDF has an internal INCREMENT keyword) is annotated, the delays are added to the base delay, and also stored separately as delta delays. If an additional incremental SDF file is annotated, the software adds the existing base and delta delays with the new values.  "\fB-path <instanceName>\fR" Specifies the instance in the design to which the specified SDF file should be applied.  "\fB-persistent \fR" Keeps the delays from certain SDF files persistently in use during various steps of the timing optimization
. Use this parameter to support pre-timed structures, such as clock meshes.  "\fB-print_summary\fR" Outputs the summary information of annotated delays.  "\fB-scale <float>\fR" Overrides the automatic scaling of SDF delays to the library units by the value given. To disable all scaling, use a value of 1.0.  "\fB-sdf_field {min | typ | max}\fR" Annotates the delay from the specified SDF slot.  In single-corner and best-case worst-case modes, the software uses this value for both setup and hold analysis.  In on-chip variation mode, the software uses the same value from the specified SDF slot for both the early and late delays of the specified arc.  "\fB<sdf_filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the SDF file that has the back annotation data.  "\fB-strict_cond_matching\fR" Annotates only the conditions that are an exact syntax-to-syntax match between the SDF file and the
.lib file.  Default: Uses looser conditional matching rules between the
.lib and SDF arc specifications.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Annotates the specified analysis view(s) with the delays from the SDF file. You can use this parameter only when you are in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.
