.SH Name \fBhighlight\fR \-  Highlights selected or specified objects with the Highlight Set available through the  View - Highlight Selected menu
.SH Syntax \fBhighlight\fR  [-help]  [<<any_object>>+]  [-index <indexValue> | -auto_color  | -original]   [-color <colorValue> | -auto_color  | -original]   [-pattern <patternValue> | -original] 
.P Highlights selected or specified objects with the Highlight Set available through the  View - Highlight Selected menu. The value for the index corresponds to the Highlight Set that will be applied. For example, a value of 4 for the index specifies that all selected objects will be highlighted with the same color and pattern as available for the Highlight Set #4 in the  View - Highlight Selected menu. You can use this command at any stage in the design flow.
.P You can also provide a specific color and/or pattern to be used. All selected objects will be highlighted with the color and/or pattern that you specify. 
.P If you specify a color and or pattern, the Highlight Set corresponding to the index value will be updated to use the color and pattern specified. For example, if you specify an index value of 5, color green, and pattern backslash, the Highlight Set #5 will get updated to have the color green and the pattern backslash.
.P You can dehighlight the highlighted objects through the dehighlight command or through the  View - Clear Highlight menu.
.P  Note: If an object is selectable, you can highlight it using the highlight command.
.P Use the highlight_pin command to highlight shapes for specified SIGNAL/POWER pins. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each highlight parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man highlight  "\fB<any_object+>\fR" Specifies object pointer list for highlighting.   "\fB-auto_color\fR" Specifies the object color automatically. When this parameter is specified, the selected object is highlighted with a different color each time you call the highlight command.  Note: This parameter cannot be used with -index or -color.  "\fB-index <indexValue>\fR" Specifies the index value for the specified object.  All objects that are selected will be highlighted with the same color and pattern as defined in corresponding Highlight Set in the View - Highlight Selected menu  As an example, if you specify a value of 3 for index, all objects that are selected will be highlighted with the same color and pattern as available for the Highlight Set #3 in the View - Highlight Selected menu.  Note that the maximum value is related to the Number of Highlight Color setting in the Edit Highlight Color form. If this value is 64, the maximum acceptable value for the -index option is 64. If set to 256, the maximum acceptable value for -index is 256.  The minimum value is 1.  "\fB-color <colorValue>\fR" Specifies the color value for the specified object. The color value is the same as that available through the Edit Highlight Color form (View - Edit Highlight Color).  You can also use the Red Green Blue (RGB) value in the following format: #<V1V2V3> where V1, V2, and V3 are the hexadecimal values for the red, green, and blue color components respectively. For example, you can specify the value #CC66FF.  Default: The color defined for the Highlight Set corresponding to the index value is used.  "\fB-original\fR" Highlights the object in original color. This option is useful if you want to check a specific object more closely with the background dimmed. An object highlighted in original color will stand out in the dimmed background:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note: This parameter cannot be used with -index, -color, or -pattern.  "\fB-pattern <patternValue>\fR" Specifies the pattern value for the specified object. The pattern value is the same as the Stipple Value available through the Edit Highlight Color form.
