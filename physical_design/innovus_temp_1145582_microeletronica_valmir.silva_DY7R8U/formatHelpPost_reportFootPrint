.SH Name \fBreportFootPrint\fR \-  Creates a file that contains footprint attribute information from the timing library
.SH Syntax \fBreportFootPrint\fR  [-help]   [-outfile <fileName>]  [-dontTouchNUse]   [<footprint>] 
.P Creates a file that contains footprint attribute information from the timing library. Use this file to check your design for missing footprint function names and timing information. You can edit the output file and use it to load the correct footprint information. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportFootPrint parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man reportFootPrint  "\fB-dontTouchNUse\fR" When this parameter is specified, cell footprints are reported for all cells, including those cells that have dont_touch or dont_use attribute.  When this parameter is not specified, cell footprints are reported for only those cells that do not have dont_touch and dont_use attributes.  "\fB<footprint>\fR" Specifies the footprint to report. If you do not specify this parameter, reports all footprints.  "\fB-outfile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the footprint report file. 
.SH Command Order
.P Use this command after importing the design or after using the loadFootPrint command. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a footprint report file named INV.rpt:   reportFootPrint -outfile INV.rpt
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following output from the reportFootPrint command shows the format of the footprint file:   # Format:  # Library:<library name>  # cell footprint drvResR drvResF functions  # footPrint: INV nrCell: 1 Library: dp_ram128x32_4x1  Library:stdCellLib  inv_2 INV     1            110.983    89.427    x=(~a)  Lines beginning with a # are comment lines, which are ignored when the footprint file is loaded.
