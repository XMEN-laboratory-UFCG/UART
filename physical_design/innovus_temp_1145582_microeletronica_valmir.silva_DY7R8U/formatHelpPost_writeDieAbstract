.SH Name \fBwriteDieAbstract\fR \-  Writes the abstract of current die to a file
.SH Syntax \fBwriteDieAbstract\fR  <DIEABSTRACTFILE>  [-noFilter] 
.P Writes the abstract of current die to a file. It also writes the OBS for die edge checking to the die abstract file. Specify this command after the initial floorplan is loaded. The file will be imported by the adjacent die and therefore the current design will be honored by the adjacent die.
.P This command supports the embedded bump flow for hierarchical designs.
.P Note: By default, the proposed behavior for writeDieAbstract is:
.RS  "*" 2 For MACRO pin geometries, output ports on top metal layer in all MACROS of all classes.  "*" 2 For routing, output routing for all top level Verilog ports, and for power and ground, output only those wires with a SHAPE of IOWIRE.
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<DIEABSTRACTFILE>\fR" Specifies the file name.  "\fB-noFilter\fR" Turn off to filter the die abstract contents. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a die abstract file die1.abs:  writeDieAbstract die1.abs
