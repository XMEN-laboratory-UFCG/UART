.P Pushes macros (or pack of macros) to core corners and marks them fixed.
.P The pack_align_macros command executes the following two steps:
.RS  "*" 2 Aligns macros of the same size (initially placed together) on the entire design.  "*" 2 Pushes macros (or pack of macros) to core corners and marks them fixed.

.P The Figure 1 and Figure 2 show a design before and after running the pack_align_macros, respectively. The Figure 2 shows that the push till the core corner takes place when the gap between the core corner and the corner of the nearest macro satisfies the following  condition:  GY <= MY  And  GX <= MX
