.TH timing_socv_view_based_nsigma_multiplier_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_socv_view_based_nsigma_multiplier_mode\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_socv_view_based_nsigma_multiplier_mode\fR {true | false} 
.P Default: true
.P Enables setting of view-based separate setup and hold sigma multipliers.
.P By default or with an explicit true setting, the timing system is configured to support different N-sigma multiplier values for Setup vs. Hold - and for different analysis views. The specific N-sigma multipliers can be set using the set_socv_reporting_nsigma_multiplier command.
.P In earlier releases, the timing_set_nsigma_multiplier global variable was used to specify a single N-sigma value that was used for both Setup and Hold analysis across all analysis views. To continue using older scripts with this control, you can set the timing_socv_view_based_nsigma_multiplier_mode global variable to false.
.P Note: This backward compatibility option will not be supported in future releases. It is recommended to migrate your scripts to use the new view-based methodology.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
