.P This command reports the voltage for the net/pin (term)/inst in the specific view under a specific corner. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each reportVoltage parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man reportVoltage  "\fB-early\fR" Specifies that the voltage is repoted in the early mode.  "\fB-inst <string>\fR" Reports the specified instance's power domain, cell name, timing library, view, mode, power net, and voltage information.  "\fB-late\fR" Specifies that the voltage is reported in the late mode.   "\fB-net <string>\fR" Specifies the net voltage (driver's pin voltage).   "\fB-quiet\fR" Displays only the pin voltage-related information without other additional unnecessary information to avoid huge log size.   "\fB-term <string>\fR" Specifies the term voltage.   "\fB-view <string>\fR" Specifies the analysis view.
