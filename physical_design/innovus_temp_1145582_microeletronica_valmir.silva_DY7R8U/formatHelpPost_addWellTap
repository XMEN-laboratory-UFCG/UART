.P Adds physical-only well-tap cells. Well-tap cells are physical-only filler cells that are required by some technology libraries to limit resistance between power or ground connections and wells of the substrate. Well-tap cells are placed in a preplaced status.
.RS  "*" 2 To delete well-tap cells, use the deleteFiller command.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 To verify well-tap placement, generate markers for violations caused by well-tap cells, and create a violation report, use the verifyWellTap command.
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-area <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the bounding box, in microns. By default, the core box that encloses all core rows is used.
.RS  "*" 2 x1: Specifies the area's lower left point on the x axis.  "*" 2 y1: Specifies the area's lower left point on the y axis.  "*" 2 x2: Specifies the area's upper right point on the x axis.  "*" 2 y2: Specifies the area's upper right point on the y axis.
.RE   "\fB-avoidAbutment\fR" Specifies whether the inserted taps should avoid horizontal and vertical abutment.  "\fB-block_boundary_only {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to insert termination tap cells only for well tap columns on the block boundary. Default is false, termination cells are inserted on both core boundary row and block boundary row.
.P Note: This parameter works only when inserting termination cells.   "\fB-bottom_termination_cell <cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of termination cells to be used at the bottom.   "\fB-cell <cellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the cell in the technology library to use as a well-tap. The cell should be of class type CORE.   "\fB-cellInterval <microns>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance from the center of one well-tap cell to the center of the following well-tap cell in the same row. If well-tap cells cannot be placed at this location due to a placement blockage, the software searches for a legal location: first, towards the previous well-tap cell, and then farther away.   "\fB-channel_offset <offset_value>\fR" Specifies the offset value between taps and blockage in channel.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 1.79769313486232e+308  "\fB-check_channel\fR" Inserts well taps inside channel.   "\fB-checkerBoard\fR" Places the well-tap cells in a checkered pattern, that is, with every other row offset by one-half gap. In rows where a one-half offset gap is not available in the row above or below, the tap-cell is inserted at one-half gap in the row in question.Thus, for a simple floorplan, the first and last rows will have well-taps at one-half gap only, while all other rows will have the full gap.   When a floorplan has hard blocks or placement blockages, the rows above and below the block (or blockage) will also have well-taps at one-half gap.  Note: When this parameter is specified, -skipRow is ignored.  "\fB<-column_cell> <tap_column_cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of well tap columns that need to be terminated.  This parameter must be specified for termination tap cell insertion.  "\fB-fixCutCell\fR" Fixes all the instances which belong to the wellCutCell list.  "\fB-fixedGap\fR" Ensures that the specified gap is always maintained. That is, the software does not search for a legal location if it cannot place well-tap cells at the specified -cellInterval. Instead, it goes on to place well-tap cells at the next position.
.P You can modify the gap by using the -pitch and -pitchOffset parameters.   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each addWellTap parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man addWellTap.  "\fB-incremental <list_of_cells>\fR" Checks whether any instances of the cells specified in the <list_of_cells> are within 0.45 times the  -cellInterval from the next well-tap cell in the same row. If so, does not add well-tap cells at that location.   "\fB-inRowOffset <microns>\fR" Specifies the offset, in microns, of the first well-tap cell from the start of the site row.  Default: 0 (first cell on beginning of row is the starting point).   "\fB-insert_cells <list_of_cells>\fR" Inserts mixed well-taps, and supports the LUP layer and boundary layer rules.   "\fB-pitch <microns>\fR" Used with the -fixedGap parameter to give the software added flexibility to place well-tap cells if it is unable to place a cell at the specified location. If you specify this parameter, the software first tries to fit the well-tap cells in the locations specified by  -cellInterval, or forced by  -fixedGap; if it cannot do so, it adds well tap cells at the closest location allowed by this parameter.   "\fB-pitchOffset <microns>\fR" Used with the -fixedGap and  -pitch parameters to give the software greater flexibility. If you specify this parameter, the software first tries to fit the well-tap cells in the locations specified by  -cellInterval, or forced by  -fixedGap; if it cannot do so, it adds well tap cells at the closest location allowed by this parameter.   "\fB-powerDomain <powerDomainName>\fR" Specifies the power domain in which the well-tap cells are inserted. This is the area where the well-tap cells are placed and connected to the correct power and ground nets.   "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Specifies the prefix for the placed well-tap cells. The software adds an underscore and a unique string to the prefix, in the following format: prefix_<uniqueString>.  Prefix Default: WELLTAP  Note: Do not include an underscore when you specify a prefix.   "\fB-siteOffset <number_of_sites>\fR" Specifies an offset value, in number of sites, so that the vertical taps are aware of.    "\fB-skipRow <number>\fR" Specifies the number of rows to skip between two rows of an identical pattern.  Note: If you specify -checkerBoard, this parameter is ignored.  Default: 0 (No rows are skipped, so well-tap cells are added in the same pattern to every row)  "\fB-startRowNum <number>\fR" Specifies the row number starting from the from bottom or left side of the design on which the well-tap cells must be placed.  Default: 1 (first row from the bottom is the starting point)  "\fB-termination_cell <termination_cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of cells that can be used as termination taps.  addWellTap selects the best fit termination cells from this list and inserts them at the top and bottom of well tap column segment. The existing non-termination well taps are deleted as needed. If the well tap columns have already been terminated with a valid termination cell, the existing termination cell are kept in the incremental run and no changes are made.  Note: It is recommended that well tap columns are added before termination cell insertion.  Note: This parameter must be specified for termination tap cell insertion.  "\fB-top_termination_cell <cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of termination cells to be used at the top.   "\fB-vertical_boundary_spacing <spacing_with_well_tap>\fR" Specifies vertical boundary spacing with well tap. addWellTap will recognize all vertical boundaries and keep center of tap cells to these boundaries equal to or less than the specified distance when inserting.  Minimum: -1  Maximum: 1.79769313486232e+308  "\fB-wellCutCell list_of_well_cut_cells\fR" Specifies the list of cells with the well cuts.  The addWellTap -incremental flow treats cells specified in this list as placement blockage because they cut the row and fix the latch up violations within them. 
.SH Examples

.RS  "*" 2 The following commands place instances of well-tap cell xyz in a checkered pattern. The first instance in the odd row numbers (1, 3, 5, and so on) is placed at 0 (zero) offset. The first instance in even row numbers (2, 4, 6, and so on) is placed at 50 m offset. Instances in the same row are at least 45 m but no more than 100 m apart. Instances on the odd rows are named wtap_odd_1, wtap_odd_2, and so on. Instances on the even rows are named wtap_even_1, wtap_even_2, and so on.   addWellTap -cell xyz -prefix wtap_odd -cellInterval 100 -skipRow 1  addWellTap -cell xyz -prefix wtap_even -cellInterval 100 -skipRow 1 \\      -startRowNum 2 -inRowOffset 50
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places instances of well-tap cell WTAP on every row in the design.Before placing the instances, the software checks for cells named WTAP and PSO1, and if it finds any within the minimum gap (that is, 21.68 m from the nearest well-tap cell in that row) it does not place any instances in that area.   addWellTap -cell WTAP -incremental "WTAP PSO1"  "*" 2 In the following commands, cell TAP is specified as general well tap and TAP_TERMINATION is specified as termination well tap. TAP cells and tap columns are inserted first, followed by TAP_TERMINATION cells as termination cells at the top and bottom of each TAP column.   addWellTap -cell TAP -cellInterval 28  addWellTap -termination_cell TAP_TERMINATION -column_cell TAP  "*" 2  The following command places well tap cell xyz on both boundary layer region and dense layer region with different rules.  addWellTap -insert_cells { { xyz rule 22.5 boundary_layer B1 boundary_rule 5 } { xyz dense_layer D1 dense_rule 8 }}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
