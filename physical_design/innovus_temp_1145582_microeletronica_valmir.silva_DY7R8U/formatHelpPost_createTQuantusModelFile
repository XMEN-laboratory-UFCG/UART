.SH Name \fBcreateTQuantusModelFile\fR \-  Creates the RC model data and stores it in a TQuantus model file
.SH Syntax \fBcreateTQuantusModelFile\fR  [-help]  -file <rc_model_file_name>   [-reset]
.P Creates the RC model data and stores it in a TQuantus model file. This data is used by the RC extractor. This command eliminates the need for the RC extractor to rebuild the RC models every time it runs. It can just use the model data created using this command. Before creating the TQuantus model file, ensure the following:
.RS  "*" 2 QRC techfiles are available  "*" 2 Pitch information from the technology LEF file is available  "*" 2 All RC corners are set up
.RE
.P The consistency of the created TQuantus model file is checked using the checkTQuantusModelFile command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createTQuantusModelFile parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command  man createTQuantusModelFile.  "\fB-file <rc_model_file_name>\fR" Writes the created RC model data into a file with the specified file name.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets the RC model file.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates the RC model data and stores it in the tQuantus_model.bin file:  createTQuantusModelFile -file tQuantus_model.bin
