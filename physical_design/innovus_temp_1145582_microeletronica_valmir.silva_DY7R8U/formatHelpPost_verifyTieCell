.SH Name \fBverifyTieCell\fR \-  Checks tie cell connections. verifyTieCell honors the tie high/low cell list from setTieHiLoMode -cell and checks whether or not the tie high/low nets are connected to the tie high/low cells.  
.P Use this command after using addTieHiLo to add instances of tie-off cells to the logical hierarchy of the design
.SH Syntax \fBverifyTieCell\fR   [-help]   [-noTieCell <filename>]   [-powerDomain <string>]  [-report <filename>]
.P Checks tie cell connections. verifyTieCell honors the tie high/low cell list from setTieHiLoMode -cell and checks whether or not the tie high/low nets are connected to the tie high/low cells.  
.P Use this command after using addTieHiLo to add instances of tie-off cells to the logical hierarchy of the design.
.P The expected flow is as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 Specify the tie cell names and other settings with the setTieHiLoMode command.  "*" 2 Add tie high/low cells with addTieHiLo.  "*" 2 Run verifyTieCell to check whether tie cell connections are correct.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyTieCell parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man verifyTieCell  "\fB-noTieCell <filename>\fR" Specifies a file containing exception list of instance/pin names. Use this parameter to specify the instance/pins that should not have any tie cell connections.  The file should list instance and pin names in the following format:  <instance_name/pin_name>  "\fB-powerDomain <string>\fR" Specifies the power domain name to be checked.   "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the report file for recording tie cell violations. By default, the report is saved as <designName>.tie.rpt. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands check the tie cell to assess if TIEH and TIEL are inserted for tie nets. If the dontTouch instance does not have a tie cell, violation will not be detected:  setTieHiLoMode -cell {TIEH TIEL} -honorDontTouch true  verifyTieCell -report vtc.rpt  "*" 2 The following commands will check if inst or pin in inst.list has a tie cell. If it happens, a violation will be detected:  setTieHiLoMode -cell {TIEH TIEL}  verifyTieCell -noTieCell inst.list -report vtc.rpt
