.SH Name \fBdeletePGPin\fR \-  Deletes power/ground pins as per the specified parameters and reports the number of deleted power/ground pins. You can use this command at any point in the design flow
.SH Syntax \fBdeletePGPin\fR   [-help]   [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]  [-layer <layer_id> | {<list_of_layer>}]   [-net <net_name>]   [-pg_port]   [-all | -selected ]
.P Deletes power/ground pins as per the specified parameters and reports the number of deleted power/ground pins. You can use this command at any point in the design flow.
.P Note: The deletePGPin command only deletes the pin shapes and fterms created using the createPGPin command. If the power/ground pins are added using the loadFPlan command, then the deletePGPin command only deletes the pin shapes and keeps the pg pins.
.P If there is no power/ground pin and pin box definition in the
.fp.gz file, and you add the power/ground pins using the createPGPin command, then Innovus will automatically add the pg fterm for it. In such a case, the deletePGPin command deletes both pin shapes and pg pins. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-all\fR" Deletes all the power/ground pins.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-area <x1 y1 x2 y2>\fR" Specifies a bounding box for the area in which power/ground pins are to be deleted.  Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each deletePGPin parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man deletePGPin  "\fB-layer <layer_id> | {<list_of_layer>}\fR" Specifies the layer(s) on which the power/ground pins are to be deleted.  Note: Layers can be specified using the LEF layer names or layer ID numbers.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the net whose attached power/ground pins are to be deleted.  Data_type: (net)*, optional  "\fB-pg_port\fR" Deletes pg ports with pg shape or deletes pg ports based on the net name specified with the -net option.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-selected\fR" Deletes the selected power/ground pins.  Data_type: bool, optional
