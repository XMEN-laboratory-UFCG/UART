.SH Name \fBtiming_report_enable_clock_unrolling\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_report_enable_clock_unrolling\fR   {true | false} 
.P Default : false
.P Enables the clock unrolled reporting format that shows more intuitive timing reports with respect to constraints.
.P When set to true, the report_timing command provides an optional format where the clock edge arrival times in the detailed path section show the worst-case clock edge pair used for the analysis. This format can provide a more intuitive understanding of the clock edges used - especially in cases where the launch and capture clocks have different frequencies.
.P When set to false, the detailed path section shows clock edge arrival times with respect to the base cycle of the clocks. Any required cycle-accounting adjustments are provided by the Phase Shift and Cycle Adjustment entries in the timing report summary section.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
