.P This command fixes the following types of violations in special net vias: short, mincut, and minstep. If the via cannot be replaced, the violation marker is not removed. Use this command after running the verify_drc command. It only fix violations indicated by markers from verify_drc. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each fixVia parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man fixVia  "\fB-area {<x>1 <y>1 <x>2 <y>2}\fR" Specifies the rectangular area. Thus, the command applies to the violations within the area only. The area option should be compatible with all existing options and supports all violations that the command can support at the moment. Specifying the area improves the run-time for large design with significant number of violations.  x1, y1 are the coordinates for lower left corner of the area. x2, y2 are the coordinates for the upper right corner of the area.  By default, this option is off and with no default value for any of its argument.  "\fB-short\fR" Fixes vias which have a short violation.  "\fB-minCut\fR" Replaces power vias flagged by a violation marker due to a violation of the LEF MINIMUMCUT rule.   The via is replaced with a via that contains the minimum number of cuts based on the LEF rule, and the violation marker is removed.  "\fB-minStep\fR" Replaces power vias flagged by a violation marker due to a violation of the LEF MINIMUMSTEP rule.   The via is replaced with a via that contains the minimum number of steps based on the LEF rule, and the violation marker is removed.
