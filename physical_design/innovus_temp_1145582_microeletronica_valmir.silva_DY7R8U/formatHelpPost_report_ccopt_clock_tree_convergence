.SH Name \fBreport_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence\fR \-  This command is used to report a summary of the convergence above clock sinks and to identify the names of sinks with the highest number of clock path networks
.SH Syntax \fBreport_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence\fR  [-help]  [-file< fileName>] 
.P This command is used to report a summary of the convergence above clock sinks and to identify the names of sinks with the highest number of clock path networks.  If there are sinks with many paths leading to them, there can be a considerable impact on runtime. Reducing the complexity of the logic, or excluding sinks that need not have timing constraints from the clock trees can help improve runtime. An example of the report is shown below.
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P In the above sample report, 5 primary IOs have 1400 paths leading to them from the clock sources.The report also shows a table with the names of sinks with most paths leading to them. In the "Sinks with most paths leading to them" section of the report, the five sinks, Owest/nout[n], have 1400 paths leading to them. These sinks are likely to be problematic and need to be checked. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help       \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_ ccopt_clock_tree_convergence parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man report_ccopt_clock_tree_convergence.   "\fB-file <fileName>  \fR" Specifies the file name in which the report will be saved.
