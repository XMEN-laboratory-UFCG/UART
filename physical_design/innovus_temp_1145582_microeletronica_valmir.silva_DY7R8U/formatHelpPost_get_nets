.SH Name \fBget_nets\fR \-  Creates a collection of nets in the current design whose name matches the supplied pattern list
.SH Syntax \fBget_nets\fR  [-help]  [-hierarchical]   [-hsc <char>]   [-filter <expr>]  [-regexp]   [-nocase]   [-quiet]   [<patterns> | -of_objects <object_list>]  
.P Creates a collection of nets in the current design whose name matches the supplied pattern list. Assign this collection to a variable or pass it as an argument to an another command. If no such net is found, an empty collection is returned.
.P When you use the get_nets command to specify hierarchical nets, the software matches the specified pattern and returns the top level net connected to it. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression. For any nets that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the net.  You can filter nets using any of the net properties supported through the get_property command.  "\fB-hierarchical\fR" Specifies that the patterns should match hierarchically. If the hierarchical name of a net at any hierarchical level matches the patterns, it is included in the result.  "\fB-hsc <char>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical delimiter for patterns.  "\fB-nocase\fR" Specifies that pattern matching is not case sensitive.  Note: You must specify -regexp in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all nets associated with the specified cells, pins, or ports. You can specify a list of cells, a list of pins, or a list of ports, but you cannot specify a list that contains cells, pins, and ports together. You can specify patterns for the cell, pin, or port names, a collection of cells, pins, or ports, or a combination of patterns and a collection.  "\fB<patterns>\fR" Specifies patterns for net names. Patterns include the * and ? wildcard characters and collections of nets.  "\fB-quiet\fR" Suppresses all error and warning messages generated when the get_nets command is run.  "\fB-regexp\fR" Treats the specified patterns as regular expression patterns.  Default: Treats the specified pattern as wildcard
