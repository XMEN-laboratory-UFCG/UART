.SH Name \fBtiming_aocv_analysis_mode\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_aocv_analysis_mode\fR   {launch_capture | clock_only | separate_data_clock | combine_launch_capture}
.P Default: launch_capture
.P Controls handling of AOCV analysis modes.
.P When set to launch_capture, AOCV analysis will be performed for both data and clock paths, and the AOCV derating factor will be calculated based on both clock and data path stages.
.P When set to clock_only, AOCV analysis will be performed for clock paths only, and the AOCV derating factor will be calculated based on the clock path stage depth only.
.P When set to separate_data_clock, the software calculates the AOCV stage count for clock paths and data paths separately. Both clock and data paths have related AOCV derating factors.
.P When set to combine_launch_capture, the software calculates AOCV stage count using combined depth for launch and capture paths. This is achieved by summation of path depth on the launch and capture paths.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
