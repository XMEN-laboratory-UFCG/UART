.TH set_rail_analysis_domain  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_rail_analysis_domain\fR \-  Specifies a rail analysis power domain
.SH Syntax  \fBset_rail_analysis_domain\fR  [-help]   -name <domain_name>  -pwrnets <power_net>_list  -gndnets <ground_net_list>   [-threshold <value>] 
.P Specifies a rail analysis power domain.
.P Note: For a power-gated domain, you should only specify the "always on" net. The switched net should not be specified as part of power domain definition, because it is traced by the program automatically. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-gndnets <ground_net_list>\fR" Specifies a list of ground nets that are in the domain.  "\fB-help \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each set_rail_analysis_domain parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man set_rail_analysis_domain.  "\fB-name<domain_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the power domain.  "\fB-pwrnets<power_net_list>\fR" Specifies a list of power nets that are in the domain.  "\fB-threshold <value>\fR" Specifies the minimum allowed voltage on the power net or the maximum rise on the ground net, depending on the setting of the-voltage parameter. The -thresholdparameter is used to verify that the power grid passes the limit check and to set the filters for an IR plot.  Note: This parameter does not support domains with MSMV power nets.  If you have specified both net (set_pg_nets -threshold) and domain-based (set_rail_analysis_domain -threshold) thresholds, the net-based threshold will be honored.  The valid value for threshold is between 0 and 0.5 (50%). For example, set_rail_analysis_domain -threshold 0.1 indicates that 0.1 is 10% IRdrop. If a power net in the domain has nominal voltage of 1v, 10% of threshold will translate to 100mV of maximum effective IRdrop between the power and ground net. 
.SH Examples
