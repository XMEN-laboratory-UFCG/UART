.SH Name \fBtiming_report_pulse_width_matching_launch_capture_paths\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_report_pulse_width_matching_launch_capture_paths\fR {true | false}  
.P Default: false
.P Reports pulse width paths that have matching launch and capture paths - the count of pins and the pins must match exactly. The paths that do not meet this condition will not be reported.
.P When set to true, the software will impact the minimum pulse width report that is generated with the report_min_pulse_widthreport_min_pulse_width command along with the -path_type short and -path_type full_clock options.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
