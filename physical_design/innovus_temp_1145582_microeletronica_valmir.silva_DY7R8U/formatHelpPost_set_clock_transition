.TH set_clock_transition  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_clock_transition\fR \-  Specifies the slew time of register clock pins
.SH Syntax  \fBset_clock_transition\fR  [-rise]  [-fall]   [-min]  [-max]  [-min |-max]   <slew_time>  <clock_list> 
.P Specifies the slew time of register clock pins. This is useful for pre-layout static timing analysis before clock tree synthesis (CTS) is performed since net delays can be inaccurate with large fanout nets.
.P Use this command only with ideal clocks. In propagated mode, the software calculates slew times on register clock pins. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<clock_list>\fR" Specifies a list of clocks only with ideal mode in the design, which affects the slew times on all register clock pins in the transitive fanout of the specified clocks. Specified set_clock_transition values on register clock pins in the fanout of a clock with propagated latency are ignored.  "\fB-rise | -fall\fR" Specifies the rising or falling edge of the register clock pins on which the slew time is asserted.  "\fB-min | -max\fR" Specifies the clock slew time for minimum or maximum process corner slew time.  "\fB<slew_time>\fR" Specifies the slew time (transition time) of the clock pins. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands specify a 2.0 rise slew time and a 1.0 fall slew time for register clock pins clocked by CLKA: set_clock_transition -rise 2.0 [get_clocks CLKA] set_clock_transition -fall 1.0 [get_clocks CLKA]
