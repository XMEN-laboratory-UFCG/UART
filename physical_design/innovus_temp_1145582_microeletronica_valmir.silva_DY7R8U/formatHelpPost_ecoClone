.P Clones combinational logic if logic does not have any user constraints like don't size/touch and so on. This command is used when you want to clone combinational logic as manual ECO. It does not work for sequential logic like flops. The -from and -to parameters are used to specify the 'from' and 'to' pins for cloning. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ecoClone parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man ecoClone  "\fB-allow_sequential\fR" Used with -auto to try cloning at the sequential gates too.   "\fB-auto\fR" Applies cloning and buffering automatically. The software identifies and clones combinational logic based on critical endpoints distance-based clustering.   "\fB-balance <number>\fR" When specified, forces the number of loads on each clone to be within the specified number percentage (<num %>).  The default balance is 10%.  "\fB-cells <list_of_cells>\fR" Specifies the list of cells to use for the clones.  Note:
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 If this parameter is not specified, the clones have the same cell as the original gate.  "*" 2 If only one cell is specified in the list, all the clones are created with that cell.  "*" 2 If the -locs and -terms parameters are not specified, you can only specify one cell in that list.  "*" 2 If the -locs and/or -terms parameters are specified, you can also specify numClones cells, which is one cell for each clone.  "*" 2 It is not possible to specify a new cell for the original gate, so the original gate is not resized.
.RE 
.RE   "\fB-delete_buffer_trees\fR" When specified, the software attempts to delete buffer trees driven by instances to clone.  Note: The deletion of buffer trees with user constraints is skipped.  "\fB-dont_legalize\fR" When specified, the software may leave cloned instances overlapped with the original ones.  This means the software will not try to legalize instances. This means that if space is available, it will place legally, otherwise it will leave cloned instances overlapped with the original ones.  "\fB-dont_resize\fR" Specifies that neither the original nor the new (cloned) instances should be resized.    "\fB-force\fR" When specified, forces instance cloning, even if it worsens QoR or causes illegal placement.   "\fB-from <pin names>\fR" Specifies 'from' pins. You can specify a single pin or a list of pins.  "\fB-instances <instance names>  \fR" Specifies the instances to be cloned. You can specify a single instance or a tcl list of instances to be cloned.    "\fB-locs <list_of_locations>\fR" Specifies the location of each clone. This parameter is used along with the -numClones parameter. When this parameter is specified, a location should be specified for each clone, so the length should be numClones. The length can be numClones+1, in which case, the first location is used for the original gate. When the locations are specified, the sink partitions are assigned to the closest clone.  "\fB-loop <number>\fR" Repeat cloning at most <number> times, as far as new instances are being created. The original and new instances within the min/max number of loads range are valid targets at each iteration.  Default: 0 (means no limit)  "\fB-max_levels <integer>  \fR" Specifies the level of instances that the software needs to traverse for cloning. Zero value means the software will clone everything till the origin of logic.  Default: 0 (meaning infinite)  "\fB-max_num_loads <integer>\fR" Specifies that cloning should be skipped for instances driving more than the specified number of loads.  Default: 50000  "\fB-min_num_loads <integer>\fR" Specifies that cloning should be skipped for instances with less than or equal to the specified number of loads.  Note: The -min_num_loads and -numClones parameters are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-nets <list_of_nets>\fR" Specifies the nets to be cloned. You can specify a single net or a tcl list of nets to be cloned.   Note: The -nets and -instances parameters are mutually exclusive. Wildcards are allowed for this parameter.  "\fB-numClones <number>\fR" Specifies the number of clones to create. The default value is 0 and in that case, it is computed from the -min_num_loads parameter.  Note: The -min_num_loads and -numClones parameters are mutually exclusive.  Default: 0  "\fB-preview\fR" When specified, provides a preview of what would be done, while leaving the netlist untouched. This means that the software will report instances that will be cloned and the changes that will be applied to the netlist without actually changing the netlist.   "\fB-radius <number>\fR" Specifies that the clones should be placed within a radius of the specified number of rows from their preferred location based on the original instance location and the center of mass of the new set of loads.  Default: 10  "\fB-same_hier_only\fR" Specifies that only those loads will be considered that are in the same hierarchy as the driver.   "\fB-terms <list_of_term_lists>\fR" Specifies the partitions, so it is a list of term lists. This parameter is used along with the -numClones parameter.  When this parameter is specified, there should be one partition for each clone, so the length should be numClones. The terms that are not in any partition are assigned to the partition driven by the original gate. The length can be numClones+1, in which case the first partition is for the original gate. In that case, all the sinks should be in a partition.  "\fB-to <pin names>\fR" Specifies 'to' pins. You can specify a single pin or a list of pins.  "\fB-verbose\fR" When specified, verbose messages are displayed during the cloning of instances. 
.SH Example
.P The following command will clone logic till $to pins with more then 6 loads, while forciby deleting the buffer tree:
.P ecoClone -to $to -verbose  -min_num_loads 6 -delete_buffer_trees -force
