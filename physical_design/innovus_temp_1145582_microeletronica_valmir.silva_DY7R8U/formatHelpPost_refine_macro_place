.SH Name \fBrefine_macro_place\fR \-  Legalizes the macros based on constraints such as halo and blockages, forbidden spacing, min-space, etc
.SH Syntax \fBrefine_macro_place\fR  [-help]   [-verbose ] 
.P Legalizes the macros based on constraints such as halo and blockages, forbidden spacing, min-space, etc. To define the constraints of macros, use the set_macro_place_constraint command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each refine_macro_place parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man refine_macro_place  "\fB-verbose\fR" Writes the macro movement details to a tcl file.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command specifies the minimum space between macro-to-core boundary as 5 and the forbidden space between macro-to-core boundary as 2.  set_macro_place_constraint -forbidden_space_to_core 2 -min_space_to_core 5  refine_macro_place
