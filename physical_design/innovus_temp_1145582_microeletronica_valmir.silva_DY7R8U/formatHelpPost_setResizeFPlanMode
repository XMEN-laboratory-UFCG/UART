.P Controls certain aspects of how floorplan resizes the design. Use the getResizeFPlanModecommand to return the current settings for the setResizeFPlanMode command. The setResizeFPlanMode parameters affects the behavior the resizeFloorplan command. You can use this command after importing the design and before using the resizeFloorplan command. You can resize the space among floorplan objects in three ways - proportional spacing, shift-based spacing, or congestion-based spacing. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-congAware {true | false}\fR" Resizes and shifts the floorplan objects by estimating the congestion for the floorplan and automatically deciding where to draw a resize line to avoid the congested area.  Default: false  Data_type: bool  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setResizeFPlanMode parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setResizeFPlanMode.  "\fB-honorHalo {true | false}\fR" Honors placement halo and preserves the space between macros held by halo after the floorplan resize. With this option set to true, if the original placement halo does not overlap with other macros or placement halo, after resizeFP, it will not overlap with other macros or placement halo.  Default: true  Data_type: bool  "\fB-ioFix {true | false}\fR" Fixes I/Os at current location.  Default: false  Data_type: bool  "\fB-ioMoveWithEdge {true | false}\fR" Moves pins on the moved edge orthogonally to edge direction so pins stay on edge after movement. The pins on other edges are not touched.  Default: false  Data_type: bool  "\fB-ioProportional {true | false}\fR" Resizes the space among I/Os proportionally. If you set this parameter to true, the I/Os are distributed proportional to the original I/O space. If you set this parameter to false, the I/Os are distributed evenly.  Note: By default, the overlapping I/Os are spaced proportionally.  Default: true  Data_type: bool  "\fB-maintainResourceRatioAfterResize {true | false}\fR" When enabled, it maintains the resource ratio after resizeFloorplan in shift-based mode.  Default: false  Data_type: bool   "\fB-proportional {true | false}\fR" Resizes the space among floorplan objects proportionally.  Default: false  Data_type: bool  "\fB-reset\fR" Restores all parameters modified using setResizeFPlanMode to their default settings. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setResizeFPlanMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-shiftBased {true | false}\fR" Shifts floorplan objects at appropriate location(s) without changing the proportional spacing. You can specify resize lines to control the areas of floorplan that will be expanded or shrunk. To set resize lines, use the setResizeLinecommand. If you do not specify resize line(s), the floorplan is resized automatically - that is, the resize lines are derived automatically based on the current floorplan and the specified resize values.  Default: true  Data_type: bool  "\fB-shrinkFence {true | false}\fR" Enables resized lines to go through fences and regions in floorplan. With this option the resizeFloorplan command, automatically resizes fences, regions, and guides inside the floorplan while maintaining their minimum size after the shrink.  Default: false  Data_type: bool  "\fB-snapToTrack {true | false}\fR" Snaps resize values (shrink/expand) of the floorplan to a multiple integer of the metal layer pitch. For example, if the horizontal metal pitch is 1.568 microns and you want to shrink the floorplan by 8 microns in y direction, the actual shrink value is 7.84 microns, the nearest multiple integer of the metal pitch. The x direction resize value snaps to the first vertical layer pitch and the y direction resize value snaps to the first horizontal layer pitch.  Default: true  Data_type: bool
