.SH Name \fBdeleteFPObject\fR \-  Deletes the specified floorplan object by name. You can use the command at any point in the design flow
.SH Syntax \fBdeleteFPObject\fR   [-help]  objectType   objectName
.P Deletes the specified floorplan object by name. You can use the command at any point in the design flow. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each deleteFPObject parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man deleteFPObject  "\fB<objectName>\fR" Specifies the name of the object for the <objectType>. To get <objectName>, you can use <dbObjToName objPtr> where <objPtr> is the target object db pointer.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB<objectType>\fR" Specifies the type of object for the <objectName>. The object type can be any of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 Placement Blockage (LayerShape)  "*" 2 Partial Placement Blockage (LayerShape)  "*" 2 Routing Blockage (LayerShape)  "*" 2 Partition Feedthrough (PtnFeed)  "*" 2 Partition Pin Blockage (PtnPinBlk)
.RE   Data_type: string, required 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command deletes the placement blockage (658300,824180,874060,1048640) from the current design:  deleteFPObject LayerShape (658300,824180,874060,1048640)  Note: You can get  "objectName" by using [dbObjToName objPtr], where objPtr is the db pointer to the placement blockage object.  This is similar to,  deleteFPobject LayerShape [dbObjToName objPtr]  "*" 2 The following command deletes the Partial Placement Blockage from the current design:  deleteFPObject LayerShape (1079960,1006880,1211620,1111280)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes the Routing Blockage from the current design:  deleteFPObject LayerShape (628350,905550,857290,1057010)  "*" 2 The following command deletes the Partition Feedthrough from the current design:  deleteFPObject PtnFeed (980200,912920,1298040,954140)  "*" 2 The following command delete Partition Pin Blockage from the current design:  deleteFPObject PtnPinBlk (970780,947630,1007150,1012280)
