.SH Syntax \fBtiming_disable_internal_inout_net_arcs\fR  {true | false}  Default: true
.P When set to true, this global disables internal bidirectional feedback paths that span multiple instances.
.P When set to false, this global enables internal bidirectional feedback paths, which are feedback paths that you might not want to use during analysis and optimization.
