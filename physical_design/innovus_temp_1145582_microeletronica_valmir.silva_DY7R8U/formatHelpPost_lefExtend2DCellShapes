.P Type: String
.P Default: ""
.P Specifies a list of layer and a value for creating obs shape for 2D pin/obs shapes. Cells could have 2D objects, which require larger line-end spacing. You can use lefExtend2DCellShapes to automatically add SPACING 0 OBS  for routing during LEF in..
.P For any 2D shapes, you can extend edges that are perpendicular to the preferred routing direction of the rectilinear shape by specifying the extension_amount in lefExtend2DCellShapes.
.P Note: Cells would still require explicit edge constraint to prevent improper cell abutment. 
.SH Example
.P set lefExtend2DCellShapes {M1 0.1}
.P The direction of M1 is Vertical.
