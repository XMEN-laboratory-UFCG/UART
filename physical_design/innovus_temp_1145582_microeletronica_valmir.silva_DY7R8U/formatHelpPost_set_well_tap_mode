.P Controls the behavior of addWellTap command. The mode setting is persistent and saved along with the database by the saveDesigncommand. Use get_well_tap_mode to return the current settings for set_well_tap_mode command. 
.P Note: Parameters specified by the addWellTap command supersede those specified by the set_well_tap_mode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each set_well_tap_mode parameter.    For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man set_well_tap_mode.  "\fB-avoid_vertical_well_abutment {none|ntap|ptap|all_tap}\fR" Specifies which type of well-tap cells to be forbidden from the vertical abutment.  Default: none  "\fB-avoidAbutment {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether the inserted taps should avoid horizontal and vertical abutment.  Default: false  "\fB-block_boundary_only {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether to insert termination tap cells only for well tap columns on the block boundary. Default is false, termination cells are inserted on both core boundary row and block boundary row.  Note: This parameter works only when inserting termination cells.  "\fB-bottom_tap_cell <cellName>\fR" Specifies well taps inserted into bottom rows during enclosed end cap insertion.  Note: This parameter must be specified when 'setEndCapMode -boundary_tap true'.  "\fB-bottom_termination_cell <cellList>\fR" Specifies the list of bottom termination cells to be used.  Default: ""  "\fB-cell \fR" Specifies the name of the cell in the technology library to use as a well-tap. The cell should be of class type CORE.  Default: ""  "\fB-channel_offset <offset_value>\fR" Specifies the offset value between taps and blockage in channel.  Default: 0  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 1.79769313486232e+308  "\fB-check_channel {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether the blockage channel will be checked.   "\fB-column_cell <cellist>\fR" Specifies the list of well tap columns that need to be terminated. This parameter must be specified for termination tap cell insertion.   "\fB-create_rows {true|false}\fR" Creates rows for welltap cell techSites which do not have rows in the floorplan.  Default: false  "\fB-disable_check_zone_at_boundary {none|vdd|vss|both}\fR" Disables the check zone at boundary.  Default: none  "\fB-inRowOffset <offset_value>\fR" Specifies the distance between the first welltap in a row and the start of the row.  Default: 0 (first cell in beginning of row is the starting point)  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 1.79769313486232e+308  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified options to the default value.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-insert_cells <cellName rule dense_layer dense__rule boundary_layer boundary_rule>\fR" Inserts well-taps based on cell, layer, and interval.
.RS  "*" 2 cellName: Specifies the cell name.  "*" 2 rule: Cell with this rule would be added as a general tap cell for all placeable area. The center to center spacing of tap cells would be  (2*$rule) without -checkerBoard and  (4*$rule) with -checkerBoard.    Note: Center of the tap cell is used to check the spacing.  "*" 2 <dense_layername>: Specifies the dense layer name.  "*" 2 dense_rule: Cell with dense layer would be added to the given layer regions only. Cell with dense layer must follow the dense rule. The center to center spacing of dense tap cells would be  (2*$dense_rule) without -checkerBoard and  (4 *$dense_rule) with -checkerBoard.  "*" 2 <boundary_layername>: Specifies the boundary layer name.   "*" 2 boundary_rule: A cell would be added for boundaries inside the given layer regions. The cell must follow the boundary rule. The spacing between the boundary to the center of boundary tap cells would be  $ boundary rule. Boundary layer regions which cover partial sites should be extended. Boundary taps can be located in or out of boundary layer regions.
.RE   Note:
.RS  "*" 2 You can define multiple cells for -insert_cells by separating each cell by { }.  "*" 2 There should be at lest one rule, dense layer or boundary layer, defined for each cell.  "*" 2 The order of tap cell insertion is:
.RE
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 Dense tap  "*" 2 Boundary tap  "*" 2 General tap
.RE 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2  If the area is covered by both dense layer region and boundary layer region, both layer rules must be satisfied.  "*" 2  If -insert_cells is defined multiple times, the last setting is accepted by the tool.  "*" 2 If -insert_cells is defined, you do not need define -rule while using the verifyWellTap command.
.RE   "\fB-rule \fR" Specifies the rule to be honored when adding well taps.   "\fB-siteOffset <number_of_sites>\fR" Specifies an offset value, in number of sites, so that the vertical taps are aware of.    "\fB-tap_function_cells <cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of tap function cells to be used.  Default: ""  "\fB-tap_termination_alignment {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether to align well-taps and termination cells.  Default: false  "\fB-termination_align {left|right|center}\fR" Specifies the termination cell alignment.  Default: left  "\fB-termination_cell <cellList>\fR" Specifies the list of cells that can be used as termination taps. The command addWellTapselects the best fit termination cells from this list and inserts them at the top and bottom of well tap column segment. The existing non-termination well taps are deleted as needed. If the well tap columns have already been terminated with a valid termination cell, the existing termination cell are kept in the incremental run and no changes are made.  Note: It is recommended that well tap columns are added before termination cell insertion.  Note: This parameter must be specified for termination tap cell insertion.  "\fB-top_tap_cell <cellName>\fR" Specifies well taps inserted into top rows during enclosed end cap insertion.  Note: This parameter must be specified when setEndCapMode -boundary_tap is set to  true.   "\fB-top_termination_cell <cellList>\fR" Specifies the list of top termination cells to be used.  Default: ""  "\fB-vertical_boundary_spacing <spacing_with_well_tap>\fR" Specifies the spacing between center of tap cell and vertical boundary  Default: -1  Minimum: -1  Maximum: 1.79769313486232e+308  "\fB-well_cut_cell <cellist>\fR" Specifies the list of cells with the well cuts. addWellTap considers the specified cells cutting the row.
