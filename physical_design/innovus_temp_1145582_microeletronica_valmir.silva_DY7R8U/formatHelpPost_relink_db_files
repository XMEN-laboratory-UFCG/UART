.SH Name \fBrelink_db_files\fR \-  Relinks symbolic links to library files inside a DB directory
.SH Syntax \fBrelink_db_files\fR    [-help]    -db_dir <db_directory>   -new_lib_dirs {<new_lib_directory1> <new_lib_directory2>
...}
.P Relinks symbolic links to library files inside a DB directory.
.P By default, saveDesign saves the location of library files as symbolic links under <db_dir>/libs/.... When a DB directory is copied to a new network where all the libraries are in a different location, or a new version of the library files are needed, you can use relink_db_files to change the symbolic links to new locations
.
.P The relink_db_files command will search each -new_lib_dirs directory and the sub-directory tree below it for each library file name inside <db_dir>, and create a symbolic link to the new location. Only the base file name is used for the search (except for qrcTechFile). Therefore, two path names inside the new directory, such as /timing/fast/std.lib and /timing/slow/std.lib, will have duplicate names of std.lib. The duplicate names are not supported and will cause an error. You can use the restoreDesign command to update all the LEF full-path names or use a new MMMC files with all the new
.lib full-path names if duplicate file names need to be updated. If there are missing library file names, the tool will show an error. 
.P The relink_db_files command supports
.lib,
.lef, and qrcTechFile library file types. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each relink_db_files parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:    man relink_db_files  "\fB-db_dir <db_directory>  \fR" The current db directory which contains incorrect library symbolic links.   "\fB-new_lib_dirs<{new_lib_directory1 new_lib_directory2
...}>\fR" The new directories to search for library files. 
.SH Example
.P If the current LEF files are all under/libs/lefs_v1.0/ (or sub-directories) and the current
.lib and qrcTechFiles are all under/libs/timing_v1.0/ (or sub-directories), you use the following command to update the LEF files to use /libs/lefs_v2.0/:
.P >relink_db_files -db_dir my_db -new_lib_dirs {/libs/lefs_v2.0 /libs/timing_v1.0}
.P Note: The command must find every library file. Therefore, you need to list the top of the old timing directory tree along with the top of the new LEF files directory tree.
