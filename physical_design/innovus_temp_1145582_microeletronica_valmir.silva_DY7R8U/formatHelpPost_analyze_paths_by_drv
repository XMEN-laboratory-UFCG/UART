.SH Name \fBanalyze_paths_by_drv\fR \-  Reads or generates a report containing max transition, max capacitance, and max fanout violations
.SH Syntax \fBanalyze_paths_by_drv\fR  [-help]  [[-load_cap_file <capacitance_file>] | [-generate_cap_file <fileName>]]  [[-load_tran_file <transition_file>] | [-generate_tran_file <fileName>]]  [-load_fanout_file <fanout_file> | [-generate_fanout_file <fileName>]]  [-master <master_category_name>] 
.P Reads or generates a report containing max transition, max capacitance, and max fanout violations. Paths that are affected by the selected DRV type are grouped into a category. This command can be used if the user wants to debug the timing issues caused by DRV.
.P The command can be applied wherever the user loads the machine readable timing report.
.P For more information on creating path categories, see "Creating Path Categories" in the Debugging Timing Results chapter of User Guide. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help                  \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each analyze_paths_by_drv parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man analyze_paths_by_drv  "\fB-load_cap_file <capacitance_file>\fR" Reads a file containing a list of paths containing max capacitance violations.  "\fB-load_fanout_file <fanout_file>\fR" Reads a file containing a list of paths containing max fanout violations.  "\fB-load_tran_file <transition_file>\fR" Reads a file containing a list of paths containing max transition violations.  "\fB-generate_cap_file <fileName>\fR" Generates a file containing a list of paths containing max capacitance violations.  "\fB-generate_fanout_file <fileName>\fR" Generates a file containing a list of paths containing max fanout violations.  "\fB-generate_tran_file <fileName>\fR" Generates a file containing a list of paths containing max transition violations.  "\fB-master <master_category_name>\fR" Specifies that the analysis should be performed only for the specified master category. 
.SH Examples:
.P The following command generates DRV report files, then creates path categories based on the critical paths which are affected by DRV:
.P analyze_paths_by_drv -generate_cap_file capViolation.rpt
.P -generate_tran_file tranViolation.rpt
.P -generate_fanout_file fanoutViolation.rpt
