.SH Name \fBrestoreDesign\fR \-  Restores a saved database created by saveDesign in a previous session. It auto-detects the database type and loads it
.SH Syntax \fBrestoreDesign\fR  [-help]  [<design>]   [-dynamic_view <analysis_view>]  [-hold_views <hold_views>]  [-leakage_view <analysis_view>]  [-noBinaryConstraint]   [-noTiming]  [-readGlobals <tcl_file>]  [-setup_views <setup_views>]  [{{<session>} | {-cellview <lib cell view>}} [-mmmcFile <fileName>] [-lef_files <list_of_files>]]  [-noTimingGraph] 
.P Restores a saved database created by saveDesign in a previous session. It auto-detects the database type and loads it. An OpenAccess DB format is restored with -cellview {<lib> <cell> <view>} while a native Innovus DB format is read using <<session>> <design> for the DB directory name.
.P saveDesign optionally includes various types of data, including timing-graph data, RC extraction data. So, the state of the DB after restoreDesign depends on what was saved, and you may need to repeat RC extraction, timing analysis, etc. if that data was not saved.
.P If a design is saved with the newer Innovus version and you try to load the design in an older Innovus version, the tool will give an error and stop. The "older Innovus version" refers to the main version, such as 19.1 and 20.1.  The second number after decimal does not make any difference. For example, if a design is saved in 20.12 and loaded in 20.11, it will not give any error and will work properly.
.P For OpenAccess usage, simple digital-only designs generally go back and forth with no special handling. But some types of Virtuoso custom data cannot be represented directly in the Innovus DB and are stored on the side by restoreDesign and geometrically equivalent data is visible in Innovus. That data is then restored by saveDesign when you write back to OA using the correct OA settings. 
.P There are different types of OA methodologies and flows supported that are controlled by setOaxMode. You can also look at the Mixed Signal Interoperability Guide for more details on their effects on saveDesign/restoreDesign.
.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 Innovus does not support loading another DB while a design is already in memory.  "*" 2  You should not modify the contents of a saved DB (*.enc.dat or *.db) at any time. If the contents of the saved DB are modified, restoring such modified DB might cause problems later or lead to DB corruption or crashes.

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each restoreDesign parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man restoreDesign  "\fB-cellview <lib cell view>\fR" Specifies the library name, cell name, and view name for reading an OpenAccess DB design.  "\fB<design>\fR" Specifies the top cell of the design saved in the <session> directory. If you specify any arbitrary cell name as the top cell name, the tool will automatically search the top cell name in DB directory.  "\fB-dynamic_view <analysis_view>\fR" Specifies the analysis view for the dynamic power analysis.  "\fB-hold_views <hold_views>\fR" Specifies the hold views for loading, rather than the hold views active during saveDesign.   "\fB-leakage_view <analysis_view>\fR" Specifies the analysis view for leakage power analysis.  "\fB-lef_files <list_of_files>\fR" Specifies the LEF files name for loading. Use this option if you want to replace the existing LEF files in the design with new LEF files instead.
.RS  "*" 2 This option is intended to allow upgrading to new versions of LEF files that are compatible with the old versions. The list of all LEF files used by this design must be given.  "*" 2 If any pin locations or cell boundaries or OBS shapes are changed for used cells, new DRC violations may occur.  "*" 2 If pins are added or removed from used cells, or used cells are removed, fatal errors may occur when loading the netlist.  "*" 2 If the removed pins and cells are unused in the design, warnings or errors may still occur if any library-specific data was stored for those cells or pins during the design flow (for example, dont_touch data)
.RE   Example   Existing LEFs used by saveDesign: tech.lef, A.lef  You can change A.lef to A_v2.lef as given below:   restoreDesign place.enc.dat top -lef_files {tech.lef A_v2.lef}  "\fB-noBinaryConstraint\fR" Specifies not to load the binary timing constraint
.tcz file even it is saved to disk in the previous session.   "\fB-noTimingGraph\fR" Skips reading the timing graph even if it was saved to the disk by saveDesign.   "\fB-mmmcFile\fR" Specifies the path name to a Multi-Mode/Multi-Corner (MMMC) configuration file (for example, the same file format used by init_mmmc_file) to replace the MMMC file saved by saveDesign (and all the corresponding
.lib files,
.sdc files, *_power_constraints.tcl etc. referenced by the MMMC file).  If a new MMMC file is specified using -mmmcFile, the RC data saved by the previous session may mismatch with the new MMMC file and cause issues. If restoreDesign -mmmcFile is specified, by default, the tool will not load the RC data. You need to re-extract RC after the design is loaded.  Note: CCOpt configuration will not be restored with -mmmcFile specified. You need to re-run create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec after restoreDesign to create a new CCOpt configuration against the new MMMC configuration.     "\fB-noTiming\fR" Skips reading the MMMC file, timing libraries, and timing constraints.  Note: Most designs that use LEF rely on the
.lib information to define the bus order for MACROs that have bus bit terminals. Therefore, using the -noTiming option can result in the connectivity to bus ports of leaf level instances being reversed. When
.lib information is not available, the default is for bus ports to be treated as descending (for example, [7:0]). When using Verilog modules or OpenAccess abstract views to define the bus order, the connectivity will still be correct even when -noTiming is specified.   Timing libraries cannot be loaded in the same session after a design is read using the -noTiming option. You must use restoreDesign without the -noTiming option in a new session to load the design with timing libraries and constraints.   If you save a design after restoreDesign -noTiming, it will not save timing information unless you use saveDesign -addtiming.  "\fB-readGlobals <tcl_file>\fR" Specifies the UDM variables to be honored when restoring the design. You need to provide a Tcl file stating the pre-defined UDM variable names to be honored.    "\fB<session>\fR" Specifies the directory from which to load the DB files. If the <<session>> name ends with
.tar.gz it is treated as a gzipped tar file (see saveDesign -tgz option) that is extracted into the directory first.  So, restoreDesign test.enc.dat.tar.gz will create a directory named test with all the DB files inside it.   "\fB-setup_views <setup_views>\fR" Specifies the setup views for loading. Rather than the setup views active during saveDesign. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command loads the saved design files from the test.enc.dat directory:   restoreDesign test.enc.dat top  "*" 2 For physical-only editing, you can do this to speedup restoreDesign/saveDesign by ignoring the timing during restoreDesign, and adding it back during saveDesign.   restoreDesign test1.enc.dat top -noTiming  <physical-only editing>  saveDesign test2.enc.dat -addtiming  Then in a new session  restoreDesign test2.enc.dat top     #has timing from test1.enc.dat  If the logical netlist was modified during editing of test1.enc.dat, then reading test2.enc.dat may have unpredictable timing results.   "*" 2 The following command reads the "designLib top placed" OpenAccess cellview but replaces the existing MMMC settings in the design with the settings in new_mmmc.tcl:   restoreDesign -cellview "designLib top placed" -mmmcFile new_mmmc.tcl
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reads the placed.enc.dat design but replaces the saved MMMC settings in the design with the settings in new_mmmc.tcl:   restoreDesign placed.enc.dat -mmmcFile new_mmmc.tcl  Then create a new CCOpt configuration:  create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec
