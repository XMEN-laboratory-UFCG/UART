.SH Name \fBwrite_generalized_feedthru_paths\fR \-  Automatically derives feedthrough topological paths from the user specified paths to cover all the chain connectivity probabilities in a master and clone hinst scenario
.SH Syntax \fBwrite_generalized_feedthru_paths\fR  [-help]  [-dont_generalize_reverse_paths]   [-dont_generalize_sub_paths]   [-topological_out_file <file_name>]   -use_topological_file <file_name> 
.P Automatically derives feedthrough topological paths from the user specified paths to cover all the chain connectivity probabilities in a master and clone hinst scenario. It reads an input topological file, in version 0.5 and creates the version 2.0 topological file. 
.P Note: For the given set of master-clone hinst connectivity, based on floorplan, multiple user defined paths may be required for other same set hinst master and clones. The write_generalized_feedthru_paths command can automatically choose correct path for individual master and clone hinst, based on matching connectivity and floorplan, from the set of paths provided by the user. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-dont_generalize_reverse_paths\fR" When enabled, the generalization algorithm does not generalize reverse chain paths.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-dont_generalize_sub_paths\fR" When enabled, the generalization algorithm does not generalize sub-paths.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each write_generalized_feedthru_paths parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man write_generalized_feedthru_paths  "\fB-topological_out_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the output topo 2.0 file that contains all paths for all master and clone chain.  Note: This file should be used as an input file for the insertPtnFeedthrough command.   Default: path.topo  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-use_topological_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the user specified feedthrough path guidance file. The input topological file with new version 0.5 format contains a path for one master and clone chain to derive path of all master and clone chains.  Note: You can use the Path Guidance GUI form (Partition - Feedthough Ports - Path Guidance) to generate the topological file with new version 0.5 format.  Data_type: string, required 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reads the topology file a.topo in version 0.5 and creates the version 2.0 topological file path.topo:  write_generalized_feedthru_paths  -use_topological_file a.topo  "*" 2 The following command reads the topological file a.topo in version 0.5 and creates the version 2.0 topological file new.topo:  write_generalized_feedthru_paths  -use_topological_file a.topo -topological_out_file new.topo
