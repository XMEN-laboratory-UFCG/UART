.SH Name \fBset_inst_temperature_file\fR \-  Specifies the instance temperature file to support thermal-aware leakage
.SH Syntax  \fBset_inst_temperature_file\fR  <file>  [-reset] 
.P Specifies the instance temperature file to support thermal-aware leakage. You can use this command to do thermal-aware power calculation. Based on the temperature specified in the file, the software will calculate temperature and leakage power.
.P In the presence of a trilib set, the internal and leakage power will be interpolated as the per the given temperature specification. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<file>\fR" Specifies the name of the instance temperature file..  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets the temperature file.
