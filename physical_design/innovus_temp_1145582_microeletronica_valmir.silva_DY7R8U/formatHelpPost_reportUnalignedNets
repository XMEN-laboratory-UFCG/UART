.SH Name \fBreportUnalignedNets\fR \-  Reports the names of the nets where the pins are not aligned
.SH Syntax \fBreportUnalignedNets\fR  [-help]  [-alignDistance <distance>]  [-alignFeedThruPins]   [-considerMacroPinWithinDistance <distance>]  [-ignoreLength <length>]  [-noHighlight]   [-reportAllWithinChannelWidth <width>]  [-rptFile <filename>]  [-statistics]  [-steinerBox]  [-verbose]  [[ -ptnToPtn {aligned unaligned layerMismatch samePtn nonNbr multiFanout all unplaced none} ]   [ -topToPtn {aligned unaligned layerMismatch samePtn nonNbr multiFanout all unplaced none} ]]   [-pin_file <filename>| -exclude_pin_file <filename>]  
.P Reports the names of the nets where the pins are not aligned. It reports the nets in the following cases:
.RS  "*" 2 nets that have two pins on two different partitions and/or clones and are not connected to top level hard-macro, standard cell, or I/O.  "*" 2 nets that have two pins that are connected to the same partition.  "*" 2 nets that have one pin connected to top level hard-macro, standard cell, or I/O and the other pin connected to a partition or a clone.
.RE
.P Notes:
.RS  "*" 2 The nets reported by this command are also highlighted in the artwork window.  "*" 2 The assignPtnPin command internally calls the reportUnalignedNets command to generate the summary report at the command line.  "*" 2 The reportUnalignedNets command measures the average misalignment with standard deviation for multi-partition nets.  "*" 2 The reportUnalignedNets command detects and reports pins that are placed on non-facing edges.
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-alignDistance <distance>  \fR" Specifies the distance, in microns, up to which the pins are assumed to be aligned. With this parameter specified, the reportUnalignedNets command assumes that the pins are aligned within the specified distance even though they are not physically aligned.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-alignFeedThruPins  \fR" Reports the deviation of partition pins from chain's source-target box.   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-considerMacroPinWithinDistance <distance>  \fR" Reports nets connected to macro-pin which are within specified distance from nearest partition boundary.  Default: 3 microns  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-exclude_pin_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the pin list to be excluded for a partition in a file. In the pin file, the pins and nets are specified in the following format:  Partition: <PtnName/BlockName> <Pin1> <Pin2> <..> <PinN>   Partition:< PtnName/BlockName> <Pin1> <Pin2> <..> <PinN>  Nets:<><netA><netB
..netN>  Note: While specifying the pin list in the pin_file, it is necessary to give the Partition keyword followed by the name of the partition or block. If this is not specified, no operations are performed.  You can specify multiple partitions in the same pin_file. The pin_file does not support buses or wild cards for pin names. If a pin specified in the list or a partition is not present in the design, a warning is displayed.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportUnalignedNets command parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man reportUnalignedNets  "\fB-ignoreLength <length>\fR" Specifies the length, in microns. It ignores the nets from checking unalignment whose length is greater the specified length value.  Default: 5000  These ignored nets will be reported in the ignored category in the output report file.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-steinerBox \fR" Report the deviation of partition pins from the connectivity box of the partition.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noHighlight  \fR" Disables the highlight capability.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-rptFile <fileName>\fR" Specifies an output report file.  Note: Default name for report file is <designName>_unaligned.rpt  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-ptnToPtn {aligned | unaligned | layermismatch | sameptn  |nonnbr  | multifanout | all | unplaced | none}\fR" Reports nets that have two pins on two different partitions and/or clones and are not connected to top level hard-macro, standard cell, or I/O.
.RS  "*" 2 aligned: Reports nets that have aligned pins.  "*" 2 all: Reports all categories of unaligned pins.  "*" 2 layermismatch: Reports nets that have pins at an aligned location but different layers.  "*" 2 multiFanout: Reports nets that have multiple fanouts  "*" 2 none: Disables reporting of nets.  "*" 2 nonnbr: Reports nets that have two pins on two different partitions that are not adjacent.  "*" 2 sameptn: Reports nets that have two pins that are connected to the same partition.  "*" 2 unaligned: Reports nets that have unaligned pins.  "*" 2 unplaced: Reports nets that have unplaced pins.
.RE   Data_type: (enum)+, optional  "\fB-pin_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the pin list for a partition in a file. In the pin file, the pins and nets are specified in the following format:  Partition: <PtnName/BlockName> <Pin1> <Pin2> <..> <PinN>   Partition:< PtnName/BlockName> <Pin1> <Pin2> <..> <PinN>  Nets:<><netA><netB
..netN>  Note: While specifying the pin list in the pin_file, it is necessary to give the Partition keyword followed by the name of the partition or block. If this is not specified, no operations are performed.  You can specify multiple partitions in the same pin_file. The pin_file does not support buses or wild cards for pin names. If a pin specified in the list or a partition is not present in the design, a warning is displayed.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-reportAllWithinChannelWidth <width>\fR" Reports all the unaligned nets within the specified channel width even if the -ignoreLength parameter has been specified.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-statistics\fR" Reports average misalignment with standard deviation and layer difference count for aligned, layer mismatched, and unaligned ptnToPtn 2-pin nets of partitions. It is also used for reporting pin QOR.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-topToPtn {aligned | unaligned | layermismatch | sameptn  |nonnbr  | multifanout | all | unplaced | none}\fR" Reports nets that have one pin connected to top level hard-macro, standard cell, or I/O and the other pin connected to a partition or a clone.
.RS  "*" 2 aligned: Reports nets that have aligned pins.  "*" 2 all: Reports all categories of unaligned pins.  "*" 2 layerMismatch: Reports nets that have pins at an aligned location but different layers.  "*" 2 multiFanout: Reports nets that have multiple fanouts  "*" 2 none: Disables reporting of nets.  "*" 2 nonNbr: Reports nets that have two pins on two different partitions that are not adjacent.  "*" 2 samePtn: Reports nets that have two pins that are connected to the same partition.  "*" 2 unaligned: Reports nets that have unaligned pins.  "*" 2 unplaced: Reports nets that have unplaced pins.
.RE   Data_type: (enum)+, optional  "\fB-verbose\fR" Reports all categories in log file. By default, this parameter is not enabled and only the nets that have unaligned pins are reported in the log file.  Note: There will be no change in the report file with use of verbose parameter.  Data_type: bool, optional

.SH Example
.P The following command reports all nets which are placed in a channel equal to or narrower than 7.5 microns irrespective of the -ignoreLength parameter.  reportUnalignedNets -ptnToPtn unaligned -rptFile a -ignoreLength 10.0 -reportAllWithinChannelWidth 7.5
.P The following command creates an a.out report file:  reportUnalignedNets rptFile a.out -noHighlight -ptnToPtn all -topToPtn all  A summary of the reported unaligned nets displays on the Innovus console and in the Innovus log file.  The following is a sample of the resulting a.out report file.  ###############################################################  #  Generated by:      Cadence Innovus  #  OS:                     Linux x86_64(Host ID nofclo110)  #  Generated on:      Wed Feb 27 16:50:02 2013  #  Design:                NESTED_TOP  #  Command:           reportUnalignedNets -ptnToPtn all -topToPtn all -rptFi...  ###############################################################  ====================  Net Specific report:  ====================  pin_i_TOP_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[3] | nested-2-pin | aligned 3/4  pin_i_A1__A2forPorts_BB_[3] (I_K2/I_K2) | pin_i_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[3] (I_K2) | ptnToPtn | aligned  pin_i_A2forPorts_BB_[3] (I_K2/I_K2/I_K2) | pin_i_A1__A2forPorts_BB_[3] (I_K2/I_K2) | ptnToPtn | aligned  input_bus[3] (I_K2/I_K2/I_K2/I_A2_K4/BBOX) | pin_i_A2forPorts_BB_[3] (I_K2/I_K2/I_K2) | ptnToPtn | aligned  pin_i_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[3] (I_K2) | pin_i_TOP_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[3] (NESTED_TOP) | topToPtn | unaligned  pin_i_TOP_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[2] | nested-2-pin | aligned 1/4  pin_i_A2forPorts_BB_[2] (I_K2/I_K2/I_K2) | pin_i_A1__A2forPorts_BB_[2] (I_K2/I_K2) | ptnToPtn | aligned  pin_i_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[2] (I_K2) | pin_i_TOP_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[2] (NESTED_TOP) | topToPtn | unaligned  pin_i_A1__A2forPorts_BB_[2] (I_K2/I_K2) | pin_i_A0__A1__A2forPorts_BB_[2] (I_K2) | ptnToPtn | unaligned  input_bus[2] (I_K2/I_K2/I_K2/I_A2_K4/BBOX) | pin_i_A2forPorts_BB_[2] (I_K2/I_K2/I_K2) | ptnToPtn | unaligned
