.SH Name \fBhighlight_timing_report\fR \-  This command  enables you to highlight a specific number of paths in Global Timing Debug through user interface
.SH Syntax 
.SH \fBhighlight_timing_report\fR       [-help]  [-append]  [-color_index <integer>]  [-file <filename> ]   [-noarrow]   [-path <path_number>| -all]
.P This command  enables you to highlight a specific number of paths in Global Timing Debug through user interface. The input timing report must be in a machine readable format that is understood by Global Timing Debug. For more information, see the Debugging Timing Results chapter of the Innovus User Guide document. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each highlight_timing_report parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man highlight_timing_report  "\fB-all\fR" Highlights all the path in the Global Timing Debug through the user interface.   "\fB-append\fR" Appends a path to the current highlight.   "\fB-color_index <integer>\fR" Specifies the path's color index on a scale of 1 to 8.   "\fB-file <filename>\fR" Reads the machine readable file and also specifies the name of the file. The option is of type string and is optional.  "\fB-noarrow\fR" Removes the highlighted arrow.

It is recommended to use positive integers for specifying the <path_number>. 
.SH Example
.P The following commands generate the worst 1000 paths to a machine readable report, and then highlight the top five paths in Global Timing Debug:
.P report_timing -machine_readable -max_points 1000 > foo.mtarpt   load_timing_debug_report foo.mtarpt   highlight_timing_report -file foo.mtarpt -path "1 2 3 4 5" -noarrow
