.SH Name \fBdbEdge\fR \-  Returns the edges of a polygon of a shape along with the direction list (N, S, E, W and NE, NW, SE, SW)
.SH Syntax \fBdbEdge\fR  [-clockwise | -counterclockwise]  [{<shapelist>} [-direction <direction>] [-d]]  [-index <index_number>]
.P Returns the edges of a polygon of a shape along with the direction list (N, S, E, W and NE, NW, SE, SW). This helps you identify not only all the edges but also the direction in which the edges are pointing. At a time you can observe one polygon with 'n' number of points. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each dbedge parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man dbEdge   "\fB-clockwise\fR" Sorts the returned list of edges clockwise.   "\fB-counterclockwise\fR" Sorts the returned list of edges counterclockwise.   "\fB-direction {N S E W NE NW SE SW}\fR" Returns the edges of a polygon of a shape along with the direction list (N, S, E, W and NE, NW, SE, SW). It can also be a list. For example:  dbEdge -direction {N S NW NE} {10 20 30 40}  If the -direction parameter is not used, all the directions in the shape will be returned.  "\fB-d\fR" Returns user-specified values in database units.   Default: All values are in user units, in microns.  "\fB-index <index_number>\fR" Specifies the index number of the edge to be returned. The index number starts with 0 as the first edge specified in the shape list, and increases gradually along with the shape list. This number may range from  0 to ' <number_of_edges> - 1'.   "\fB{shapelist}\fR" Can be a rectangle like {llx lly urx ury} or a polygon like   {{x1 y1}{x2 y2}{x3 y3}.....}. Only one rectangle or polygon is accepted. This is a mandatory parameter.  Examples  Using a simple L-shape polygon  set shape_list {{0 0} {2 0} {2 1} {1 1} {1 2} {0 2}}
.RS  "*" 2 All edges  dbEdge $shape_list  {{S{0 0}{2 0}} {E{2 0}{2 1}} {N{2 1}{1 1}} {E{1 1}{1 2}} {N{1 2}{0 2}} {W{0 2}{0 0}}}  "*" 2 Only E facing edges  dbEdge -direction E $shape_list  {{E{2 0} {2 1}} {E{1 1} {1 2}}}
.RE   The format of the output is  {{<direction> <edge_vertex_1> <edge_vertex_2 }....}   Note: The polygon must be rectilinear. Otherwise, the following error occurs:  set bad_shape_list {{0 0} {2 0} {2 1} {1 1} {1 2}}  dbEdge $bad_shape_list  **ERROR: (IMPDBTCL-621): The slope of the edge { {1 2} {0 0} } does not match any of the standard directions {N | S | E | W | NE | NW | SE | SW}.
