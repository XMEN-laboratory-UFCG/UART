.SH Name \fBdeleteWhatIfTimingAssertions\fR \-  Removes the timing arc specifications of the specified blackbox or blackblob
.SH Syntax  \fBdeleteWhatIfTimingAssertions\fR  [<blackBoxCellName>]   [-port <portName> | -from <port> -to <port> | -from <port> | -to <port>]   [-assertion_type {comb | setup | hold}]   [-rising | -falling] 
.P Removes the timing arc specifications of the specified blackbox or blackblob. When you use this command, the Innovus software restores the timing arcs of the initial library.
.P You can use this command after the module definition of the blackbox or the blackblob is available with the I/O's in the Verilog netlist.
.P Note: You can delete the internal pin and the generated clock created by the createWhatIfInternalGeneratedClock command by specifying the -port parameter of this command. However, the clock and the pin will not be deleted if you use the -from <port>, -from <port> -to <port>, or the assertion_type parameters. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<blackBoxCellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the blackbox or blackblob cell. If you do not specify this parameter, all timing arc specifications are removed.  "\fB-port <portName>\fR" Specifies the name of one or more ports.  "\fB-falling\fR" Specifies that timing arcs should be deleted for falling clock transitions.  "\fB-from <port> -to <port>\fR" Specifies that all arcs starting from the port specified with -from and ending at the port.specified with -to.will be deleted.  Note: Any constraints specified with the -assertion_type parameter and the -rising parameter will be applicable.  Note: The deletion of a timing arc using the -from and/or -to parameter does not delete the what-if driver assertion on the output ports.  "\fB-from <port>\fR" Specifies that all arcs starting from the port specified with -from will be deleted.  Note: Any constraints specified with the -assertion_type parameter and the -rising parameter will be applicable.  "\fB-rising\fR" Specifies that timing arcs should be deleted for rising clock transitions.  "\fB-to <port>\fR" Specifies that all arcs ending at the port.specified with -to.will be deleted.  Note: Any constraints specified with the -assertion_type parameter and the -rising parameter will be applicable.  "\fB-assertion_type {comb | setup | hold}\fR" Specifies whether the timing arcs should be deleted for rising clock transitions or for falling clock transitions.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, timing arcs are deleted for both rising and falling clock transitions.
