.SH Name \fBshow_ccopt_cell_name_info\fR \-  Returns the list of cell name codes. All new cell instances created by CCOpt have an identifying code in their name to let you determine why that cell was created
.SH Syntax \fBshow_ccopt_cell_name_info\fR    [-help]
.P Returns the list of cell name codes. All new cell instances created by CCOpt have an identifying code in their name to let you determine why that cell was created. This command lists all available codes and their meanings. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description for the show_ccopt_cell_name_info parameter. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man show_ccopt_cell_name_info 
.SH Example 
.RS  "*" 2  The following command returns a list of all available codes and their meanings:   show_ccopt_cell_name_info  Creators:    CTSG Unnamed - this should not be used any more.   cuk Cts: Unknown creator, will not appear in the netlist.   ccl_a Cts: Created during clustering by the agglom clustering algorithm.   cbi Cts: Created by the swapping buffers and inverters for power.   cex Cts: Existing cells in the clock tree which cannot be removed.   coi Cts: Cells created as a result of cancelling out inversions   lbl Cts: Created by the clustering process to meet the slew target   ccl Cts: Created by the clustering process to meet the slew target   ccd Cts: Created by clustering for balancing the tree - these cells are not necessary to meet the slew target.   cci Cts: Created by the clustering process to fix inversion.   csf Cts: Created by the CTS slew fixing step in cases where clustering did not meet the slew target.   cms Cts: Created during the process of physically moving clock gates to improve their enable timing.   cid Cts: Created by CTS on the outputs of weak driving cells to reduce insertion delay.   cdb Cts: Created by CTS to balance the delays in the clock tree.   cdbw Cts: Created by CTS to balance the delays in the clock tree.   cwb Cts: Created by CTS to balance the wire delays in the clock tree.   cfo Cts: Created by CTS to reduce fanout skew.   csk Cts: Created by the CTS skew fixing step to finely balance the clock tree.   cmf Cts: Created by CTS to buffer long nets.   cbc Cts: Created by the clock tree conditioning step to clone off sub trees that cannot optimized by gated synthesis, such as those parts above RAMs, black boxes, and lockup latches.   css Cts: Created by the early cloning of simple sink allocations.   cdc Cts: A clock driver created by adding driver cell process for property add_driver_cell.   cpd Cts: A clock driver created below an input port or above an output port specified by property add_port_driver.   ccg Cts: A clock gate created by one of the gated synthesis algorithms.   cse Cts: A clock driver created above exclude pins to remove them from the clock tree.   cfh Cts: A clock driver created as part of a flexible H-tree.   cat Cts: Created by the add_clock_tree_source_group_roots command   cpc_drv Cts: A clock driver created by post conditioning.   cpc_sk Cts: A clock driver created by post conditioning.   PRO Post-route optimization.   PRO_drv Post-route optimization.   PRO_sk Post-route optimization.   sfc Cloned by slew fixing.   ccc Cts: Created by the clone_clock_cells command.   grb Cts: A clock driver created by global route buffering.   sgb Cts: A clock driver created by source group balancing.   idc Cloned to reduce insertion delay   vgb Cts: A clock driver created by VG buffering.   USK skewClock   cff Cts: A clock driver created by fanout fixing.
