.SH Name \fBearlyGlobalRoute\fR \-  Early Global Route (earlyGlobalRoute) is a quick global routing for estimating routing-related  congestion and parasitic (resistance and capacitance) values
.SH Syntax \fBearlyGlobalRoute\fR  [-help]  
.P Early Global Route (earlyGlobalRoute) is a quick global routing for estimating routing-related  congestion and parasitic (resistance and capacitance) values. The Early Global Route results are also used for pin assignment when you commit partitions in hierarchical designs. Early Global Route does not guarantee DRC-clean routing results. Do not perform signal integrity analysis on a design that has been routed using Early Global Route, because these routes are only used to estimate parasitic values for timing analysis. Route designs with the NanoRoute router if you want to perform signal integrity analysis.
.P Wire overlap can occur if a gcell is only partially covered by a routing blockage or pre-routed wires. Overlapping of non-default rule wires can also occur during track assignment; however, this information is modeled when the router estimates congestion. You can use the earlyGlobalRoute command after running placement. If the design uses additional placement features, such as clock tree synthesis and scan groups, use the command after running these placement features. If you have run IPO commands on your design, you must run the earlyGlobalRoute command to update interconnections for the design.
.P Notes: 
.RS  "*" 2 You can set the global parameters for the Early Global Route program by using the setRouteMode command. Parameters that you specify with setRouteMode are then used automatically whenever you run Early Global Route, either explicitly through the earlyGlobalRoute command or internally during in-place optimization, partitioning, or placement.  "*" 2 The assignPtnPin command reports the number of guide pins from route guides and fixed pins. Since earlyGlobalRoute chooses guide points provided by assignPtnPin to lay wires on partition boundary, the earlyGlobalRoute report clearly differentiates between fixed pins and the pins which are in the pin guide.  "*" 2 The Early Global Router supports nested partitions. The partitions specified with the setRouteMode -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorFence and the setRouteMode -earlyGlobalRoutePartitionHonorPin parameters are routed in the style that honors fence and pin constraints. All other partitions are still routed flat.  "*" 2 The Early Global Router supports get_metric APIs and enables you to query existing routing metrics at command line. To enable this capability, routeDesign just calls the 'get_metrics' API after generating the routing metrics.  "*" 2 If bus guides have been created in the GUI, the earlyGlobalRoute command honors the bus guides automatically.  "*" 2 The earlyGlobalRoute command honors multiple-CPU setting for track assignment inside earlyGlobalRoute by default.  "*" 2 The Early Global Router supports blackboxes by default. It internally calls the assignPtnPin command and places and routes all unplaced blackbox pins.   "*" 2 The Early Global Router supports uses two-row-height gcells with congestion modelling improvement for the technology nodes whose row-height is smaller than 7 track. It uses 2x2 gcell size as default for small default gcell size (<=7). By default, it checks for the number of tracks rather than checking the technology of the design to grow gcell size.  Note: This enhancement is designed only for N7 designs as these designs have less than 7 tracks. If an N7 design has more than 7 tracks then these setting will not be applied in order to ensure a better congestion accuracy.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each earlyGlobalRoute parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:    man earlyGlobalRoute.
