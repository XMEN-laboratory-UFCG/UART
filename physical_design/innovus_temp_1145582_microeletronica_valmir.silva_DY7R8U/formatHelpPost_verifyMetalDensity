.SH Name \fBverifyMetalDensity\fR \-  Checks the metal density of each routing layer and of macros against values specified by setMetalFill, by LEF file, or against its own internal default values
.SH Syntax   \fBverifyMetalDensity\fR   [-help]   [-report filename]   [-detailed]   [-ignoreLEFDensity]   [-layer <layer_name_list>]   [-area {x1 y1 x2 y2}]   [-oversize value] 
.P Checks the metal density of each routing layer and of macros against values specified by setMetalFill, by LEF file, or against its own internal default values. Reports density information in the log file.    Note: The setMetalFill command is a user-override command that provides constraints at the run time for each session. These constraints have precedence over the LEF/database values. For example, if you specify setMetalFill  -iterationName default, verifyMetalDensity checks against the default value.
.P If neither the LEF file nor setMetalFill specifies the window size or density, verifyMetalDensity uses internal default values.
.P verifyMetalDensity now supports multi-threading to improve Metal Fill runtime performance in multi-thread mode. verifyMetalDensity supports the new setMultiCpuUsage command use model. For more information, see the following documents:

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyMetalDensity parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man  verifyMetalDensity  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the area to verify. For example, verifyMetalDensity -area {0 0 100 100}.   Default: Entire area  Behavior of verifyMetalDensity -area with external metal density  When metal fill is added to a block design the external metal density provides a density assumption to verifyMetalDensity. The external density is used only for density calculation purposes and no fill shapes are added outside of the design area.  When the -area parameter is not specified, the external density value is not used. In this case, the verifyMetalDensity window is pushed back if it extends outside the design area, as shown in the figure below.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   If the -area parameter is specified and is larger than the design size then verifyMetalFill windows extend outside of the block area and use the external density value (see setMetalFill external density value specification) for that area.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   If external density is less than the specified preferred density, it is more likely that shapes will be added to the area. If external density is greater than the preferred density it is less likely that shapes will be added (shapes are only added within the design boundary).  Note: Windows outside the design boundary are ignored.  "\fB-detailed\fR" Generates a detailed metal density report.  "\fB-ignoreLEFDensity\fR" Ignores the MACRO DENSITY table in the LEF file and instead uses the default macro density calculation method.  Note: If you do not specify this parameter, verifyMetalDensity uses the LEF MACRO density table for density calculations.  "\fB-layer <layer_name_list>\fR" Specifies the LEF or Innovus layers to verify. If you specify only one layer name, you do not need the braces around the name. For example, verifyMetalDensity -layer  {METAL1 METAL2}.  "\fB-oversize <value>\fR" Specifies an offset value for the area to verify. The value is in user units (not in DBU), and can be positive or negative. A positive value adds to the area that is verified. For example, if the design covers the area from (0,0) to (100,100) and you specify -oversize   10, verifyMetalDensity checks the area from ( -10,-10) to (110,110).  Default: 0.  "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the report file for the metal density violation information.  Default: <designName>.metaldensity.rpt. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks metal density of all layers and generates a report file named Test7.density.rpt:  verifyMetalDensity -report Test7.density.rpt
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks metal density on layer Metal1 in the area specified and generates a detailed report named test_chip.density.rpt:   verifyMetalDensity -area {-200 -200 1600.0 1600.0} -layer {Metal1} -report test_chip.density.rpt -detailed   In the example above, the layout size is 0 0 1400.0 1400.0. The command considers the density of the area outside of the design as 0.
