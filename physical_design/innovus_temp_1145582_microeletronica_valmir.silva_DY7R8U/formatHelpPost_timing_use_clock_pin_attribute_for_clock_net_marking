.TH timing_use_clock_pin_attribute_for_clock_net_marking  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_use_clock_pin_attribute_for_clock_net_marking\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_use_clock_pin_attribute_for_clock_net_marking\fR   {true | false}
.P Default: false
.P Allows the software to use clock pin attribute settings for clock net marking.
.P The timing system determines which nets are recognized as clock nets by considering different heuristics - including having an upstream path to clock sources and a downstream path to clock targets.
.P When set to true, the pins that have the Liberty timing library pin attribute setting 'clock:true' will be interpreted as additional clock targets for the clock marking algorithm.
.P When set to false, the set of clock targets includes pins that are the launching point for sequential paths or are the reference pin for sequential timing checks - typically register clock pins.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
