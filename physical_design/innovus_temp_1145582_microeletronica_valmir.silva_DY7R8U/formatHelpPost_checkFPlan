.SH Name \fBcheckFPlan\fR \-  Checks the quality of the floorplan to detect potential problems before the design is passed on to other tools
.SH Syntax \fBcheckFPlan\fR    [-help]   [-outFile <fileName>]  [-reportUtil]  
.P Checks the quality of the floorplan to detect potential problems before the design is passed on to other tools. This highlights the cells in the design display area with violation markers, where applicable. Use this command after specifying the floorplan data or running an initial floorplan. Run checkFPlan on your final floorplan file.
.P Notes:  
.RS  "*" 2 Parameters that you specify with the setFPlanMode command are used automatically whenever you run the checkFPlan command.  "*" 2 Innovus honors the FinFET grid and automatically checks for the FinFET definition. If it detects a FinFET definition it enables support and sets the placement grid as FinFET grid by default. Since the height of all placeable objects must be a multiple of FinFET grid and the origin of these objects must be snapped to the FinFET grid. The checkFPlan command checks if all the supported objects (die box, core box, standard cell rows, I/O rows, blocks, IO pads, and standard cells) are aligned with FinFET grid and reports DRC violations.   "*" 2 The checkFPlan command can check if the row's orientation is correct according to related tech site's SYMMETRY definition. It flags when Y SYMMETRY is missing from techlef CORE site definition.  "*" 2 The checkFPlan command checks the pin snapping result.
.RS  "*" 2 For min width pins, it checks whether the pin center is snapped to the routing track with the same color.   "*" 2 For fat pins, it checks whether the pin center is snapped to the routing track and decides if the pin center should snap to the same or opposite colored routing track.
.RE  "*" 2 The checkFPlan command checks if power stripes are on routing track for 10nm DPT layers (Metal1, Metal2, Metal3). It also checks power vias upper and lower metal shapes if they are not entirely covered by other power stripes on the same layers. Additionally it also checks if multi-height rows conflict with PG rails. In case of a conflict, a violation is reported.  "*" 2 You can use the checkFPlan command to check if there are any existing overlaps between group boxes and power domain boxes as the box for a group should not physically overlap with the box for a power domain.
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each checkFPlan parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man checkFPlan  "\fB-outFile <fileName>  \fR" Outputs detailed information for the specified checks.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-reportUtil\fR" Reports target utilization (TU) and effective utilization (EU) for the entire design, fences, and regions (partitions, power domains, and regular fences).  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks the floorplan and writes the detailed information to the details.txt file. It also reports the final core utilization:  checkFPlan -outFile details.txt -reportUtil
