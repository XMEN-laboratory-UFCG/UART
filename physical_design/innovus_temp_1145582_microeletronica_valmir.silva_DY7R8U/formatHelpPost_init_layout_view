.P Default: NULL
.P Specifies the list of OpenAccess view names to be processed for cell layout viewing (GDSII equivalent). This global variable replaces the previous rda_Input(ui_oa_layoutname) configuration file variable.
.P The init_layout_view global is also used in the case where a Verilog netlist is read and views from the init_layout_view list are used in the Quick Abstract Inference flow to derive abstract information from layout views for cells that were not processed from the libraries in the init_oa_ref_lib list. It is used by the init_design command. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies LAY3 as the layout view to be imported.   set init_layout_view {LAY3}
