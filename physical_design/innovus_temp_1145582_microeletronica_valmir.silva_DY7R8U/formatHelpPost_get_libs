.SH Name \fBget_libs\fR
.SH Syntax \fBget_libs\fR  [-help]  [-filter <expr>]  [-quiet]  [-regexp]   [-nocase]   {-of_objects <object_list> | <pattern_list>} 
.P Creates a collection of loaded libraries whose name matches those specified in the pattern list. Assign these libraries to a variable or pass them to another command. If no objects match the criteria, an empty collection is returned. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression. For any libraries that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the library.  You can filter libraries using any of the library properties supported through the get_property command.  "\fB-nocase\fR" Specifies that pattern matching is not case sensitive.  Note: You must specify -regexp in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of libraries that belong to the library cells in a given object list.  "\fB<pattern_list>\fR" Returns only those libraries in the collection whose name matches one or more of the patterns specified in the <pattern_list> argument. The characters ? and * are wild cards; The ? character matches any one character while the * character matches zero or more characters. If a library matches multiple patterns, it appears multiple times in the collection.  "\fB-quiet\fR" Suppresses all error and warning messages generated when the get_lib_cells command is run.   "\fB-regexp\fR" Treats the specified patterns as a regular expression patterns.  Default: Treats the specified pattern as a wild card
