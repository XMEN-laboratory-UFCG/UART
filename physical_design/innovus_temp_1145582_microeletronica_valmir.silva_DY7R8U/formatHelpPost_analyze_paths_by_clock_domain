.TH analyze_paths_by_clock_domain  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBanalyze_paths_by_clock_domain\fR \-  To find the possible timing issues in clock combinations, the command creates categories according to launch clocks - capture clocks combinations
.SH Syntax \fBanalyze_paths_by_clock_domain\fR  [-help]  [-include_edges]  [-include_views]  [-include_mode]  [-master <master_category_name>] 
.P To find the possible timing issues in clock combinations, the command creates categories according to launch clocks - capture clocks combinations.
.P Following categories are created:
.RS  "*" 2 Paths with clock fully contained in a single domain, clk1.  "*" 2 Paths with clocks starting one clock domain and ending at another, clk1-> clk2.
.RE
.P The command can be applied wherever the user loads the machine readable timing report by the load_timing_debug_report command.
.P For more information on creating path categories, see "Creating Path Categories" in the Debugging Timing Results chapter of User Guide. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each analyze_paths_by_clock_domain parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man analyze_paths_by_clock_domain  "\fB-include_edges\fR" Considers leading or trailing edge of the clock while defining categories.  "\fB-include_mode\fR" Considers constraint mode while defining categories.  "\fB-include_views                      \fR" Considers analysis views while defining categories.  "\fB-master <master_category_name>\fR" Specifies that the analysis should be performed only for the specified master category. 
.SH Examples:
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates path categories based on clock domain analysis of the critical paths , and considers the edges of the clock:   analyze_paths_by_clock_domain  -include_edges
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates path categories based on clock domain analysis of the critical paths , and considers the analysis views:   analyze_paths_by_clock_domain  -include_views
