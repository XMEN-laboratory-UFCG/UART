.TH saveOaBlackboxes  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsaveOaBlackboxes\fR \-  Saves the specified blackbox abstracts, using the OpenAccess database format. You can use the saveOaBlackboxes command at any time after importing the design. 
.P Note that when the design is saved using the saveDesign command, the tool automatically saves abstracts for any blackboxes in the design
.SH Syntax \fBsaveOaBlackboxes\fR  [-help]  -cell <list_of_cells>  -lib <libName>  [-view <viewName>]  
.P Saves the specified blackbox abstracts, using the OpenAccess database format. You can use the saveOaBlackboxes command at any time after importing the design. 
.P Note that when the design is saved using the saveDesign command, the tool automatically saves abstracts for any blackboxes in the design. However, if you are performing pin optimization or manipulating the blockages on a particular macro in the design, you may wish to save the abstract for only that particular macro. The saveOaBlackboxes command is useful in such situations. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each saveOaBlackboxes parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man  saveOaBlackboxes  "\fB-cell <list_of_cells>\fR" Specifies one or more blackboxes to save. If you specify more than one blackbox, you must enclose them in either double quotation marks or curly braces, and separate them with an empty space.  "\fB-lib <libName>\fR" Specifies the OpenAccess library to use to save the blackbox abstracts. If an OpenAccess library with the same name already exists, the software creates a cell view in that library.  If the library does not exist, the software creates the library in the working directory, with the library name and the path name being the same. If a new library is created, the technology file is copied from the technology library to the new library.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Specifies the cell view to save.  Default: Uses the view name abstract
