.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_genclk_edge_based_source_latency\fR \-  Controls how the software chooses generated clock source latency paths
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_enable_genclk_edge_based_source_latency\fR  {true | false}  Default: true
.P Controls how the software chooses generated clock source latency paths. Certain specifications of the create_generated_clockcreate_generated_clock  constraint imply a cause-and-effect relationship between the edges of the master clock and those of the generated clock. 
.P When set to true, the software checks whether a path being analyzed has the correct cause-effect relationship consistent with the specified constraint. Paths that are found to be inconsistent are ignored. Only the paths that are in agreement with the required edge relationship are considered for source latency. If no such path exists, the software uses a source latency of 0 ns. This selection is done independently for each edge of the generated clock; therefore the result might be different for each edge.
.P The edge-to-edge sufficiency checks are performed assuming a Rise-to-Rise, Rise-to-Fall relationship between the master clock and the generated clock with an even number -divide_by factor. For the odd -divide_by factors, the sufficiency check is performed assuming a Rise-to-Rise, Fall-to-Fall relationship. The sufficiency checking is not performed for -multiply_by options. 
.P When set to false, the software does not check paths for the correct cause-effect relationship. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
