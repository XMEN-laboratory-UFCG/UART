.SH Name \fBtiming_set_scaling_for_negative_delays\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_set_scaling_for_negative_delays\fR  {default | divider | multiplier} 
.P Default: default
.P Modifies the scaling of the negative delay value to be used during timing analysis. This variable does not affect the positive delay.
.P When set to default, the derated check/delay = negative check/delay * (2.0 - derating factor), where the derating factor is the value that you set using the set_timing_derate command.
.P When set to divider, divides the negative delay value by the derating factor. When set to multiplier, multiplies the negative delay value by the derating factor.
.P Currently, constraints are used during timing in the flattened mode, so the internal ILM instances are seen instead of the LEF pins of the ILMs. Therefore, reading the bounding box constraints causes errors without this variable set. Notice that if you want to see the LEF pins of the ILM in GUI, the design must be in the unflattened mode.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
