.SH Name \fBattachIOBuffer\fR \-  Adds buffers/inverters to the I/O pins of a block and places the buffers/inverters near the I/O pins
.SH Syntax \fBattachIOBuffer\fR  [-help]   [-baseName <baseName>]  [-dishonorUpfDomainBoundaryCheckForIsoLsStrategy]   [-excNetFile <excNetFileName>]   [-excludeClockNet]   [-port]   [-prePlace]  [-selNetFile <selNetFileName>]   [-skipRefinePlace]  [-suffix <suffixName>]  {[-in <cellNameList>] [-out <cellNameList>]}   [-status {placed fixed softfixed}]
.P Adds buffers/inverters to the I/O pins of a block and places the buffers/inverters near the I/O pins. When a top-level input (output) is connected to a power domain other than the default, the added buffer is matched to the hierarchy of the destination (source) cell and placed inside the power domain.
.P This command is power-domain aware. To take advantage of this feature when the netlist contains level shifters, load the shifter table before running this command.
.P Through the -port and -suffix parameters, you can control the instance and net names created when you use attachIOBuffer.
.P You can use this command after loading a design. Use the -status fixed parameter before you run place_design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each attachIOBuffer parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the  man  command:    man attachIOBuffer  "\fB-baseName <baseName>\fR" Specifies the base name of the new nets. For nets with the same base name, you should consider the hierarchical index and add 1. For example, if there are several nets with an abc base name, ending on abc98, then the first new net with the same base name is abc99.  Example: attachIOBuffer -baseName buf -in BUFX4  Before：  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After：  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-dishonorUpfDomainBoundaryCheckForIsoLsStrategy\fR" Dishonors power-domain boundary check for isolation/level-shifter instances.   "\fB-excludeClockNet\fR" Does not connect the buffer on clock nets. You must trigger the clock net markings prior to running attachIOBuffer, with the timeDesign command. To query whether a given clock net is marked, use dbIsNetClock <netName>.  "\fB-excNetFile <excNetFileName>\fR" Specifies the file that contains the names of nets to exclude from the buffer attachment operation.  "\fB-in <cellNameList>\fR" Specifies the cell name or a list of cell names of the input (-in) buffer. If the specified cell is an inverter, then the attachIOBuffer command inserts an inverter pair.  Note: If the -in and -out parameters are specified together, both input and output pins will be attached buffers/inverters. If only -in (or -out) option is specified, then only input (or output) pins will be attached buffer. If a list of cells is specified, it will insert the first CPF compliant cell. It is recommended to give non-AO buffers/inverters before AO buffers/inverters in the list.  "\fB-out <cellNameList>\fR" Specifies the cell name or a list of cell names of the output (-out) buffer. If the specified cell is an inverter, then the attachIOBuffer command inserts an inverter pair.  Note: If the -in and -out parameters are specified together, both input and output pins will be attached buffers/inverters. If only -in (or -out) option is specified, then only input (or output) pins will be attached buffer. If a list of cells is specified, it will insert the first CPF compliant cell. It is recommended to give non-AO buffers/inverters before AO buffers/inverters in the list.  "\fB-port\fR" Prepends the port name to the name of the net or instance created.  Example: attachIOBuffer -in BUFX4 -port  Before：  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  After：  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-prePlace\fR" Specifies to legally place the inverter connected to the port and to leave the other inverter unplaced.  Example: attachIOBuffer -in INVX2 -prePlace  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-selNetFile <selNetFileName>\fR" Specifies the file that contains the names of nets to include in the buffer attachment operation.  "\fB-skipRefinePlace\fR" Skips legalization of the new buffer/inverter (incremental placement needs to be run later to legalize it).   "\fB-status {placed fixed softfixed}\fR" Specifies the placement status of the added buffer as placed/fixed/softfixed.   "\fB-suffix <suffixName>\fR" Appends a string to name of the net or instance created. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command attaches buffers bufx4 to the I/O pins. The new nets have a basename of abc:   attachIOBuffer -baseName abc -in bufx4
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command prepends the port name and appends the _buf string to the name of the instance and net created by attachIOBuffer:   attachIOBuffer -port -suffix "buf"  Resulting instance name:  port1_I_buf  Resulting net name:  port1_N_buf
