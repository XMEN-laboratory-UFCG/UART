.TH timing_extract_model_aocv_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_extract_model_aocv_mode\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_extract_model_aocv_mode\fR        {graph_based | path_based | none}
.P Default: none
.P Allows you to specify AOCV derating mode.
.P The valid values are:
.RS  "*" 2 graph_based: Specifies that the delays in the timing model are derated using the graph-based stage counts.  "*" 2 path_based: Specifies that the delays in the timing model are derated using the total path stage count of worst path between those pin pairs.  "*" 2 none: Specifies that the delays in the timing model are non-AOCV derated base delays.
.RE
.P Note: Before setting this global to graph_based or path_based mode, it is mandatory that the AOCV libraries are read in and AOCV analysis is enabled (by setting set_analysis_mode -aocv true).
