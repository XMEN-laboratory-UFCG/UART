.TH create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBcreate_ccopt_clock_tree_spec\fR \-  Creates a clock tree network with associated skew groups and other clock tree synthesis (CTS) configuration settings such as ignore pins, case analysis, maxTrans, and so on based on a multi-mode timing configuration in the common timing engine (CTE)
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_ccopt_clock_tree_spec\fR   [-help]    [-file <filename>]  [-keep_all_sdc_clocks]    [-views <viewList>]
.P Creates a clock tree network with associated skew groups and other clock tree synthesis (CTS) configuration settings such as ignore pins, case analysis, maxTrans, and so on based on a multi-mode timing configuration in the common timing engine (CTE).
.P When you run this command, one skew group will be created for each SDC clock in each constraint mode. Each such skew group will be able to take a skew target from any delay corner, but will have this target set to ignore unless there is an active analysis view that links the constraint mode for the skew group to that delay corner. The output of this command is a sequence of Innovus Tcl commands that can be edited manually. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help        \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec.  "\fB-file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name for the clock tree specification script file.  Providing the filename writes out the specified file. The file is not executed. To execute the file, run the following:  create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec -file spec.tcl  source spec.tcl  Note: You can execute the file only once. If you run the above again, the software gives an error message:  source spec.tcl  Cannot run clock tree spec: clock trees are already defined.  The already loaded specification file can be removed by using either of the following commands:
.RS  "*" 2 delete_ccopt_clock_tree_spec  "*" 2 reset_ccopt_config
.RE   Note: If this parameter is not specified, the clock trees are defined by directly running clock tree extraction without the creation of a clock tree extraction script.  "\fB-keep_all_sdc_clocks\fR" Specifies that all clocks and clock trees should be kept in 1:1 ratio, wherever possible.  This means that CCOpt will maintain generated clock names for clock trees, even where these are functionally redundant, for example, clocks defined on buffer outputs. By default, CCOpt will not define these redundant clock trees.  "\fB-views <viewList>\fR" Specifies the Tcl list of analysis view names. By default, the software considers all active analysis views. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2  The following example shows how running create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec defines clock trees by directly running clock tree extraction instead of creating a clock tree extraction script:   get_ccopt_clock_trees *      create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec    get_ccopt_clock_trees *      m_clk m_digit_clk m_dsram_clk m_ram_clk m_rcc_clk m_spi_clk refclk<1> refclk
