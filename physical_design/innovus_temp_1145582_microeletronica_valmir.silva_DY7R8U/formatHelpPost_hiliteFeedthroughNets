.TH hiliteFeedthroughNets  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBhiliteFeedthroughNets\fR \-  Highlights all nets for which feedthrough buffers were inserted with the insertPtnFeedthrough command
.SH Syntax \fBhiliteFeedthroughNets\fR  [-help]  <fileName>  [<netNameList> ] 
.P Highlights all nets for which feedthrough buffers were inserted with the insertPtnFeedthrough command. The highlighted feedthrough path consists of the nets, the terms that the nets connect to, and the instances that contain those terms.
.P Note: For the hiliteFeedthroughNets to work, the insertPtnFeedthrough command must be run with the -netMapping parameter. The net mapping file generated with the insertPtnFeedthrough -netMapping parameter is used by the hiliteFeedthroughNets command to highlight the feedthrough nets.
.P To dehighlight the feedthrough nets, run the dehighlight command.
.P Note: It displays a warning message when used for a design with nested partitions and generates results based on single level partitions. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the net mapping file that was generated with the insertPtnFeedthrough -netMapping parameter.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each hiliteFeedthroughNets parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man hiliteFeedthroughNets  "\fB<netNameList>\fR" Specifies the name of the net(s) whose feedthrough path should be highlighted.  Default: The feedthrough paths of all nets specified in the net mapping file are highlighted.  Data_type: string, optional
