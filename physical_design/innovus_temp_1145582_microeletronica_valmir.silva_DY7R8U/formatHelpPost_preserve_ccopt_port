.SH Name \fBpreserve_ccopt_port\fR \-  This command preserves module ports for the flexible h-tree feature. It can be used on any module port in the clock tree
.SH Syntax \fBpreserve_ccopt_port\fR  [-help]  {[<portname> [-location {x y} | -reset ]] | -reset_all  | [-list  [-file <filename>]] | -tcl_list}
.P This command preserves module ports for the flexible h-tree feature. It can be used on any module port in the clock tree. It will preserve the specified module ports in both, clock tree synthesis and flexible h-tree synthesis. Any sinks connected downstream of the ports will remain downstream, and only those ports will be considered downstream.
.P Note: Currently, physical locations are only supported for flexible h-tree synthesis, and only on partition boundaries, although they will be accepted on all other module ports. Also, ports belonging to hInsts that have siblings but are not defined as partitions are not supported.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help          \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each preserve_ccopt_port parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man preserve_ccopt_port.   "\fB-file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the preserved port list report.   "\fB-list\fR" Prints a list of currently preserved ports.   "\fB-location\fR" Provides the location of the preserved port specified using the <portname> parameter.  "\fB<portname>\fR" Specifies the name of the port.   "\fB-reset\fR" Resets the preservation settings for the preserved port specified using the <portname> parameter.   "\fB-reset_all  \fR" Resets all port preservation settings.   "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Returns a tcl list of currently preserved ports.  Note: The parameters, -list and -tcl_list are mutually exclusive. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following command to mark a port on a partition boundary as preserved and set the location:  preserve_ccopt_port m0/ck -location {100 100}   "*" 2 Use the following command to see the report, which shows both the port that was set and its sibling:  preserve_ccopt_port -list  Port m0/ck fixed at (100.000,100.000)  Sibling port m1/ck fixed at (900.960,100.000)   "*" 2 Use the following command to view the report of preserved ports as a tcl list:  preserve_ccopt_port -tcl_list  The software returns the following information:  {m0/ck 100.0 100.0} {m1/ck 900.96 100.0}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following command to reset the port, in this case by specifying the sibling:  preserve_ccopt_port -reset m1/ck  Now both ports have been cleared  preserve_ccopt_port -list
.RE
.P   The software returns nothing.
