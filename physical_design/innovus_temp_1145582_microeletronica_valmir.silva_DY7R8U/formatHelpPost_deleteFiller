.SH Name \fBdeleteFiller\fR \-  Removes physical cell instances, such as filler cells, end-cap cells, and well-tap cells, from standard cell rows
.SH Syntax \fBdeleteFiller\fR  [-cell <fillerCellList>]  [-area {llx lly urx ury}]  [-inst <instanceName>]  [-prefix <prefix>]   [-keepFixed] 
.P Removes physical cell instances, such as filler cells, end-cap cells, and well-tap cells, from standard cell rows. This command can be called if there are filler cells, end-cap cells, or well-tap cells added in the design.   Note: Physical cells should not be removed with the <Delete> key. If you delete a cell using the <Delete> key, the cell will become unplaced. The cell will not be displayed in the layout, but it will still be part of the design. You should remove a physical cell using the deleteFiller command.   Note: Some deleteFiller parameters can also be specified with setFillerMode. However, the parameters you specify with deleteFiller apply to the current deleteFiller run only, and supersede parameters set by setFillerMode. For more information, see setFillerMode.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-area {llx lly urx ury}\fR" Specifies the bounding box within which the filler cells are deleted. The argument type is a box, in microns.  Note: Only those filler cells that are completely contained within the area will be deleted. the command does not delete filler cells that cross the area boundary.  "\fB-cell <fillerCellList>\fR" Specifies a cell name or list of cells to delete. Separate cell names with spaces.  Note: Cells specified by this parameter override the list of cells provided by the -core parameter of setFillerMode.  "\fB-keepFixed\fR" Controls the command to keep the End-cap and Well-tap cells that are marked FIXED. By default, those cells will be deleted if this option is not specified.  Deletes End-cap and Well-tap cells by default, though they are marked as FIXED.  Default: true  "\fB-prefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies the prefix of the cell instances to delete.  For example, to delete all filler cell instances with the prefix FILL, type the following command:  deleteFiller -prefix FILL   The software will remove all physical instances whose name starts with FILL, including instances named FILL_1, FILLTEMP_1, and so on.  Default: FILLER  "\fB-inst <instanceName>\fR" Specifies the instance of the cell to delete. You can use wildcards (*?) with this parameter.  Note: You can specify this parameter with this command or with addFiller, and not with setFillerMode. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes all physical-only cells from the design:   deleteFiller -cell xyz
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes only the xyz cells whose instance names have a wtap_even prefix. If well-tap cells in even rows have a wtap_even prefix and well-tap cells in odd rows have a different prefix, the cells in rows 2, 4, 6, and so on are deleted.   deleteFiller -cell xyz -prefix wtap_even
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes all added cell instances with the prefix instance name FILLER:   deleteFiller -prefix FILLER
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes all instances of filler cell FILL2, end-cap ecp17, and well-tap wtp5:   deleteFiller -cell FILL2 ecp17 wtp5
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes all instances of given the spacer cells from the design:   deleteFiller -cell FILL64 FILL32 Fill8 FILL16 FILL2 FILL1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes all well-tap and end-cap cell instances from the design:   deleteFiller -cell WELLTAP PRECAP POSTCAP
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command deletes all physical cells with prefix WELLTAP in the specified bounding box of {0 0 300 300} except those cells with FIXED status:   deleteFiller -prefix WELLTAP -area {0 0 300 300} -keepFixed
.RE
