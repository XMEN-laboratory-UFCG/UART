.TH reportWire  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreportWire\fR \-  Creates a report file that contains wire statistics for signal nets with a real wire length or minimum wire length that is greater than the specified threshold ratio
.SH Syntax \fBreportWire\fR  [-help]  [<fileName>]  [<threshold>]  [-detail]   [-maxFanout<integer>]  [-minWireLength <float>]  [-sort {ratio wire_length half_perimeter}]  [-summary] 
.P Creates a report file that contains wire statistics for signal nets with a real wire length or minimum wire length that is greater than the specified threshold ratio. The wire statistics for signal nets can also be based on the fanout or wire length of the net.
.P Ratio (r) is calculated as r = (total net routing length) / (half-perimeter of net bounding box).
.P The wire information reported includes the net name, the wire ratio, the real and minimum wire lengths, the number of vias, and the number of fanins and fanouts on the net. Use the reportWire command after routing with any of the routing commands in the Innovus software.
.P Note: Use the reportRoutecommand to generate a layer-by-layer wire statistics report. Use the reportSpecialRoute command to generate a report for special nets. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-detail\fR" Includes detailed information in the report. This includes the wire length and number of vias for each layer, and a summary of the total wire length and via number for the design.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Creates a report file using the specified name.  Default: Creates a report file named <topcell>.wirerpt  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each reportWire parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command  man reportWire.  "\fB-maxFanout <fanout>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of net's fanout.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-minWireLength <length>\fR" Specifies the minimum wire length of the net.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-sort {ratio wire_length half_perimeter}\fR" Specifies the order in which the nets are sorted in the output report. The nets can be sorted as per the ratio, wire length, or half perimeter length.  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-summary\fR" Specifies that just the summary table should be displayed in the report.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB<threshold>\fR" Reports wire statistics for wires with lengths greater than the specified threshold ratio. If you do not specify a threshold ratio, the reportWire command calculates wire information for wires with a ratio greater than 1.0.  Default: 1.0  Note: There are many situations in which the threshold ratio can be less than 1.0. To ensure that the software creates a report on all nets, specify a ratio value of 0.  Data_type: float, optional
