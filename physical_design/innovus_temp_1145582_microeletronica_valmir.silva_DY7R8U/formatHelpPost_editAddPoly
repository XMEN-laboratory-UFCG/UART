.TH editAddPoly  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBeditAddPoly\fR \-  Defines a vertex or corner of a polygon
.SH Syntax \fBeditAddPoly\fR  [-help]   <point> 
.P Defines a vertex or corner of a polygon. By issuing the editAddPoly command n times, you can create a polygon with n+1 sides. You can then specify the editCommitPoly command to end the polygon at the specified coordinates. editAddPoly honors the setEditMode -shape option. This means if you want to create a polygon of a specific shape, you can first use setEditMode -shape to specify the required shape and then use editAddPoly and editCommitPoly to create the polygon.
.P The editAddPoly command is DRC aware. When you create a polygon shape using this command, the tool marks any DRC violations in the shape during creation, provided that setEditMode -dcr_on is set to 1 (default). 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editAddPoly parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man editAddPoly  "\fB<point>\fR" Specifies the x and y coordinates of a vertice or corner of a wire polygon. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands create three-sided wire polygon that ends at the point specified by editCommitPoly.   editAddPoly 700 300  editAddPoly 700 500  editCommitPoly 200 400  The first side of the wire polygon starts at 700, 300 and ends at 700, 500. The second side starts at 700, 500 and ends at 200, 400. The third side is formed by joining the starting point of the polygon (700,300) and the ending point specified by editCommitPoly (200,400).
