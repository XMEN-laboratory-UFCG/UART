.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each write_category_summary parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man write_category_summary  "\fB-ascend\fR" Specifies that the report in ascending order, should specify option -byTNS or -byWNS.  "\fB-byTNS\fR" The TNS value specified by the sorting key through the option -ascend or -descend.  "\fB-byWNS\fR" The WNS value specified by the sorting key through the option -ascend or -descend.  "\fB-csv\fR" Reports entries in csv format.   "\fB-descend\fR" Specifies that the report in descending order, should specify option -byTNS or -byWNS.  "\fB-no_frame_fix_width\fR" Specifies that the table columns have a fixed minimum width, but no maximum width (the data does not wrap). Column data that fits within the column's minimum width will left-justify and pad its location to fill the specified column space.  Column data that is longer than the column's minimum width will take as much space in the table as needed. If a column is overwritten by the data from the preceding column, its data will begin on a new line at the correct column location.  "\fB-no_split\fR" Specifies that each column follows the preceding column without splitting to a new line, if the data in one column overruns the next column. The wrapping behavior for data is controlled by the size of the display window.  This format is useful for machine parsing the report.  Note: You must specify -no_frame_fix_width in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-report fileName\fR" Specifies the name of the category report file.  Default: category.rpt
