.P Specifies the switching activity for all primary inputs, nets, and other devices in the design whose activity has not been previously defined through user attributes, the toggle count format (TCF) file, the value change dump (VCD) file, or the tracing of the clock network.
.P You can use this command to specify user-defined activities at the design level. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-black_box_density <value>\fR" Specifies to set the default transition density on all the output pins of all blackboxes in the design.  The -black_box_density and -black_box_duty parameters must be used together. If one or both of these parameters are not specified, then the software will use the average transition density from all the input pins of the blackboxes.  "\fB-black_box_duty <value>\fR" Specifies to set the default duty on all the output pins of all blackboxes in the design.  The -black_box_density and -black_box_duty parameters must be used together. If one or both of these parameters are not specified, then the software will use the average transition density from all the input pins of the blackboxes.  "\fB-clip_activity_to_domain_freq {true | false}\fR" Specifies to perform domain-based activity clipping. This parameter clips data paths to 1x frequency whereas the clock networks are still at 2x frequency. This parameter allows you to have more control to determine the rate of clipping with respect to frequency.   "\fB-clock_gates_enable {<activity_factor>}\fR" Specifies the activity at the enable pin(s) of the clock gating cells.  "\fB-clock_gates_output {<activity_factor>}\fR" Specifies the activity at the output pin(s) of the clock gating cells. This works for both ICGs as well as combinational clock gating cells.  Example:  set_default_switching_activity -global_activity 0.02 -clock_gates_output 2.0 (clock is transparent)  transition_density of clock gate output is calculated by:  (1/clock_domain_frequency) * clockgateOutputsActivity = 1/(0.431*e-9) * activity_factor  In this case, transition_density = clock_domain_frequency * clockgateOutputsActivity = 1e9/0.431 * 2 = 4,640,371,200  "\fB-clock_gates_output_ratio <num>\fR" Specifies to control transition density at the output pin(s) of the integrated and combinational clock gating cells. This parameter is equivalent to specifying the parameters -icg_ratio and -comb_clockgate_ratio together with the same value.  For example, the set_default_switching_activity -clock_gates_output_ratio 0.6 is equivalent to set_default_switching_activity -icg_ratio 0.6 -comb_clockgate_ratio 0.6.  Note: This parameter has a cascading effect when there are multiple levels of ICG cells on the clock path. For example, when -clock_gates_output_ratio is set to 0.5, the first level ICG cell will have 0.5 ratio of the root clock's toggle density, the second level ICG cell will have 0.5*0.5=0.25 ratio of the root clock's toggle density, and the third level ICG cell will have 0.5*0.5*0.5=0.125 ratio of the root clock's toggle density, and so on.  Note: For dynamic power analysis, fastest clock on the path is used for calculating output toggle density. However, for static power analysis, weighted averaging of input toggle densities is used.  Example for static power analysis:  set_default_switching_activity -global_activity 0.02 -clock_gates_output_ratio 1.0  Transition density for either a combinational or an integrated clock gating cell with 'N' inputs is calculated by:  output_pin_transition_density = (summation) weighted_input_transition_density = clock_gates_output_ratio * [(duty_input_pin1 * Td_input_pin1) + (duty_input_pin2 * Td_input_pin2) +
... + (duty_input_pinN * Td_input_pinN)]  Given a 2:1 clock Mux and assuming duty of 0.5 for all input pins:  Td is the toggle density for each input pin of the instance (Td_pinSe1 , Td_pinI0 , Td_pinI1).  output_pin_transition_density = 1.0 * [0.5 * Td_pinSe1 + 0.5 * Td_pinI0 + 0.5 * Td_pinI1]  "\fB-comb_clockgate_ratio <num>\fR" Specifies to set the propagation ratio for combinational clock gate cell outputs. When specified, this parameter sets the output activity of any instance that is identified as a combinational clock gating cell to <num> times the fastest transition density arriving on the instance's clock inputs. This parameter cannot be specified with the -hier parameter.  Notes: 
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter does not apply to combinational clockgates with a constant data input, that is, a select pin tied low.  "*" 2 For dynamic power analysis, fastest clock on the path is used for calculating output toggle density. However, for static power analysis, weighted averaging of input toggle densities is used. For a detailed static power analysis example, refer to '-clock_gates_output_ratio', limiting calculations only to combinational clock gates.
.RE   "\fB-duty <value>\fR" Specifies the duty cycle, which is the probability that the signal is a logical 1.  Note: You must specify the -period parameter when assigning a duty.  Default: 0.5 (equivalent to a 50 percent duty cycle)  "\fB-global_activity <factor>\fR" Specifies the average number of times that all unset nodes switch in a clock cycle. If not specified the fastest domain frequency will be used unless one turns off clock domains.  Note: Due to activity precedence, the -global_activity and -seq_activity parameters of the set_default_switching_activity command are mutually exclusive. If both the parameters are specified, -global_activity takes precedence.  "\fB-hier <hierarchy_name>\fR" A hierarchical name that the global activity is being assigned to. If not provided, the whole design is assumed.  "\fB-icg_ratio <num>\fR" Specifies to set the propagation ratio for integrated clock gate (ICG) cell outputs. When specified, this parameter sets the output pin of all identified ICG instances to <num> times the fastest transition density arriving on clock inputs of the instance.  This parameter cannot be specified with the -hier parameter.  "\fB-input_activity <factor>\fR" Specifies the average number of times that a primary input switches in a clock cycle. It can be any positive number.  Default: 0.2 (Switches once every five clock cycles.)  "\fB-macro_activity <factor>\fR" Specifies the activity factor for macros in a design. The allowed values for this parameter are between 0 to 1.  If you set the macro activity to
.30, 30% of macros in the design would be selected for switching in a given cycle during dynamic simulation. When -macro_activity is specified for the static power analysis, all output pins of the macros are assigned the specified activity.  Default: 0.2  "\fB-name <activity_name>\fR" Allows you to set the activity level for the specified jitter activity name. You can define a low/high activity level for jitter analysis.  Examples:  set_default_switching_activity      -name low -clock_gates_output 0 -global_activity 0.01  set_default_switching_activity      -name high -clock_gates_output 2 -global_activity 0.2  "\fB-period <value>\fR" Specifies the default operating period (1/frequency). It is the period that the activity is referenced to. If not specified, the software uses the dominant clock in the design. The specified period will only be applied to nets that do not have reference clock (ref_clock) associated with the net.  If no clock is specified, the software generates an error and prompts you to enter one. Units in seconds (s), milliseconds (ms), microseconds (us), nanoseconds (ns), or picoseconds (ps).  Note: If you enter the period as a negative number, the software reverts back to using the default frequency.  Default: The time unit is defined in the first
.lib file read during design import.  "\fB-seq_activity <factor>\fR" Specifies the activity of outputs of the sequential logic. This value will be used at the output ports of flops for propagating activity.  If the sequential activity is not specified, propagation will be done for the full design starting from the input ports.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all specified options back to default values.  "\fB-reset_type { global_activity | seq_activity
... }\fR" Specifies to selectively reset the global specifications.  Note: You must use the -reset_type parameter in conjunction with the -reset parameter.
