.SH Name \fBbit_blasted_port_style\fR
.SH Syntax \fBbit_blasted_port_style\fR %s_%d
.P Type: String
.P Default: %s_%d, persistent
.P This global variable is used to define the bus bit blasted port name.
.P Specifies the naming style to be used if mapped ports are bit blasted with the command bitblast_ports. The values of this global need to contain elements %s and %d.
.P The following rules apply:
.RS  "*" 2 A port name always starts with the base name (represented by %s)  "*" 2 The suffix is appended to the base name to form port name, according to the format specified in the global value.  "*" 2 %d represents the bit information.

.SH Example
.P The default of %s_%d will convert a bus-bit A[0] to A_0.
.P If you want to keep the original bus-bit name but have it turned into an escaped scalar name you can use:
.P set_db bit_blasted_port_style {%s\\[%d\\]}
.P This will convert a bus-bit A[0] to an escaped scalar name A\\[0\\] in Tcl, so the port
.name would be A[0], the
.escaped_name would be A\\[0\\], the dual-ported-object name would look like {port:top/A\\[0\\]} with Tcl adding the {} around it to protect the \\ chars, and the Verilog port would look like \\A[0]
.
.P One advantage of this is that SDC commands and Innovus Tcl commands that use port names with A[0] will still soft-match the new A\\[0\\] name, so they do not have to change. However, using escaped names may require careful Tcl scripting to make sure you do not inadvertently lose the escaped \\ chars when you want them.
