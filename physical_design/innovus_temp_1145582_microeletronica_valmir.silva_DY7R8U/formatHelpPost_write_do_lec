.P Writes out the dofile for the Conformal Logical Equivalence Checker tool.
.P For formal verification of the Innovus-generated netlists, the write_do_lec command generates, within Innovus, the Conformal LEC scripts (such as dofile). These scripts are used for equivalence checking. You can generate a flat or a hierarchical comparison script. The dofile written out by this command contains standard Conformal flow commands and you will need to add the DFT constraints if netlist is scan inserted.
.P The write_do_lec command creates a verification directory, if does not already exist, in which the name mapping information file will be created. The name mapping file will usually contain the mapping information of MBIT flops against its split/single bit candidate. By default, the name of this verification directory is fv/invs/%s. You can use write_lec_directory_naming_style to change the directory name. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each write_do_lec parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man write_do_lec  "\fB<output_filename>\fR" Specifies the name for the output file to be written.   "\fB-checkpoint <lec_checkpoint_file>\fR" Specifies the name of the LEC checkpoint file to save at the end.   "\fB-flat  \fR" Creates a flat comparison script.   "\fB-golden_design <filename>\fR" Specifies the user-written netlist file name to use as the golden design.    "\fB-hier \fR" Creates a hierarchical comparison script.   "\fB-log_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the LEC log file.   "\fB-no_exit\fR" Skips the exit command at end of dofile.   "\fB-pre_compare <filename>\fR" Specifies an extra dofile to be sourced right before 'compare'.    "\fB-pre_exit <filename>\fR" Specifies an extra dofile to be sourced right before 'exit'.    "\fB-pre_read <filename>\fR" Specifies an extra dofile to be sourced right before reading library/design.    "\fB-revised_design <filename>\fR" Specifies the user-written netlist file name to use as the revised design.    "\fB-verbose\fR" Specifies whether the generated dofile will report verbosely.   "\fB-write_session <lec_session_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the LEC session to save at the end.   "\fB> <output_filename>\fR" Specifies the name for the output file to be written.
