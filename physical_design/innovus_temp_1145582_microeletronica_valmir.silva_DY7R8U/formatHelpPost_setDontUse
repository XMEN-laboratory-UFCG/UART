.SH Name \fBsetDontUse\fR \-  Sets a dont_use attribute on a cell, prohibiting timing optimization commands from using this cell during optimization
.SH Syntax \fBsetDontUse\fR  [-help]{{<cellName> <value>} | {-reset}}  [-hinst <hinstName>[-reset]]  
.P Sets a dont_use attribute on a cell, prohibiting timing optimization commands from using this cell during optimization. Optionally, you can specify a library that contains the cell. Using this command overrides the library and/or timing constraints. The dont_use attribute you set remains persistent through save and restore operations.
.P If you set the dont_use attribute on a cell whose dont_use attribute is already set, the software issues a warning message, for example:
.P setDontUse buff1 true  Setting BUFF1 as a don't use cell  setDontUse buff1 true  Warning: Cell BUFF1 already has a dont_use attribute 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setDontUse parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setDontUse.  "\fB<cellName>\fR" Specifies the cell to constrain. To choose a cell in a specific library, specify <libName/cellName>. You can use wildcards to specify cell names.  "\fB-hinst <hinstName>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical module instance names on which the don't use setting should be applied. This parameter is specified with the <cellName> and the <value> parameters.  setDontUse -hinst <cellName value>  The following scenarios are applicable to the use of this parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 The hinst setting overrides the non-instance specific settings. For example:  setDontUse -hinst Inst1 BUFX1 false  Where Inst1 is the instance name, BUFX1 is the cell name, and the value is set to false  setDontUse BUFX1 true  Where BUFX1 is the cell name and the value is set to true  In the above example, the first command will override the second command and so the cell, BUFX1 is usable within the instance, Inst1, but not elsewhere within the design.  "*" 2 The more specific definition always takes precedence irrespective of the sequence of commands. For example:  Setting 1  setDontUse -hinst Inst1/Inst2 BUFX1 true  setDontUse -hinst Inst1 BUFX1 false  In Inst1/Inst2, the dont_use attribute of BUFX1 is true  Setting 2  setDontUse -hinst Inst1 BUFX1 false   setDontUse -hinst Inst1/Inst2 BUFX1 true  In Inst1/Inst2, the dont_use attribute of BUFX1 is also true  So, the above two settings are equivalent.  "*" 2 When using this parameter, complete instance names should be specified. Wildcards are not supported.  "*" 2 The true or false value specified for cells using the setDontUse command can be reset by using the -reset parameter alongwith the -hinst parameter.
.RE   "\fB-reset\fR" This parameter is used with the -hinst parameter. When specified, it removes all dont_use constraints attached to the specified hierarchical module instance.  setDontUse -hinst A BUF1 true  setDontUse -hinst A -reset  The above command resets the dont_use attribute on cell BUF1 in hinst A.  Note: The setDontUse -hinst <hinstName> -reset command clears the "don't use" settings for the specified hierarchical instances but does not clear the "don't use" settings for any sub-hierarchical instances inside the specified hierarchical instances. For example:  setDontUse -hinst A BUF1 true  setDontUse -hinst A/B BUF2 true  setDontUse -hinst A -reset  The above sequence of commands resets the dont_use constraint on BUF1 but does not reset the dont_use constaint on BUF2.  Note: The standard design-wide dont_use constraints from SDC,
.lib, and the setDontUse command without the -hinst parameter will still apply.  "\fB<value>\fR" Specifies whether to set or unset the dont_use attribute: true sets the dont_use attribute on the specified cell, and false unsets it. 
.SH Command Order
.P Use this command before you run optDesign. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands set buff1 and buff2 as "don't use" cells:  setDontUse buff1 true  Setting BUFF1 as a don't use cell  setDontUse buff2 true  Setting BUFF2 as a don't use cell  "*" 2 The following command sets AND2 in library libSlow as "don't use" cells:  setDontUse libSlow/AND2 true  Setting libSlow/AND2 as a don't use cell
