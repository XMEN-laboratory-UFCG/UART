.SH Name \fBmerge_model_timing\fR \-  Merges extracted timing models (ETM) for various analysis views into a single output
.SH Syntax \fBmerge_model_timing\fR  [-help]  [-keep_separate_arc]  -library_file <string>  -mode_group <string>  -modes <string>  [-outfile <string>]  [-pin_cap_tolerance <float>]  [-tolerance <float>] 
.P Merges extracted timing models (ETM) for various analysis views into a single output.
.P The merge_model_timing command should be the last command in the run script. Also, this command should be run separately in a Tempus session when a design is not loaded. 
.P When the DRV values are different in the libraries that are merged, then Tempus saves the worst value of the DRV with a warning message. 
.P If the DRV values are not equal, the greater value is stored for the following:
.RS  "*" 2 Minimum transition  "*" 2 Minimum capacitance  "*" 2 Minimum fanout
.RE
.P The smaller value is stored for the following, in case of unequal DRVs:
.RS  "*" 2 Maximum transition  "*" 2 Maximum capacitance  "*" 2 Maximum fanout  "*" 2 Fanout load
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-keep_separate_arc\fR" Enables creating separate timing arcs with respective modes.  "\fB-library_file <string>\fR" Specifies input library files that are to be merged.  "\fB<->modes <string>\fR" Specifies the mode names required for merging the libraries. The number of mode names should be equal to the number of input libraries.  "\fB-mode_group string\fR" Specifies the name of the mode group.  "\fB-outfile string\fR" Specifies the name of the merged library output file name. By default, the output file name is merge.lib.  "\fB-pin_cap_tolerance float\fR" Specifies the pin capacitance tolerance for making tolerance comparison for library merging.   "\fB-tolerance <float>\fR" Specifies the tolerance value for making tolerance comparison for library merging. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command merges library files model1.view1.lib and model1.view1.lib.ref into a single output file:   merge_model_timing -library_file "model1.view1.lib model1.view1.lib.ref"  -modes "v1 v2" -mode_group v1_v2
