.SH Name \fBuniquify_partition\fR \-  Removes the master and clone association by uniquifying the cells (module) in the netlist
.SH Syntax \fBuniquify_partition\fR  [-help]   -hinst <hierarchical_instance_name>
.P Removes the master and clone association by uniquifying the cells (module) in the netlist.
.P Note: You can use the undo_uniquify_partition command to remove the uniquification and bring back the master and clone association. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each uniquify_partition parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man uniquify_partition  "\fB-hinst <hierarchical_instance_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the hierarchical instance to uniquify. Based of the specified hierarchical instance, its cell (module) is identified. All other occurrences of the identified cell are renamed by adding the _<number> suffix (for example  cellname_<number>) in order to uniquify the cell.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 You can specify any hierarchical instance with the uniquify_partition command. It does not necessarily have to be a master.   "*" 2 The uniquify_partition command preserves the orientation of the hierarchical instances.  "*" 2 The uniquify_partition command preserves the pin location of the hierarchical instances.  "*" 2 A new cell name is created for each hierarchical instance.
.RE   Data_type: string, required 
.SH Example
.P The following command identifies the cell associated with I1/p3 and then renames all other occurrences of the cell in order to remove the master and clone association.  uniquify_partition -hinst I1/p3
