.TH analyze_paths_by_hier_port  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBanalyze_paths_by_hier_port\fR \-  Helps you to automatically group paths based on each hierarchical port of a given instance
.SH Syntax \fBanalyze_paths_by_hier_port\fR  [-help]  {{-gen_hier_file <string> [-out_file <string>]} | {-load_hier_file <string>}}  [-master <string>]  
.P Helps you to automatically group paths based on each hierarchical port of a given instance. You can use this command to perform the timing results analysis of a hierarchical design. For example, while looking at the setup/hold time at the same time of each port.
.P The command can be applied wherever the user loads the machine readable timing report. To delete the path categories created by this command, use delete_path_category. For more information on creating path categories, see "Creating Path Categories" in the Debugging Timing Results chapter of Innovus User Guide. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each analyze_paths_by_hier_port parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man analyze_paths_by_hier_port  "\fB-gen_hier_file <string>\fR" Generates hier ports fanin/fanout file when the database is available based on the given InstanceName_list. Then uses that file to create the categories.  "\fB-load_hier_file <string>\fR" Uses a previously saved hier ports fanin/fanout file when the database is not available.  "\fB-master <string>\fR" Specifies that the timing paths should be categorized only for the specified master category.   "\fB-out_file <string>\fR" Specifies the generated hier ports fanin/fanout file name. 
.SH Example
.P The following command categorizes paths based on hierarchical port of the instance DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST:
.P analyze_paths_by_hier_port -gen_hier_file DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST
