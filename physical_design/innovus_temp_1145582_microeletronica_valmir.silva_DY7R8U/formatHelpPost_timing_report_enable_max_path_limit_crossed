.SH Name \fBtiming_report_enable_max_path_limit_crossed\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_report_enable_max_path_limit_crossed\fR  {true | false}
.P Default: false
.P Determines if the number of reported paths for a particular clock group equals the specified maximum paths limit.
.P When set to true, the software will issue a warning message in case the number of reported paths for a clock group is equal to the given maximum paths limit. This applies to both graph- and path-based reporting modes.
.P This variable is supported in clock group-based non-statistical reporting flows only. The clock group-based reporting mode can be enabled by setting timing_report_group_based_mode global variable to true.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
