.P Controls the behavior of addEndCap command. Specifies a list of cells that addEndCap command uses for end-cap or triple-well cap insertion.
.P Note: The options with *EVEN/*ODD are only for 10nm designs that need to fit even and odd sites. These options should not be used with the options that do not have *EVEN/*ODD.  For example, the -rightEdge option should not be used with the-rightEdgeEven or -rightEdgeOdd option.
.P Example for 10nm design if there is EVEN/ODD sites requirement:
.P setEndCapMode \\   -rightEdgeOdd <cellName> \\   -rightEdgeEven <cellName> \\   -rightBottomCornerEven <cellName> \\   -rightBottomCornerOdd <cellName> \\   -rightTopCornerEven <cellName> \\   -rightTopCornerOdd <cellName> \\   -rightBottomEdgeEven <cellName> \\   -rightBottomEdgeOdd <cellName> \\   -rightTopEdgeEven <cellName> \\   -rightTopEdgeOdd <cellName> \\   -topEdge {<ListOfCellNames>} \\   -bottomEdge {<ListOfCellNames>}

.RE
.P setEndCapMode -leftEdge ABC -rightEdge XYZ

.RE
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 Pre-caps for start of rows would be cap_RE in R0 (N) and MX (FS) orient.

.RE
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 Caps for bottom of core, and in core-row on top of macro blocks would be cap_TE in R0 (N) orient (i.e. core has to start from R0 row; else the bottom FS row would be wasted).

.RE
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 Caps for top of core, and at bottom of macro blocks would be cap_TE in MX (FS) orient (that is, if block gets placed on a FS row, and row below it is N row, then the N row has to be blocked so caps can be placed below it on FS orient row).
