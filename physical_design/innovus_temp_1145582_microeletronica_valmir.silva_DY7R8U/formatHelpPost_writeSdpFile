.TH writeSdpFile  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBwriteSdpFile\fR \-  Saves the current SDP relative placement information into a file
.SH Syntax \fBwriteSdpFile\fR  [-help]   -file <file_name>  [-template | -topGroup <group_name>]   [-template | -command]  [-template  | [-updateRelativePlaceConstraint | -updateOrientation]]
.P Saves the current SDP relative placement information into a file. By default, the output is in
.sdp format. writeSdpFile enables you to save SDP relative information so it can be reloaded in another Innovus session.
.P The writeSdpFile command can be run any time after SDPs have been defined. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each writeSdpFile parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man writeSdpFile.  "\fB-command\fR" Specifies that the relative placement information should be saved in TCL commands format instead of
.sdp format.  "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file containing SDP relative information.  "\fB-template\fR" Specifies that the file should be saved as a template in
.sdp format.  Note: This parameter cannot be used with -command or -topGroup.  "\fB-topGroup <group_name>\fR" Indicates that the relative placement information of only the specified SDP group should be written.  "\fB-updateOrientation\fR" Updates the orientation of SDP instances before writing them to the SDP file.  "\fB-updateRelativePlaceConstraint\fR" Updates relative placement constraints of SDPs before writing out the SDP file. Use this parameter to write out the updated SDP/TCL file after any change in SDP relative placement due to placeDesign or manual changes. The -updateRelativePlaceConstraint option can be used with the -command and -topGroup options as well.
