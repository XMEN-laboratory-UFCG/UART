.SH Name \fBset_sense\fR \-  Selects which phase of the clock to filter at the specified point
.SH Syntax \fBset_sense\fR   [-help]  <pin_or_port_list>  [-clocks <clock_list>]  {[-positive | -negative | -stop_propagation ] [-type <type_list> ]}
.P Selects which phase of the clock to filter at the specified point. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-clocks <clock_list>\fR" Specifies a list of clocks passing through a specified point to which the constraint applies.  When this parameter is not specified, the filtering of clock phase will be applicable to all the clocks passing through that specified point.  This parameter must be used with a specified pin name and one of the parameters : -positive, -negative, or -stop_propagation.  "\fB-negative\fR" Specifies that positive phase filtered clocks pass through pins in the <pin_list>.  "\fB<pin_or_port_list>\fR" Specifies the list or collection of cell output pins. The unateness specified by the set_sense command is applied to clocks propagating through the specified point.  "\fB-positive\fR" Specifies that negative phase filtered clocks pass through pins in the <pin_list>.  "\fB-stop_propagation\fR" Stops the propagation of specified clocks and clock source data paths passing through the specified pins.  "\fB-type <type_list>\fR" Applies clock sense to object types specified in the <type_list>. The type list options are - all, clock, data, clock_source_data, default_data.  These are explained below:
.RS  "*" 2 all: Stops all phases from propagating. This is equivalent to specifying both the clock and data options.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 clock: Stops clock phases launched by clock(s) specified in the <clock_list>from propagating.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 data: Stops all data phases launched by clock(s) specified in <clock_list>, starting from the pins/ports specified in <pin_or_port_list>. The objects in the pin_or_port_list can be selected anywhere in the design - clock/data network.  "*" 2 clock_source_data: Stops only clock source data phases from propagating. The combination of clock_source_data and clock is equivalent to the existing -stop_propagation option.
.RE   The -type parameter extends the capability of the set_clocks_sense command to selectively block data timing phases. This parameter provides a more generalized use model for selecting among all types of paths that should be filtered.  The -type parameter is mutually exclusive with the -positive, -negative, and -stop_propagation options. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command allows the positive phase clock CLK1 to pass through CLKBUF1/Z and filters out the negative phase clock CLK1:  set_sense -positive -clocks CLK1 CLKBUF1/Z  "*" 2  The following command stops clock phases starting from pin1:  set_sense pin1 -type {clock}  "*" 2  The following command stops data phases based only on CK1 and CK2 starting from pin1:  set_sense pin1 -type {data} -clocks {CK1 CK2}  "*" 2  The following command stops only the clock source data phases starting from pin1:  set_sense pin1 -type {clock_source_data}  "*" 2  The following command stops the clock and clock source data phases:  set_sense pin1 -type {clock clock_source_data}  or  set_sense pin1 -stop_propagation
