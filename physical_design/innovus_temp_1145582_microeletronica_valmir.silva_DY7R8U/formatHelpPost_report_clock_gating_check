.SH Name \fBreport_clock_gating_check\fR \-  Reports information of all or specific clock gating checks of the current design
.SH Syntax \fBreport_clock_gating_check\fR  [<object_list>]  [-view <view_name>]  [{> | >>} <file_name>] 
.P Reports information of all or specific clock gating checks of the current design. If you specify a list of pins, cells, or clocks, the clock gating check information is reported for the specified objects only. If you use the report_clock_gating_check command without an object list, all clock gating check information is reported.
.P The Type column of the generated report (see examples below) can contain one of the following abbreviations:
.RS  "*" 2 I indicates that the clock gating check is inferred.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 L indicates that the clock gating check is from the library (integrated clock gating check).
.RE
.P Set the report_precision global variable using the set_global command to specify the accuracy of the result in terms of number of significant digits. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies a list of pins, instances, or clocks. A collection of these can also be specified.
.RS  "*" 2 Pin: Any pin of a clock gating cell can be specified and the check information will be reported for that pin.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Instance: Any instance name of a clock gating cell can be specified and the check information will be reported for that instance.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Clock: Only a clock at a given clock (reference) pin of a cell can be specified for reporting the check information. Check information about the clocks at enable (signal) pin cannot be reported.
.RE   If the <object_list> parameter is not specified, all the clock gating check points (inferred and library) of the current design are reported.  "\fB-view <view_name>\fR" Specifies a view for which clock gating check is to be reported. The default is worst of all the views.  "\fB{> | >>} <filename>\fR" When specified with >, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.

.SH Examples
.P The following command returns a clock gating check report for the current design:
