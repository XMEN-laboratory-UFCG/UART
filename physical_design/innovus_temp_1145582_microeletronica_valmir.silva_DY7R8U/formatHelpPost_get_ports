.TH get_ports  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBget_ports\fR \-  Creates a collection of ports whose name matches the supplied pattern list
.SH Syntax \fBget_ports\fR  [-help]   [-filter <expr>]   [-regexp]   [-nocase]   [-quiet]   [<patterns> | -of_objects <object_list>]
.P Creates a collection of ports whose name matches the supplied pattern list. Assign this collection to a variable or pass it as an argument to another command.
.P Note: The get_ports command always creates a collection of top level ports irrespective of the current instance set using the current_instance command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression. For any ports that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the port. If the expression is set to true, the port is included in the result.  You can filter ports using any of the port properties supported through the get_property command.  "\fB-nocase\fR" Specifies that pattern matching is not case sensitive.  Note: You must specify -regexp in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all ports associated with the specified nets. You can specify patterns for the net names, a collection of nets, or a combination of patterns and a collection.  "\fB<patterns>\fR" Specifies patterns for port names. Patterns include the * and ? wildcard characters and collections of ports.The command returns a collection of ports that match the patterns. If no such port is found, an empty collection is returned.  "\fB-quiet \fR" Suppresses all error and warning messages generated when the get_ports command is run.  "\fB-regexp\fR" Treats the specified patterns as regular expression patterns.  Default: Treats the specified pattern as wildcard.
