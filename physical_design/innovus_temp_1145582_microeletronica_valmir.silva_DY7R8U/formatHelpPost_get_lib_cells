.SH Name \fBget_lib_cells\fR \-  Creates a collection of library cells from the loaded libraries whose name matches the supplied pattern list
.SH Syntax \fBget_lib_cells\fR  [-help]  [-filter <expr>]   [-regexp]   [-nocase]  [-quiet]   {<pattern_list> | -of_objects <object_list>}  
.P Creates a collection of library cells from the loaded libraries whose name matches the supplied pattern list. Assign these library cells to a variable or pass them to another command. If no objects match the criteria, an empty collection is returned. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression. For any library cells that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the library cell.  You can filter library cells using any of the library cell properties supported through the get_property command.  "\fB-nocase\fR" Specifies that pattern matching is not case sensitive.  Note: You must specify -regexp in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all library cells associated  with the specified library pins or cells or libs. You can specify a list of  library pins or a list of cells or a list of libs, but you cannot specify a  list that contains mixed of library pins and cells and libs. You can specify  patterns for the library pin or cell or lib names, a collection of library pins  or cells or libs, or a combination of patterns and a collection.  "\fB<pattern_list>\fR" Returns only those libraries in the collection whose name matches one or more of the patterns specified in the <pattern_list> argument. The characters ? and * are wild cards. The ? character matches any one character while the * character matches zero or more characters. If a library matches multiple patterns, it appears multiple times in the collection.  A pattern can have only one hierarchical separator character. The left part of the pattern is the library name pattern and the right part is the cell name pattern. If there is no separator character, the pattern is compared to cell names in all the libraries.  A pattern can have only one hierarchical separator character, dividing the pattern into one or two parts. If the hierarchical separator is /, the alternatives are:
.RS  "*" 2 <cell_name_pattern>  Selects all cells whose name matches the <cell_name_pattern> from all libraries.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 <lib_name_pattern>/<cell_name_pattern>  Selects all cells whose name matches the <cell_name_pattern> from all libraries whose name matches the <lib_name_pattern>.
.RE   "\fB-quiet\fR" Suppresses all error and warning messages generated when the get_lib_cells command is run.  "\fB-regexp\fR" Treats the specified patterns as regular expression patterns.  Default: Treats the specified pattern as wildcard 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command prints all cells for all libraries:   get_lib_cells *
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command prints a collection with all cells in the lca500kv lib library:   get_lib_cells lca500kv/*
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command prints a collection with all cells whose names starts with AN in all libraries starting with lca:   get_lib_cells lca*/AN*
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command disables delay arcs on the EF11L050032A library cell. The set_disable_cell_timing command effects all instantiations of the specified cell, and lets you disable delay arcs from and to internal pins.   set_disable_timing -from WACLK -to RBO1 [get_lib_cells {EF11L050032A}]
