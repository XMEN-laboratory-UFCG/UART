.SH Name \fBreport_ccopt_clock_tree_structure\fR \-  Reports the structure of the clock network as a text report
.SH Syntax \fBreport_ccopt_clock_tree_structure\fR  [-help]  [-check_type {setup | hold}]  [-clock_trees {<list_of_clock_trees>}]  [-delay_corner <corner_name>]  [-delay_type {early | late}]  [-expand_below_logic]   [-expand_generated_clock_trees {independently | inline | independently_and_inline}]  [-include_reporting_only_skew_groups]  [-file <file>_<name>]  [-show_sinks]   [-update_timing] 
.P Reports the structure of the clock network as a text report. When the command is run without specfying the -update_timing parameter, the report format is as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 The summary information is added below the name of the clock tree  "*" 2 The slew, capacitance, and co-ordinate information is not included  "*" 2 The input and output pin information is merged in a single line
.RE
.P For details, see the examples below. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help       \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_ccopt_clock_tree_structure parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man report_ccopt_clock_tree_structure.   "\fB-check_type {setup | hold}\fR" Specifies whether setup or hold views are used for the report. By default, setup view is used for the report.   "\fB-clock_trees {<list_of_clock_trees>}     \fR" Restricts the report to the specified clock trees.   "\fB-delay_corner <corner_name>\fR" Reports in the specified delay corner.  By default, the software will use the primary-half delay corner that is set using the CCOpt property, primary_delay_corner. Use the get_ccopt_delay_corner command to retrieve the name of the CCOpt primary-half delay corner.  "\fB-delay_type {early | late}\fR" Reports in the specified delay type, early or late.  When late is specified, only the late half of the delay corners are reported.  When early is specified, only the early half of the delay corners are reported.  By default, late half of the delay corners are reported.  "\fB-expand_below_logic\fR" When this parameter is specified, the subtree below each multi-input logic will be printed in its entirety every time it is encountered.  When this parameter is not specified, then by default, the clock tree below a multi-input clock logic is reported only once, which is at the first place it is encountered in the report. Subsequent visitations of the subtree will simply note the presence of an omitted subtree, for example, "...71 fanout omitted".  Note: For clock networks with ladders of reconverging clock logic, this can produce large volumes of output.  "\fB-expand_generated_clock_trees {independently | inline | independently_and_inline}\fR" Specifies how generated clock trees should be displayed. The following options are available:  independently: display generated clock trees at the top level. This is the default display.  inline : display generated clock trees as fanout of their generator inputs  independently_and_inline: display generated clock trees both at the top level and as fanout of their generator inputs  "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Saves a copy of the report in the specified file.  Default: {}  "\fB-include_reporting_only_skew_groups\fR" When specified, the report additionally includes the reporting-only skew groups. A reporting-only skew group is a skew group whose constrains property is set to none. Such a skew group imposes no clock balancing constraint and will not be considered by CTS.  By default, the reporting-only skew groups are not included in the report.  "\fB-show_sinks\fR" Includes all clock network sinks in the report.  This parameter controls whether the clock network sinks, which are the non-generator flops/latches, are included in the report or not. By default, these are not included in the interest of minimizing the report output. Instead, a count of the number of sinks is displayed,for example. "... 209 sinks omitted".  When this parameter is specified, per-skew group latencies for each sink are included.  Note: The report identifies macros in the clock tree. This means that if your clock sink is a macro, the report will show macro sink instead of just sink.  "\fB-update_timing\fR" When specified, the report includes detailed timing information including pin slew, capacitance, and location along with the clock tree structure.
