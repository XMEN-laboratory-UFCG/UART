.TH timing_prefix_module_name_with_library_genclk  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_prefix_module_name_with_library_genclk\fR \-  When set to true, the software appends the instance name to the clock pin name when creating a generated clock
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_prefix_module_name_with_library_genclk\fR  {true | false}   Default: true 
.P When set to true, the software appends the instance name to the clock pin name when creating a generated clock. When set to false, the software uses only the clock pin name when creating a generated clock.
.P For example, assume the cell for instance a/b in the timing library contained the following generated clock group:  generated_clock(genclk2) {          clock_pin : clk1;          master_pin : "int/clk";          multiplied_by : 2;          duty_cycle : 50.0;  }
.P By default (true), the software creates a generated clock with the following name:  a/b/int/clk
.P If you set the global to false, the software creates a generated clock with the following name:  int/clk
.P If you set this global to false, and the timing_library_genclk_use_group_name global variable is set to true, the software creates a generated clock with the following name:  genclk2
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
