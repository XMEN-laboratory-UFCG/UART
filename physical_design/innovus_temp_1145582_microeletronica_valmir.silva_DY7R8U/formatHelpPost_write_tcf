.SH Name \fBwrite_tcf\fR \-  Writes out the propagated switching activity information to a toggle count format (TCF) file
.SH Syntax  \fBwrite_tcf\fR <file>  [-block <block_name>]  [-exclude_hier_insts <list_of_instances>]  [-primary_input]  [-seq_output]   [-pin]  [-macro_output] 
.P Writes out the propagated switching activity information to a toggle count format (TCF) file. The TCF file contains switching activity information, toggle count information, and the probability of the net or pin being in the logic1 state. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-block <block_name>\fR" Specifies to generate the block-level TCF from the top-level design. When specified, it writes out the block-level duty and activity in the generated TCF file.  The use model of this parameter is:  write_tcf -pin -block <blockname> <TCF_filename>  "\fB-exclude_hier_insts <list_of_instances>\fR" Excludes the specified hierarchical modules or instances when writing out a pin-based TCF. This parameter allows you to ignore the activity generated for the excluded instances.  The use model of this parameter is:  write_tcf -pin -exclude_hier_insts {<list_of_instances>}  "\fB-macro_output\fR" Specifies to generate a TCF file that includes all the activities for the macro outputs in the design.   "\fB-pin\fR" Specifies to write out pin-based TCF.  "\fB-primary_input\fR" Generates a TCF file that includes only the primary inputs in the design.  "\fB-seq_output \fR" Generates a TCF file that includes all the activities for the sequential outputs in the design.  "\fB<file>\fR" Specifies the name of the output TCF file. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command writes the propagated switching activity information to TCF file mmm.tcf:   write_tcf mmm.tcf
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command writes a pin-based TCF for the whole design:   write_tcf -pin pin_design.tcf 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command writes out a TCF which only includes activity information for the primary inputs and sequential outputs in the design:   write_tcf -primary_input -seq_output Power.tcf  "*" 2 The following command writes out a pin-based TCF that excludes the specified hierarchical instances:  write_tcf -pin -exclude_hier_insts {DTMF_INST/CORE_INST DTMF_INST/RAM_128x16 DTMF_INST/RESULTS_INST }
