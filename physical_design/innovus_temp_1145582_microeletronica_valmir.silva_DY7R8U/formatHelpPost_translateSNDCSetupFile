.SH Name \fBtranslateSNDCSetupFile\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtranslateSNDCSetupFile\fR  [-help]  <sndcSetupFile>  <outputFile>  Uses a signalStorm delay calculator setup file as input and converts the transition time and capacitative loading portions to timing constraints commands, such as set_annotated_transitionset_annotated_transition and set_loadset_load. The timing constraints commands are included in the specified output file. This command is useful only if you are using standalone signalStorm delay calculation. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each translateSNDCSetupFile parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man translateSNDCSetupFile.  "\fB<outputFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file, which contain the timing constraints commands.  "\fB<sndcSetupFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the signalStorm delay calculator setup file that will be converted. 
.SH Example
.P The following command uses a signalStorm delay calculator setup file named sndc.setup and generates the constraints.rpt file, which contains the timing constraints commands:
.P         translateSNDCSetupFile sndc.setup constraints.rpt
