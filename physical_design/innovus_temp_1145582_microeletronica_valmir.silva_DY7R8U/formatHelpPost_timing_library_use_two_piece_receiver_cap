.SH Name \fBtiming_library_use_two_piece_receiver_cap\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_library_use_two_piece_receiver_cap\fR {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Enables the use of 2-piece receiver capacitance constructs, if a library contains both the N-piece and 2-piece receiver capacitance construct. 
.P When set to true, if a library has 2-piece and multi-piece pin capacitance, then the software gives priority to 2-piece models.
.P When set to false, the software reads the N-piece receiver capacitance constructs. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
