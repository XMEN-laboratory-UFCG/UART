.SH Name \fBecoOaDesign\fR \-  Imports an OpenAccess database and an ECO-modified netlist
.SH Syntax \fBecoOaDesign\fR  [-help]  <lib cell view>  -ecoVerilogFile <input_fileName>   [-postMask [-<suffix> <suffixName>]]  [-useGACells <GACoreSite>]  [-reportFile <output_fileName>] 
.P Imports an OpenAccess database and an ECO-modified netlist. Restores the physical objects in the database, examines the changes in the new netlist, and implements the required connectivity changes in the logical database without making changes to the physical objects. It preserves the spare cell markings in the old lib/cell/view. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ecoOaDesign parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man ecoOaDesign.  "\fB<cell>\fR" Specifies the OpenAccess cell name of the top cell to import.   "\fB<lib>\fR" Specifies the OpenAccess library name.   "\fB-ecoVerilogFile <input_fileName>\fR" Specifies the changed Verilog netlist.  Note: The original netlist must be written out from the original <lib cell view> and it must be hand-modified to incorporate the required ECO changes.  "\fB-reportFile <output_fileName>\fR" Specifies a report file that shows the additions and removals of instances and nets in the new Verilog netlist.  Default: eco.log  "\fB-postMask\fR" Specifies that ecoOaDesign works in the post-mask mode. If this parameter is not specified, then Innovus considers the mode as pre-mask by default.  "\fB-<suffix> <suffixName>\fR" Specifies the suffix name for the the spare cells.  By default, the suffix is _SPARE.  "\fB<->useGACells<GACoreSite>\fR" Specifies the GA core site.  The -useGACells parameter is valid only in the post-mask mode.
.RS  "*" 2 For cells that match the specified GA core site:
.RS  "*" 2 Newly added GA cells that exist in memory but not in the OpenAccess database are left unplaced.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 GA cells that exist in the OpenAccess database but not in the memory are deleted in the new database.
.RE  "*" 2 For cells that do not match the specified GA core site, Innovus treats them as standard cells as described in post-mask mode.
.RE   "\fB<view>\fR" Specifies the OpenAccess view name to import. 
.SH Examples
.P The following command reads the modified Verilog from the eco.v file, complete physical pre-ECO database from the lib/cell/view designLib/TOP/final in the post-mask mode:
.P ecoOaDesign designLib TOP final -ecoVerilogFile eco.v -postMask
.P In post-mask mode, no physical database changes are allowed and the new logical changes coming through eco.v are incorporated using spare cells in successive ecoPlace and ecoRoute commands.
