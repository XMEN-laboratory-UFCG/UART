.SH Name \fBtiming_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism\fR \-  Enables Clock Path Pessimism Removal (CPPR) analysis during timing analysis
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism\fR  {true | false}  Default: false 
.P Enables Clock Path Pessimism Removal (CPPR) analysis during timing analysis. When set to true, the timing analysis commands remove pessimism from slack calculation. Clock path pessimism is the difference of launching and capturing clock arrival times at the common node. This pessimism can be due to difference in minimum and maximum cell delays along the clock paths or due to the reconvergent clock paths. If the launching and capturing registers are triggered by the same clock and there is no common node between the launching and capturing clock paths, the pessimism is the difference between late and early clock source latencies.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command. 
.P Note: The timing_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism global should not be used with the setAnalysisMode command. Use this global only when the setAnalysisMode command is not available. When the setAnalysisMode command is available, use the -cppr parameter to set or reset the CPPR analysis.
