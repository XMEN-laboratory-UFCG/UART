.SH Name \fBsetBufFootPrint\fR \-  Sets the buffer cell footprint name
.SH Syntax \fBsetBufFootPrint\fR   [-help]  names  [-library <libName>] 
.P Sets the buffer cell footprint name. This footprint name is usually assigned during design import. The software uses buffer footprint names during timing optimization and top-level buffer insertion in a partitioned design. You can specify the library that contains the footprint.
.P Use this command before running timing optimization. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each setBufFootPrint parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setBufFootPrint  "\fB<names>\fR" Specifies the buffer cell footprint name or a buffer cell name. When you specify a buffer cell name the Innovus software automatically finds the cell footprint name.  "\fB-library <libName>\fR" Specifies the library that contains the buffer footprint. You must insert a colon (:) between the library name and the buffer name when you use this parameter. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the buffer cell footprint name to B_1P:   setBufFootPrint B_1P
