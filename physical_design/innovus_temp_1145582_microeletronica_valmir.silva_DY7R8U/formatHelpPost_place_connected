.SH Name \fBplace_connected\fR \-  Places the specified standard cells close to the specified attractor with legal location
.SH Syntax \fBplace_connected\fR  [-help]   -attractor <macro/IO list>   [-fixed]  [-move_fixed]   [-placed]   {-level <integer>  | -sequential all_connected | direct_connected | -stop_points <instance_name> | -before_points <instance_name> | -instance_pin <instance/pin>}   [{ -stop_points <instance_name> | -key_cell <cell_name> }]   [{ -instance_pin <instance/pin> | -key_cell <cell_name> }]   [{ -attractor_pin <pin_list> } [-instance_pin <instance/pin> ]] 
.P Places the specified standard cells close to the specified attractor with legal location. The attractor can be IOs, hard macros, fixed standard cell. The recommended flow is to run this command before place_design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each place_connected parameter.   "\fB-attractor <macro/IO list>\fR" Specifies target hard macros, IOs, or fixed standard cell for attracting standard cells. Wildcards are supported.  Tool processes attractors in list one by one. If there are instances shared by different attractors, the locations of shared instances are determined by the later one. In that case, the placement result may vary with different order of objects in list.  "\fB-attractor_pin <pin_list>\fR" Places only standard cells connected with specified pins of attractors close to attractor. Wildcards are supported.  Without this setting, standard cells connected with all pins of attractors are pulled.  "\fB-before_points <instance_name>\fR" The attractor stops attracting before these instances.   "\fB-fixed\fR" Sets the placement status as fixed.  "\fB-instance_pin <instance/pin>\fR" Pulls all instances, instance pins, and IO pins specified in the list close to the attractor. This option requires only full instance pin name. Wildcards are not supported.  Option -attractor_pin needs to be used with this option.  "\fB-key_cell <cell_name>\fR" Places specified type of cells close to attractors, as well as other logics between the key cell and attractor. Wildcards are supported.  Without this setting, all standard cells connected with attractors are pulled.  "\fB-level <integer>\fR" Pulls all instances within certain logic level of connections to the attractor close to attractors.  This option is mutually exclusive with -sequential, and user must specify one of them.  "\fB-move_fixed\fR" Specifies that instances with the fixed status can also be moved close to the attractor.  "\fB-placed\fR" Specifies instances being placed is in placed status.  By default, the pulled cells are marked as softfixed.  "\fB-sequential <all_connected> | <direct_connected>\fR" Pulls sequential cells connected with the attractor close to the attractor.  all_connected: attracts all sequential cells from/to attractor; combinational logics between the sequential instance and attractor are attracted as well.  direct_connected: attracts sequential cells directly connected with attractor.  "\fB-stop_points <instance_name>\fR" Pulls all instances connected between the attractor and the specified stop point close to attractors. This option requires full instance name or instance pin name. Wildcards are supported. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places all instances directly connected with all pins of RAM1 close to RAM1.  place_connected -attractor RAM1 -level 1   "*" 2 The following command pulls all sequential cells from RAM1 and all combinational cells between RAM1 and the sequential cells close to RAM1.  place_connected -attractor RAM1 -sequential all_connected   "*" 2 Only the sequential cells from IN* pins of RAM1 and their combinational logics are caught to be placed nearby RAM1.  place_connected -attractor RAM1 -sequential all_connected -attractor_pin IN*   "*" 2 The following command picks out instances that are BUF1X cell type and directly connected with RAM1, and places them close to RAM1 with placed status.  place_connected -attractor RAM1 -level1 -key_cell BUF1X -placed   "*" 2 The following command places instances, C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, close to the attractor RAM1.   place_connected -attractor RAM1 -before_points {C5 C7}   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
