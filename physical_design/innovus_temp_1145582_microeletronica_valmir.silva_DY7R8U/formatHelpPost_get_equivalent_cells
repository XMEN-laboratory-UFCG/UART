.SH Name \fBget_equivalent_cells\fR \-  Returns equivalent cells from minimum/maximum libraries or from libraries of specific power domains
.SH Syntax \fBget_equivalent_cells\fR  [-help]  -cell <string>[ [ { { -delay_corner <string> [ -early_only | -late_only ] } | -max |-min } [ -power_domain <string>] ] | -library <string>] 
.P Returns equivalent cells from minimum/maximum libraries or from libraries of specific power domains. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-cell string \fR" Specifies the cell name for which equivalent cells will be fetched.   "\fB-delay_corner string\fR" Specifies delay corner for which equivalent cells from libraries will be fetched.   "\fB-early_only\fR" Fetches cells only for early libraries of the specified delay corner.   "\fB-late_only\fR" Fetches cells only for late libraries of the specified delay corner.   "\fB-library string\fR" Specifies the library for which cells will be fetched.   "\fB-max\fR" Fetches equivalent cells for max libraries only.   "\fB-min\fR" Fetches equivalent cells for min libraries only.   "\fB-power_domain string\fR" Fetches cells for libraries of a specific power domain. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command will return all the cells equivalent to BUF_X4 (buffers) present in the power domain PD1 in the max libraries:  > get_equivalent_cells -cell BUF_X4 -max -power_domain PD1  Output:   CORELIB/BUF_X1 CORELIB/BUF_X16 CORELIB/BUF_X2 CORELIB/BUF_X32 CORELIB/BUF_X4   "*" 2 The following command will return all the AND cells of different drives present in the library USERLIB:  > get_equivalent_cells -cell AND_X8 -library USERLIB
