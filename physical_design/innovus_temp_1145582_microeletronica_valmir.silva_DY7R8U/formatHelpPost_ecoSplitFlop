.SH Name \fBecoSplitFlop\fR \-  Splits a multi-bit flip-flop (MBFF) into single-bit flip-flops for the specified instance. By default, a specific flip-flop is split only if equivalent single-bit flip-flops can be found in libraries and there is timing gain after the split

.P Splits a multi-bit flip-flop (MBFF) into single-bit flip-flops for the specified instance. By default, a specific flip-flop is split only if equivalent single-bit flip-flops can be found in libraries and there is timing gain after the split. You can also specify that the split flip-flops should be placed in legal locations. By default, the positions of the split flip-flops are not guaranteed to be legal.
.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This command is not controlled by the  -multiBitFlopOpt parameter  setting of setOptMode.  "*" 2 The command calls refinePlace at the end. To disable this, use setEcoMode -refinePlace false  "*" 2 MBFFs must be identified by the the command reportMultiBitFFs -all   "*" 2 A placeable location for the split FFs is required

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ecoSplitFlop parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man ecoSplitFlop  "\fB-all\fR" When specified, splits all MBFFs into smaller-bit flip-flops including single-bit flip-flops (SBFFs). Only timing critical bits are split into single-bit flops, and the remaining, non-critical bits, are split into smaller bit width MBFFs, to preserve power as much as possible.  For example, a 4-bit MBFF may be split into two single-bit flops and one 2-bit flop.   Note: The -all, -inst and -listFile parameters are mutually exclusive. If the -all parameter is not specified, one of these two parameters, -inst or -listFile, must be specified.  Default: false  "\fB-batch\fR" When specified, splits the MBFFs in batches.  For example,  ecoSplitFlop -listFile <list> -postCTS -batch -force  Default: false  "\fB-force\fR" Forces the flip-flop splits irrespective of timing gains.  Default: false  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 If there is no timing gain and this parameter is not specified, the flip-flops for the specified instance will not be split.  "*" 2 If this option is set along with the -legal option, the software will first look for legal locations. However, the flip-flops will be split even if no legal location is found.
.RE   "\fB-fullSplit\fR" Forces the MBFFs to be completely split into all single-bit flip-flops.   "\fB-inst <flopInstName> | {{Mbff1 flopCell1} {Mbff2 flopCell2}...}\fR" Specifies pairs of MBFFs to be split and the corresponding single-bit flops to be used. You can also specify the names of the flop instances to be split. You can specify a single instance or a tcl list of instances to be split.  Note: The -all, -inst and -listFile parameters are mutually exclusive. If the -all parameter is not specified, one of these two parameters, -inst or -listFile, must be specified.  "\fB-listFile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the file containing pairs of MBFFs to be split and the corresponding single-bit flops to be used. You can also just specify the names of MBFF instances to be split. You can specify up to 50,000 instances to split. Specify each instance on a line and comment with #. Instance name should not contain spaces or backslashes.  Note: The -all, -inst and -listFile parameters are mutually exclusive. If the -all parameter is not specified, one of these two parameters, -inst or -listFile, must be specified.  "\fB-legal\fR" Places the split flip-flops at legal locations.  Note: If both the -legal and -force parameters are specified, the software will first look for legal locations. However, the flip-flops will be split even if no legal location is found. In this case, the split instances will be placed in the original location of the MBFFs.  Default: false  "\fB-power\fR" Splits the flip-flop for power purpose.  Default: false  "\fB-preCTS \fR" Specify this parameter, if the design stage is preCTS.  Default: -postRoute  "\fB-postCTS\fR" Specify this parameter, if the design stage is postCTS.  Default: -postRoute  "\fB-postRoute\fR" Specify this parameter, if the design stage is postRoute. This is the default setting.  Note: One of the three options, -preCTS, -postCTS, or -postRoute must be specified.  "\fB-skipRoute\fR" Specify if the stage is postRoute and globalDetailRoute is not required to be performed after the split. Since postRoute is also the default stage, globalDetailRoute is also skipped when the stage is default and -skipRoute is specified. However, for the default case, when the stage is postRoute but this parameter is not specified, after splitting the instances, globalDetailRoute will be called.  Default: false 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command will force the flip-flop split for the instance, ff_0 during the preCTS stage:  ecoSplitFlop -preCTS -inst ff_0 -force  "*" 2 The following command will will try to split for power all MBFFs during the postCTS stage:  ecoSplitFlop -power -all -postCTS
