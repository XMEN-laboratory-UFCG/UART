.SH Name \fBoaOut\fR \-  Saves floorplan, placement, and routing data in the OpenAccess format
.SH Syntax \fBoaOut\fR  [-help]   <lib>  <cell>  <view>   [-autoRemaster]  [-copyTechFromReflib]  [-cutRows]  [-early_global_route]  [-leafViewNames {<lefView1 lefView2

...>}]  
.P Saves floorplan, placement, and routing data in the OpenAccess format.
.P You can use the oaOut command after importing the design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each oaOut parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man oaOut.  "\fB<lib>\fR" Specifies the target OpenAccess library name.  "\fB<cell>\fR" Specifies the target cell name.  "\fB<view>\fR" Specifies the target view name.  "\fB-autoRemaster\fR" Overrides the reference libraries and leaf view names specified binding, and utilizes the cell layout viewing binding stored on the library cell master for each leaf cell (stored in the library cell's layout library and layout view attributes).  The binding can be specified using the set_cell_binding command.  "\fB-copyTechFromReflib\fR" Copies the technology file to the current design library.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, Innovus attaches the technology to the current design library.  Note: This parameter applies only when you create libraries.  "\fB-cutRows\fR" Specifies that rows are cut against placement obstructions and block halos, similar to the behavior of the defOut command.  Default: Does not cut rows.  "\fB-early_global_route\fR" Writes out a design containing Early Global Route data.  "\fB-leafViewNames <{lefView1 lefView2>
...}\fR" Specifies a list of view names to be searched during leaf cell instance binding.  "\fB-noConnectivity\fR" This option should be used if the OpenAccess layout cellviews that are being used in remastering (-autoRemaster or -refLibs/-leafViewNames) do not have any terminals (as is the case when the layout cellview is created from GDSII/Stream data), in which case it is not possible to maintain netlist connectivity. Writes out a design that contains instances and physical shapes. When specified, the software creates an OpenAccess module domain using the instance hierarchy, but does not attempt to create any nets, pins, or instance pins.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) Designs written out using the  -noConnectivity parameter cannot be reloaded into the Innovus software.   "\fB-noOverwriteAbstract\fR" Prevents the software from overwriting abstracts of partitions and blackboxes.  Default: Innovus overwrites abstracts of partitions and blackboxes. Innovus never overwrites abstracts of library data.  "\fB-noStdCells\fR" Does not save instances of core cells to the OpenAccess database. However, if an instance is either fixed or covered, it is saved to the database.  Use this parameter if you just need the preliminary design for DRC checks of the floorplan. In such cases, leaving out the standard cell information makes the file smaller and reduces the DRC run time.  Note: The -noStdCells parameter must be used with the -noConnectivity parameter.  "\fB-refLibs {<refLib1 refLib2
...>}\fR" Specifies the names of the external libraries that will contain the leaf cell masters, LEF abstract, and technology file. This parameter only accepts library names, not paths. The mapping between the external library name and its path is defined in the cds.lib file. Innovus references technology information only from the first library in the list of libraries.
