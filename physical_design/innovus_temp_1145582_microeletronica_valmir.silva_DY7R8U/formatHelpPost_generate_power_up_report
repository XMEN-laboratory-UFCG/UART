.SH Name \fBgenerate_power_up_report\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBgenerate_power_up_report\fR  [-help]  [-switch_net <net_name>]  -output_directory <directory_name>  -state_directory <directory_name>  Specifies to generate power-up statistics report to view the ramp up/inrush current, worst power switch voltage, and additional instance voltage data (average, median, max, and standard deviation voltage data versus time) for the powering-up rail. The following files are generated in the GIF and text formats:
.RS  "*" 2 average voltage of instances (.avgV)  "*" 2 max voltage of instances (.maxV)  "*" 2 min voltage of instances (.minV)  "*" 2 median of instance voltages (.medianV)  "*" 2 standard deviation of instance voltages (.deltaV)  "*" 2 total inrush current (.inrushI)  "*" 2 average voltage of power gates (.avgV)  "*" 2 max voltage of power gates (.maxV)  "*" 2 min voltage of power gates (.minV)  "*" 2 median of power gate voltages (.medianV)  "*" 2 standard deviation of power gate voltages (.deltaV)

.SH Parameters    "\fB-switch_net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the powering up rail for which you want to generate detailed power-up statistics.   "\fB-output_directory <directory_name>   \fR" Specifies the output directory in which the power-up statistics results will be saved in.   "\fB-state_directory <directory_name>   \fR" Specifies the top-level state directory that is generated by IR drop analysis. This state directory contains analysis of all nets associated with the power domain; for example, core_25C_dynamic_1.
