.TH placeSdpGroup  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBplaceSdpGroup\fR \-  Places elements or instances of all defined SDP groups in row(s) and column(s) based on user-defined relative placement information
.SH Syntax \fBplaceSdpGroup\fR  [-help]  [-create_inst_group]    [-deleteOverlap {<cell...>} {<sdp name...>}]   [-sdpGroups {<name...>}]   [-noResolveOverlap | [-keepSdpArea]]
.P Places elements or instances of all defined SDP groups in row(s) and column(s) based on user-defined relative placement information. The placeSdpGroup command:
.RS  "*" 2 Adjusts the core boundary automatically if the existing core is not big enough for placing all specified SDPs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Resolves automatically the overlaps on the row/column cell list specified in setSdpMode.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Honors the alignByPinName SDP constraint for column groups
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Marks all placed SDP instances to fixed status
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Places the SDP boundary outside the die area on the right hand side if origin information is not defined.
.RE
.P Before placing SDP groups, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Imported the design
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Defined SDPs using TCL commands or modified SDPs, as required
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description of the placeSdpGroup command.  For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man placeSdpGroup.  "\fB-create_inst_group\fR" Converts failed top sdp groups to instance groups.   In the 2G flow, the tool supports the conversion of failed top SDP groups to instGroups by using this parameter. This option works only on top SDPs. This means the tool will convert the top SDPs to instGroups, irrespective of whether it was the top SDPs or child SDPs that failed.  The instances in the instance groups are soft_fixed.  "\fB-deleteOverlap {<cell...>} {<sdp name...>}\fR" Deletes specified physical cells that overlap with all or specified SDP groups.  Note: If you do not specify <sdp name
...>, the specified physical cells are removed for all SDPs.  "\fB-keepSdpArea\fR" Keeps the original SDP structure when resolving overlaps with other instances. Use this option if you want to resolve the cell overlap by moving the SDP structure instead of changing it.  "\fB-noResolveOverlap\fR" Ignores overlaps with column/row cells that are specified in setSdpMode. Use this option to take a look at how the groups will be placed before resolving overlaps.  "\fB-sdpGroups {<name...>}\fR" Places only the specified SDP groups. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places all defined SDP groups without removing overlaps:   placeSdpGroup -noResolveOverlap
