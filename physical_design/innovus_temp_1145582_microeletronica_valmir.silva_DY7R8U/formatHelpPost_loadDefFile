.SH Name \fBloadDefFile\fR \-  Reads a DEF file to build the in-memory database in Innovus
.SH Syntax \fBloadDefFile\fR  [-help]   <defFile>  [-hier [-stub <stubfile> | -reflib {<listOfRefLibs>}]] 
.P Reads a DEF file to build the in-memory database in Innovus. You can then continue to use other Innovus commands.
.P You can use the loadDefFile command after running the loadLefFile command.
.P When a list of OpenAccess reference libraries is specified, loadLefFile is not required before loadDefFile; otherwise, use this command after you load the library information.
.P After loading the DEF netlist, you can perform floorplanning, non-timing driven placement and routing, wire editing, and verification. You cannot use the DEF netlist flow for parasitic extraction, delay calculation, and timing-driven placement and routing effectively because the DEF names do not properly match the Verilog names used in timing constraints and timing analysis. 
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each parameter of the loadDefFile command.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man loadDefFile.  "\fB<defFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the DEF file to load.  "\fB<->reflib<listOfRefLibs>\fR" Specifies a list of OpenAccess reference libraries to load.  When specified, the reference libraries are assumed to be correct by construction and verilogAnnotate is not run. This reference library is used for def2oa. Because the reference libraries are already provided, there is no need to use loadLefFile with this option.  "\fB<->hier\fR" Preserves the design hierarchy.  When specified, creates a reference library by calling lef2oa. It will also create stub (stub.v) from pre-loaded LEF files. This stub will be used to run verilogAnnotate on reference libraries created by the lef2oa command. The reference library created this way is used by def2oa.  "\fB<->stub<stubfile>\fR" Specifies the name of the stub file to load.  This option can be specified only with -hier. When specified, the stub file is used in verilogAnnotate. Stub is not created internally from LEF files.
