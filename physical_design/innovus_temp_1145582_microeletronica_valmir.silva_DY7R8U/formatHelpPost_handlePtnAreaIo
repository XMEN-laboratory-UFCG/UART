.SH Name \fBhandlePtnAreaIo\fR \-  Specifies the name of the buffer to be used for feedthrough insertion in a flip chip design
.SH Syntax \fBhandlePtnAreaIo\fR  [-insertBuffer <bufferName> | -noInsertBuffer]   [-top <extension>]   [-bottom <extension>]   [-left <extension>]   [-right <extension>]   [-selectedCell]   [-pinOnBoundary] 
.P Specifies the name of the buffer to be used for feedthrough insertion in a flip chip design. Use this command before partitioning the flip chip design. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-bottom <extension>\fR" Specifies how far, in microns, to expand the Area I/O cell box in the bottom direction when determining the size of the placement and routing obstructions to be pushed down.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-insertBuffer <bufferName>\fR" Specifies either the name of the buffer, or that there are no buffers to be inserted.  Default: -noInsertBuffer  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-left <extension>\fR" Specifies how far, in microns, to expand the Area I/O cell box in the left direction when determining the size of the placement and routing obstructions to be pushed down.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-noInsertBuffer\fR" Specifies that no buffers are to be inserted.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pinOnBoundary\fR" Specifies the internal pin created to be placed at the intersection of the hole punch (placement obstruction) and the space reserved for the partition. If it is not specified, the default is that the internal pin is placed directly on top of the area I/O cell.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-right <extension>\fR" Specifies how far, in microns, to expand the Area I/O cell box in the right direction when determining the size of the placement and routing obstructions to be pushed down.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-selectedCell\fR" Specifies hole punches for all currently selected cells that overlap partitions if they are Area I/O cells. If you do not specify this parameter, the command specifies hole punches for all Area I/O cells that overlap partitions.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-top <extension>\fR" Specifies how far, in microns, to expand the Area I/O cell box in the top direction when determining the size of the placement and routing obstructions to be pushed down.  Data_type: int, optional
