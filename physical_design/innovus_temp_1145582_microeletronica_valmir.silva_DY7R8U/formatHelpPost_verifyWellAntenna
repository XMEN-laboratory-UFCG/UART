.SH Name \fBverifyWellAntenna\fR \-  Checks for any CORE rows that have well-process-antenna violations
.SH Syntax \fBverifyWellAntenna\fR  [-help]   [-needToProtect {<cell_list>}]   [-changeToProtect {<cell_list>}]   [-changeToNotProtect {<cell_list>}]   [-report <filename> [-detailed]] 
.P Checks for any CORE rows that have well-process-antenna violations. Well-process-antenna violations are normally caused by rows with decap cells that do not have any protecting cells in the same row. This command marks with a violation marker any such CORE cell. You can then write a Tcl script to put in a well-antenna cell next to the violation marker. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyWellAntenna parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man verifyWellAntenna  "\fB-changeToNotProtect {<cell_list>}\fR" Specifies the cell names that are to be marked as cells that do not protect rows. By default, the cells with LEF class CORE but without a subclass (e.g. normal BUF and AND2 cells) are assumed to have a well discharge path that protects a row from well-antenna violations. Use -changeToNotProtect option to override the default for any of these cells that do not protect a row. Pattern matching with * is allowed in cell names.  "\fB-changeToProtect {<cell_list>}\fR" Specifies the cell names that are to be marked as protection cells. By default, cells with CLASS CORE and a subclass {FEEDTHRU | TIEHIGH | TIELOW | SPACER | ANTENNACELL | WELLTAP} or cells with class ENDCAP (with or without any subclass) do not have a well-discharge path to protect a row. Use the -changeToProtect option to override the default for any of these cells that do protect the row. Pattern matching with * is allowed.  "\fB-needToProtect {<cell_list>}\fR" Specifies the cell names that need protection (typically decap cells). This option also indicates that the specified cells do not protect the row they are in. Pattern matching with * is allowed in cell names.  "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the report file name. By default, the report includes information about only the cells that you specified with the options.  "\fB-detailed\fR" If you specify -detailed,  verifyWellAntenna reports every class  CORE and  ENDCAP cell with its subclass and protection status to the  <filename> report. 
.SH Example
.P Normally, the decap cells are the only cells that need protection. However, if the standard-cell library in your design has one of the ENDCAP cells with a well-antenna protection device built-in, and the filler, well-tap, tie-high and tie-low cells are just class CORE rather than with the correct CORE sub-class, you can use the following command:
.P verifyWellAntenna -needToProtect decap* -changeToProtect wellAntEndCap -changeToNotProtect {filler* welltap* tie*} -report wellant.rpt
