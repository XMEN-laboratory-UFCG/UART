.SH Name \fBverifyEndCap\fR \-  Checks whether pre/post cap cells have been inserted correctly based on setEndCapMode settings
.SH Syntax \fBverifyEndCap\fR  [-help]  [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]   [-coreBoundaryOnly]  [-error <integer>]  [-ignore_macro <SCLA,...>]   [-powerDomain <string>]  [-report <filename>]   [-row <string>]  [-tripleWell]   [-wrongLocation]  
.P Checks whether pre/post cap cells have been inserted correctly based on setEndCapMode settings. Use this command after running addEndCap to flag violations such as:
.RS  "*" 2 Inserted end cap cell is of wrong type
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 End cap cell is missing
.RE
.P If you use verifyEndCap with the -wrongLocation option, it also checks whether the end cap cells are inserted in the right location. Use the -powerDomain option to check end cap cells inserted for a specific power domain.
.P Additionally, you can use verifyEndCap -tripleWell to check triple well insertion. Triple well technology is used to isolate p-well from substrate using a deep n-well.
.P You can view the violation markers generated by verifyEndCap in Violation Browser. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyEndCap parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man verifyEndCap  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the area in which endcaps are to be verified.   "\fB-coreBoundaryOnly\fR" Checks endcaps only at the core-boundary and not abutting obstructions.  Note: The -coreBoundaryOnly option does not support triple well cap insertion.  "\fB-error integer\fR" Specifies the maximum number of errors to report.  "\fB-ignore_macro <SCLA,...>\fR" Specifies the macro to be ignored.   "\fB-powerDomain string\fR" Specifies the power domain to be checked. Use this option to check end cap cells inserted for the specified power domain.  "\fB-report filename\fR" Specifies the file name for the verifyEndCap report.  "\fB-row string\fR" Specifies the row to check.  "\fB-tripleWell\fR" Checks triple well insertion. Only checks the cell lists specified in setEndCapMode.  "\fB-wrongLocation\fR" Checks for cap cells that are not inserted in the right location. If you specify this option, verifyEndCap marks with a violation marker any cap cell that is not on the beginning/end of the row or not on the boundary of the design/ block design. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following set of commands verifies whether cap cell insertion is as per the setEndCapMode settings and generates a default report file in the active folder:   setEndCapMode -leftEdge EC_LE10 -rightEdge EC_RE10  verifyEndCap
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command verifies end cap insertion and generates a report named endcap.rpt:   setEndCapMode -leftEdge EC_LE10 -rightEdge EC_RE10  verifyEndCap -report endcap.rpt
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command verifies triple well insertion. It also checks the cap cells that are not inserted in the right location and reports up to 10000 errors:   setEndCapMode -leftEdge EC_LE10 -rightEdge EC_RE10 -bottomEdge EC_BE10 \\                -leftBottomCorner EC_LBC10 -leftTopCorner EC_LTC10 \\                -rightBottomCorner EC_RBC10 -rightTopCorner EC_RTC10 \\                -topEdge EC_TE10  verifyEndCap -tripleWell -wrongLocation -error 10000
