.TH place_partition_clone  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBplace_partition_clone\fR \-  Places the clones, set their orientation and syncs up the data with other hierarchical instances (master and clones) of the same module
.SH Syntax \fBplace_partition_clone\fR  [-help]   -hinst <partition_clone_hinst_name>  -location {<x y>}   [-orient {R0 R180 MX MY}]   [-skip_sync]   [-sync_objs {placeBlockage routeBlockage pinBlockage macros fences}]
.P Places the clones, set their orientation and syncs up the data with other hierarchical instances (master and clones) of the same module. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each place_partition_clone parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man place_partition_clone  "\fB-hinst <partition_clone_hinst_name>\fR" Specifies the name of partition clone hierarchical instance.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-location {<x y>}\fR" Specifies location of the clone partition.  Data_type: point, required  "\fB-orient {R0 R180 MX MY}\fR" Specifies orientation of the clone partition. The orientation can be one of the following: R0, R180, MX, and MY  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-skip_sync\fR" When specified, the tool skips the sync-up of reference hinst (-hinst) objects with other hinsts of the same module.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-sync_objs {placeBlockage routeBlockage pinBlockage macros fences}\fR" When specified, the tool does the sync-up of the specified objects from reference hinst with other hinsts of same module. The objects that can be synced up include placeBlockage, routeBlockage, pinBlockage, macros, and  fences.  Data_type: string, optional

.P Hinst: A1 (master), A2 (clone), A3(clone), A4 (clone) 
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands places the clone A2 at location 2,5. If partition block has FP/def/route objs/data present, the command will sync the data from A2 to all other hinsts (A1 (master), A3 , A4 (clones)).  place_partition_clones -hinst A2 -location {2 5}   "*" 2 The following commands places the clone A3 at location 12,15 and changes the orientation to R180 (if not already R180). If partition block has FP/def/route objs/data present, the command will sync the data from A3 to all other hinsts (A1 (master), A2 , A4 (clones))  place_partition_clones -hinst A3 -location {12 15} -orient R180  "*" 2 The following commands places the master A1 at location 22,25. If partition block has FP/def/route objs/data present, the command will sync the data from A1 to all other hinsts (A2, A3, A4 (clones)).  place_partition_clones -hinst A1 -location {22 25}  "*" 2 The following commands places the master A1 at location 22,25. If partition block has FP/def/route objs/data present, the command will not sync any data to other hinsts.  place_partition_clones -hinst A1 -location {22 25} -skip_sync  "*" 2 The following commands places the clone A3 at location 12,15 and changes the orientation to R180 (if not already R180). If partition block has FP/def/route objs/data present, the command will not sync any data to other hinsts.  place_partition_clones -hinst A3 -location {12 15} -orient R180 -skip_sync  "*" 2 The following commands places the clone A3 at location 12,15 and changes the orientation to R180 (if not already R180). If partition block has FP/def/route objs/data present, the command will sync the bus-guide data from A3 to all other hinsts (A1 (master), A2 , A4 (clones)).  place_partition_clones -hinst A3 -location {12 15} -orient R180 -sync_obj {bus_guide}
