.SH Name \fBdelaycal_rd_rnet_fraction_threshold\fR \-  Default: 0.000000
.P Specifies the ratio of drive resistance to net resistance at which special handling of early path delays is invoked
.SH Syntax \fBdelaycal_rd_rnet_fraction_threshold\fR   Type: Double
.P Default: 0.000000
.P Specifies the ratio of drive resistance to net resistance at which special handling of early path delays is invoked. When active, slews across early delay path nets are not degraded.  
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following global variable specifies the Rd / Rnet threshold to be 1.0 for which early net slews are not degraded:        set delaycal_rd_rnet_fraction_threshold 1.0
