.SH Name \fBtiming_apply_default_primary_input_assertion\fR \-  When set to true, primary input and bidirectional ports that do not have an explicit arrival time specified (through the set_input_delay constraint), are provided a default arrival time
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_apply_default_primary_input_assertion\fR  {true | false}  Default: true 
.P When set to true, primary input and bidirectional ports that do not have an explicit arrival time specified (through the set_input_delay constraint), are provided a default arrival time. The arrival is referenced to an internal default clock that is indicated by the @ sign in various timing reports.
.P If a set_input_delay constraint is assigned to the input port, but the -clock parameter was not specified, the software assumes the constraint to be with reference to the default clock.
.P When set to false, inputs ports with no explicit set_input_delay are unconstrained for sequential timing analysis.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
