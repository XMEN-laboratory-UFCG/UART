.SH Name \fBtiming_extract_model_case_analysis_in_library\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_extract_model_case_analysis_in_library\fR   {true | false}
.P Default: true
.P Enables the software to model the constants as a function in the extracted timing model.
.P When set to true, the software models constants as functions in the library if these propagate to the output port.
.P When set to false, instead of modeling constants as functions inside the library, these are written as set_case_analysis in the constraints file (*.asrt).
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
