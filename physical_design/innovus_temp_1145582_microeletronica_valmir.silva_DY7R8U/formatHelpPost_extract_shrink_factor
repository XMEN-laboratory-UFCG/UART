.SH Name \fBextract_shrink_factor\fR
.SH Syntax \fBextract_shrink_factor\fR <shrink_factor_value> 
.P Type: Double
.P Default: 1.0
.P Specifies the shrink factor by which to shrink the design before extraction. The shrink factor is used only for extraction calculations. It does not change the actual design.
.P This global variable must only be used when restoring design.
.P Note: This global is not recommended for newer technologies where shrink factor is defined in the Quantus techfiles or capacitance tables.
.P To set this global, use the set command. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following global variable sets the shrink factor to 0.9:   set extract_shrink_factor 0.9  Setting the shrink factor to 0.9 means the value of wire lengths, widths, and spacings in the design will shrink to 90% of their original values.
