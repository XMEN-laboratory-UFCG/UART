.P Builds a Liberty (.lib) format model for the top cell, which is the timing model equivalent of the original design. The model is extracted for the given analysis modes, PVT conditions, and parasitics. If any one of these parameters change, then you must extract the model again. The model is extracted for a range of input slews and load capacitances. If you do not specify these ranges, the software automatically computes the default values. The extracted model defines all of the top-level ports of the design as pins. Additionally, all other design pins that are targets of create_clock or create_generated_clock are retained as internal pins.
.P For model extraction, your design must be properly constrained. For example, no clock or data conflicts can be present. Use the check_timing command and correct all errors prior to model extraction.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-abs_tol_val <float>\fR" Specifies the absolute tolerance value to be used during the validation of the extracted timing model. For more details, refer to the compare_model_timing -absolute_tolerance command option.  This parameter can be used only when the -validate option is specified.  The integer value specified with this option is read as ns/ps depending upon the time unit.  Default: 3ps  "\fB-abs_tol_val_optimistic <float>  \fR" Specifies the absolute tolerance limit for flagging an optimistic failure. An optimistic path violating the absolute as well as percentage tolerance limit will be flagged as FAIL in the compare_model_timing command output report.  You can use the this parameter when the -validate is used with model extraction.  Default: 15ps  "\fB--abs_tol_val_pessimistic <float>  \fR" Specifies the absolute tolerance limit for flagging a pessimistic failure. A pessimistic path violating the absolute as well as percentage tolerance limit will be flagged as FAIL in the check_timing_model command output report.  You can use the this parameter when the -validate is used with model extraction.  Default: 15ps  "\fB-assertions <constraint filename>\fR" Dumps the constraints for a model, which is used in the validation flow.  Default: model.asrt  "\fB-cell_name <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the cell name used in the timing model.  Default: The name of the top cell to be extracted.  "\fB-check\fR" Checks the extracted timing model for any possible liberty related issue. When specified, the command displays detailed error and warning messages, and their summary.   "\fB-clock_slews {<clk_slew1 clk_slew2>...}\fR" Specifies a range of slew values used at all clock pins. The list of values must be enclosed by curly braces. If this parameter is not specified, the software automatically computes the appropriate values.  "\fB-format <string>\fR" Specifies the format for the extracted model in tlf, dotlib, or syntech.  "\fB-gain <integer>\fR" Represents an increase in the number of delay arcs if a pin is removed. This option reduces the extracted model size in scenarios where removing a pin can result in increased model size. The gain at an internal pin can be defined as:  (number of incoming delay arcs * number of outgoing delay arcs) - (number of incoming delay arcs + number of outgoing delay arcs  If an internal pin has a gain greater than the specified number, then that pin needs to be preserved in order to reduce the extracted model size.  Default: 0  "\fB-include_aocv_weights\fR" Writes the stage weight on individual arcs. Before using this option, it is mandatory that the AOCV libraries are read in and AOCV analysis is enabled (by using setAnalysisMode -aocv true). The weights written in ETM are not meant to derate the model. Model itself will be containing the derated delays. The stage weight extracted on arcs will be used to calculate the stage count of chip level paths going across the ETM. The stage weights in the extracted model are dumped as user defined attributes. This will require defining two attributes at arc level.

.RS  "*" 2 define ("clock_aocv_weight","timing","float");
.RE   The first attribute will be used for combinational and trigger arc and will be dumped at arc level as below.  timing () {  timing_type : combinational;  timing_sense : positive_unate;  aocv_weight : 4; 
.  }  The check arcs will be dumped with two separate stage weights for data and clock.  timing () {  timing_type : setup_rising;  aocv_weight : 4;  clock_aocv_weight : 3; 
.  }  "\fB-input_slews {<input_slew1> <input_slew2>
...}\fR" Specifies a range of slew values used at all input pins. Enclose the list of values with curly braces. If this parameter is not specified, the software automatically computes the appropriate values.  "\fB-lib_name <lib_name>\fR" Specifies the library name used in the timing model. Write extracted timing models in the liberty format by specifying the
.lib file suffix.  Default: The name of the top cell to be extracted.  "\fB-max_num_loads <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of output load values used for delay arc characterization. A low value of 1 or 2 improves runtime and memory usage but may significantly degrade model accuracy. Use this parameter only if the model size or model extraction time is critical.  Default: 64  "\fB-max_num_slews <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of input slews or clock slews used for delay and check arc characterization. Specifying a low value of 1 or 2 improves runtime and memory but may significantly degrade model accuracy. Using the -max_num_slews parameter has a larger impact on runtime and memory than the -max_num_loads parameter. Use this parameter only if the model size or the model extraction time is critical.  Default: 64  The max_num_slews and max_num_loads parameters specify only the maximum limits on how many slew and load points are chosen. The software scans the gates connected to the input and output ports to calculate the number of points.  "\fB<model_filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file.  Avoid problems with rebind by using the -lib_name and -cell_name parameters instead of using the default names.  "\fB-output_loads {<output_load1><output_load2>
...} \fR" Specifies a range of load values used at all output pins. Enclose the list of values by curly braces. If this parameter is not specified, the software automatically computes the appropriate values.  "\fB-per_tol_val <float>\fR" Specifies the percentage tolerance value to be used during the validation of extracted ETM. This option can be used only when -validate option is also specified.  For more details refer to compare_model_timingcompare_model_timing-percent_tolerance.  Default: 3%  "\fB-per_tol_val_optimistic <float>  \fR" Specifies the percentage tolerance limit for flagging an optimistic failure. An optimistic path violating percentage as well as absolute tolerance limit will be flagged as FAIL in the compare_model_timingcompare_model_timing command output report.   You can use the this parameter when the -validate is used with model extraction.  Default: 3%  "\fB-per_tol_val_pessimistic <float>  \fR" Specifies the percentage tolerance limit for flagging a pessimistic failure. A pessimistic path violating percentage as well as absolute tolerance limit will be flagged as FAIL in the compare_model_timingcompare_model_timing command output report.  You can use the this parameter when the -validate is used with model extraction.  Default: 3%  "\fB-pg\fR" Allows power or ground related pin information to be extracted inside the extracted model.   "\fB-precision <integer>\fR" Specifies the floating point precision used for the timing model.  For example, the floating point precision for 3.0089 can be changed as follows: Precision      Data Value in
.lib  4                3.0089  3                    3.009  2                    3.01  1                    3.0  Default: 4  "\fB-resolution <float>\fR" Specifies the magnitude of delay difference that can be ignored by the extractor.  Default: 0.001  Type: Float  "\fB-tolerance <float>\fR" Specifies the accuracy level of extractor in percent. For example, 5.0 represents a plus or a minus 5.0 percent allowable error in the extracted model. The higher the tolerance, the faster the extraction time.  Default: 1.0  Type: Float  "\fB-validate <string>\fR" Validates the timing model generated for the corresponding view and displays the number of failures corresponding to setup and hold checks   "\fB-view <string>\fR" Specifies the current active view.    "\fB-verilog_shell_file <filename>\fR" Generates a Verilog shell file that instantiates the timing model. This parameter is useful for validating the model. Use the -verilog_shell_module parameter to specify the name of the top module in this Verilog file.  "\fB-verilog_shell_module <top_module_name>\fR" Specifies the top module name of the Verilog shell file.  Default: test_shell
