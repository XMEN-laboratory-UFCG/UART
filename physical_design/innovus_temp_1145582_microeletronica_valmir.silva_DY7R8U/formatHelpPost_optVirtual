.P This command is based on the gigaOpt infrastructure and it provides prototyping capability at several steps of the hierarchical flow to specify and refine the top-level timing constraints and floorplan. It performs, at preRoute stages, fast virtual optimization using buffering and driver resizing. This command updates the timing graph without modifying the netlist. Using gigaOpt infrastructure, the command has the following capabilities:
.RS  "*" 2 Provides a good  QoR (AAE DC,  gigaOpt global optimizer, and DRV-based)  "*" 2 Run in multi-threaded mode  "*" 2 Supports masters and clones
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each optVirtual parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man optVirtual.  "\fB-outDir <dirName>\fR" Specifies the name of the directory where the software writes timing reports. This parameter is used only when the -timingReports parameter is specified  "\fB-timingReports\fR" Generates timing reports that reflect virtual optimization.
