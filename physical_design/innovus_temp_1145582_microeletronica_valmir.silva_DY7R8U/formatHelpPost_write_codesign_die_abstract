.P Writes the abstract of current die to a file. It also writes the OBS for die edge checking to the die abstract file. Specify this command after the initial floorplan is loaded. The file will be imported by the adjacent die and therefore the current design will be honored by the adjacent die. The write_codesign_die_abstract command is similar to the writeDieAbstract except that the write_codesign_die_abstract command provides options for filtering portions of the abstract which may not be required for some flows. It also provides the option to write out a third-party die abstract for ICs that do not have TSVs.
.P This command supports the embedded bump flow for hierarchical designs. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each write_codesign_die_abstract parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man write_codesign_die_abstract  "\fB<DIEABSTRACTFILE>\fR" Specifies the name of the die abstract file.   "\fB-block_pin_layer_bottom <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the legal routing layer for block macros. If specified, the layers below the mentioned layer should not be the output to the die abstract.  If not specified, the default value is the next layer down from the top routing layer.   "\fB-block_pin_layer_top <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the legal routing layer for block macros. If given, the layers above the mentioned layer should not be the output to the die abstract.  "\fB-block_pin_minimum_size <x y>\fR" Defines the minimum size of the pin that will be output to the die abstract.  "\fB-block_pin_name_includes <pin_name>\fR" Specifies that only pins that contain the mentioned value will be in the output.  "\fB-bump_pin_layer_bottom <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the legal routing layers name for bump macros. If given, the layers below the specified layer are not to be output to the die abstract  "\fB-bump_pin_layer_top <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the legal routing layer name; used for bump macros. If given, the layers above the specified layer are not to be output to the die abstract.  "\fB-constraints <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the file that lists the constraints. This file will be read and the constraints will be applied to the design.  "\fB-die_shrink_by <num>\fR" Specifies the percentage by which the die should be shrunk. A typical shrink value is 10 (for a 10% optical shrink).  Default: 0  The default value, 0, indicates no shrink.  "\fB-die_thickness <num>\fR" Specifies the die thickness.  Default: 0  "\fB-include_macro_obstructions\fR" Specifies to give LEF macro OBS shapes in the output to the die abstract. By default, OBS obstructions are not included.  "\fB-io_macros <macro_names>\fR" Identifies the I/O macros that are to be written to the die abstract. If a macro is not specified, co-design is done at the bump level.  "\fB-io_pin_layer_bottom <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the legal routing layer name; used for I/O macros. If given, the layers below is not to be output to the die abstract.  "\fB-io_pin_layer_top <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the legal routing layers' name; used for I/O macros. If given, the layers above is not to be output to the die abstract.  "\fB-io_pin_minimum_size <pin_size>\fR" This parameter defines the minimum size of pin that will be output to the die abstract. The pin's x and y dimensions must be at least this value.  "\fB-io_pin_name_includes <pin_name>\fR" This string indicates that only pins that contain the string value will be output.  "\fB-layer_details\fR" When given, indicates that the layer_details is to be output to the die.  "\fB-macro_obstructions_layer_bottom <layer_name>\fR" If specified, identifies the bottom layer for which OBS shapes are exported to the die abstract. The default value for this option is the top metal layer.  "\fB-macro_obstructions_layer_top <layer_name>\fR" If specified, identifies the top layer for which OBS shapes are exported to the die abstract.    "\fB-no_block_macros\fR" Indicates that block macros should not be the output to the die abstract.  "\fB-no_blockages\fR" Indicates that blockages should not be the output to the die abstract.  "\fB-no_rdl_routing\fR" Indicates that the rdl routing should not be the output to the die abstract.  "\fB-power_routing\fR" Indicates that the power routing should not be the output to the die abstract.  "\fB-power_routing_layer_bottom <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the names of the legal routing layers for power routing. If given, the layers below are not to be output to the die abstract.  "\fB-power_routing_layer_top <layer_name>\fR" Specifies the names of legal routing layers for power routing. If given, the layers above are not output to the die abstract.  "\fB-rdl_routing_layer_bottom layer_name\fR" Specifies the names of legal routing layers for rdl routing. If given, the layers below are not to be output to the die abstract.   "\fB-rdl_routing_layer_top layer_name\fR" Specifies the names of legal routing layers for rdl routing. If given, the layers above are not to be output to the die abstract.   "\fB-scribe_all <distance_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance in microns from the die boundary to the edge of the silicon after being cut from the wafer from all sides.  "\fB-scribe_east <distance_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance in microns from the die boundary to the edge of the silicon after being cut from the wafer from the East side.  "\fB-scribe_north <distance_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance in microns from the die boundary to the edge of the silicon after being cut from the wafer from the North side.  "\fB-scribe_south <distance_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance in microns from the die boundary to the edge of the silicon after being cut from the wafer from the South side.  "\fB-scribe_west <distance_in_microns>\fR" Specifies the distance in microns from the die boundary to the edge of the silicon after being cut from the wafer from the West side.  "\fB-sealring_all <distance_in_microns>\fR" Species the distance of the seal ring from the die boundary on all sides. Seal ring is a border around the die boundary that is put in pre-shrink.  "\fB-sealring_east <distance_in_microns>\fR" Species the distance of the seal ring from the die boundary from the East side.   "\fB-sealring_north <distance_in_microns>\fR" Species the distance of the seal ring from the die boundary from the North side.
