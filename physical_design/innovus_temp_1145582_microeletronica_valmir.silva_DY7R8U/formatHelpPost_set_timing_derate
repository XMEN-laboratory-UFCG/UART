.SH Name \fBset_timing_derate\fR \-  Sets delay scaling or derating factors for early and late paths in the current design
.SH Syntax \fBset_timing_derate\fR  [-help]  <derate_value>[<object_list>]  [-add]  [-cell_check]  [-cell_delay]  [-clock]  [-clock_period_check]  [-corner]  [-data]  [-dynamic]  [-early]  [-fall]  [-increment]  [-input_switching]  [-late]  [-mean]  [-multiply]  [-net_delay]  [-power_domain <string>]  [-pulse_width_check]  [-retain_delay]  [-rise]  [-sigma]  [-static]   [-statistical]  [-transition]   [-min | -max | -delay_corner delayCornerName] 
.P Sets delay scaling or derating factors for early and late paths in the current design. You use this command to perform scaled on-chip variation around best-case and worst-case corners. The timing scaling factors affect the delay values generated in the timing reports. You can set scaling factors for data paths, clock paths, minimum and maximum operating conditions.
.P If you do not specify the -clock or -data parameter, the software applies the scaling factors to both clock and data paths. If you specify only one of the two parameters, -data or -clock, the software uses the last defined value for the other.
.P Similarly, if you do not specify the -min or -max parameter, the software applies the scaling factor to both minimum and maximum operating conditions. You should only use the -min or -max parameter for best-case worst-case analysis. If you specify them in on-chip variation (OCV) mode, the software will use the -min -early derating factor for early path scaling, and the -max -late derating factor for late path adjustments.
.P When there are separate max and min libraries specified, only those set_timing_derate constraints are honored that are specified with max library. The constraints specified with min library are ignored.
.P In MMMC mode, for delay corners having different late and early library sets, only those set_timing_derate constraints are honored that are specified with late library set of the delay corner. The constraints specified with early library set are ignored.
.P Note: The set_timing_derate command can only be used on the command line. You cannot import it as part of an SDC file. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-add\fR" Incrementally adds or subtracts derates. You can also apply derates on specific leaf instances.  "\fB-cell_check\fR" Specifies scaling on timing checks. Use the -cell_check option with the -early option to specify scaling on hold arcs and use with the -late option to specify scaling on setup arcs.  When you specify this parameter, derating factors are also applied to user constraints such as set_output_delay, set_data_check, and set_clock_gating_check.  The -cell_check parameter by default does not apply check derate to output external delay (e.g., set_output_delay). To enable this feature, you can set the timing_apply_check_derate_to_external_output_delay timing global variable to true. When set to true, this global applies cell derate to the top boundary port.  "\fB-cell_delay\fR" Specifies scaling on cell delays.  If neither the -cell_delay nor the -net_delay option is specified, the specified scaling factor applies to both types of delays.  "\fB-clock \fR" Applies the derating factors to clock paths only.  "\fB-clock_period_check\fR" Specifies derate values for clock period checks.  "\fB-corner\fR" Applies derating on cells or nets that are modeled as corner data elements. The specified derating factor is applied to both the mean and sensitivities of the delays (corner objects can have propagated sensitivities).  A cell with no timing arc data in a library that has any sensitivity information with respect to any parameter defined in SPDF are considered as a corner object. All cells that do not qualify are considered to be statistical objects.   A net with parasitic data that has no sensitivity information with respect to any parameter defined in SPDF is considered as a corner object. All nets that do not qualify are considered to be statistical objects.  "\fB-data \fR" Applies the derating factors to data paths only.  "\fB-delay_corner <delayCornerName>\fR" Applies the derating factor to the specified delay calculation corner or a list of delay corners.  Note: The timing derate can be applied to corners associated with active views only.  "\fB<derate_value>\fR" Specifies the derating value to be used.  "\fB-dynamic\fR" Applies the specified derating factor to the delta portion of net delays only.  You can specify -net_delay or -cell_delay parameter with the -dynamic parameter.  You cannot specify -dynamic with -mean or -sigma parameters.  "\fB-early \fR" Specifies that the derating factor applies to early paths. Early paths are launching clock during hold analysis, receiving clock during setup analysis and datapath during hold analysis. For definition of early and late paths, see EarlyLatePaths in Innovus User Guide.  Note: To use this parameter, you must specify -delay_corner.  "\fB-fall\fR" Applies the derating factor to falling delay and check arcs based on the transition direction at the arc's sink pin.  This parameter can be used to selectively apply timing derates for the fall arcs (cell, net, or check arcs).  "\fB-increment\fR" Incrementally adds the derate value to the total derate value in all the modes - OCV, AOCV, and SOCV mode.   "\fB-input_switching\fR" Considers the given derate as simultaneous switching input (SSI) derate that is applicable to early paths only.   "\fB-late \fR" Specifies that the derating factor applies to late paths. Late paths are receiving clock during hold analysis, launching clock during setup analysis and datapath during setup analysis.  Note: To use this parameter, you must specify the -delay_corner parameter.  "\fB-max\fR" Applies the derating factor to the maximum operating condition during best-case worst-case analysis. This parameter is ignored during on-chip variation analysis.  Note: You cannot use the -max parameter when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner (MMMC) mode. You must use the -delay_corner parameter instead.  "\fB-min\fR" Applies the derating factor to the minimum operating condition during best-case worst-case analysis. This parameter is ignored during on-chip variation analysis.  Note: You cannot use the -min parameter when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner (MMMC) mode. You must use the -delay_corner parameter instead.  "\fB-mean\fR" Controls nominal derating. You can apply separate derating the mean components of the delay.    "\fB-multiply\fR" Incrementally multiplies derates. You can also apply derates on specific leaf instances.  "\fB-net_delay\fR" Specifies scaling on net delays.  "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the list of instances, library cells, or nets to which the derating will be applied.  "\fB-power_domain <string>\fR" Allows you to specify a specific power domain for the timing derate factors to be applied.  "\fB-pulse_width_check\fR" Specifies derate values for pulse width checks.  Note: The -pulse_width_check and -clock_period_check parameters are mutually exclusive.  To apply check derating to pulse width checks, set the timing_enable_derating_for_pulsewidth_checks global variable to true. By default, the global is set to false.  "\fB-retain_delay \fR" Specifies scaling on retain constructs. If you specify both -retain_delay and -cell_delay parameters, the software uses the retain_delay value for retain construct scaling. If you do not specify the -retain_delay parameter, retain constructs are scaled in the same manner as cell delays.  "\fB-rise\fR" Applies the derating factor to rising delay and check arcs based on the transition direction at the arc's sink pin.  This parameter can be used to selectively apply timing derates for the rise arcs (cell, net, or check arcs).  "\fB-sigma\fR" Controls derating on the variation component. You can apply separate derating to the sigma components of the delay.   "\fB-static\fR" Applies the specified derating factor to the non-delta portion of net delays only.  You can specify -net_delay or -cell_delay parameter with the -static parameter.  You cannot specify -static with -mean or -sigma parameters.  "\fB-statistical\fR" Applies derating on cells or nets that are modeled as statistical data elements. The specified derating factor is applied to both the mean and sigma of delays.  If both set_timing_derate -corner and -statistical options are not specified, the derating factor is applied on variation and corner objects equally. This is equivalent to issuing to two separate set_timing_derate commands, one with -statistical option and the other with -corner option.  "\fB-transition\fR" Specifies scaling on transitions. When specified, the software allows derate transition and stretch waveforms.
