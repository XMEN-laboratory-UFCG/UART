.SH Name \fBverifyWireGap\fR \-  Verifies the continuity of follow pin and stripes
.SH Syntax \fBverifyWireGap\fR  [-help]   [-append]   [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]   [-layers <layer_names>]  [-net <power_nets>]   [-report <filename>]   [-wireToBoundary [-chip {<v1 v2>}] [-core {<v1 v2>}] [-block {<v1 v2>}] [-powerdomain {<v1> <v2>}]]   [-wireToShape [-ring <value>]]  [-wireToWire <value>]  
.P Verifies the continuity of follow pin and stripes. Use this command to identify power strap failures due to broken power wires in the power planning stage. The verifyWireGap command gives you the flexibility to check for breaks in a specific area and for specific layers or power nets.
.P Additionally, you can use this command to ensure that wires do not stop short of the expected distance from the chip, core, or block boundary.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyWireGap parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man verifyWireGap   "\fB-append\fR" Specifies that all previous verifyWireGap settings will be kept.  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the area to be checked.   "\fB-block {<v1 v2>}\fR" Specifies the wire-to-block gap distance. Here:
.RS  "*" 2  v1: Specifies the threshold value or acceptable distance from the block boundary to the wire.  "*" 2  v2: Specifies how far to look from the block boundary to find wires that should be considered for the check.
.RE   Use this check to ensure that vertical straps cover the horizontal straps underneath them near a block edge. For example, if you specify verifyWireGap -wireToBounday -block {0 0.3}, any wire that is at a distance less than 0.3um from the block boundary is reported as a violation. Wires that are at a greater distance than 0.3um are not flagged as violations as such breaks are assumed to be intentional.  "\fB-chip {<v1 v2>}\fR" Specifies the wire-to-chip boundary gap distance. Here:
.RS  "*" 2  v1: Specifies the threshold value or acceptable distance from the chip boundary to the wire.  "*" 2  v2: Specifies how far to look from the chip boundary to find wires that should be considered for the check.
.RE   For example, if you specify verifyWireGap -wireToBounday -chip {0 0.3}, any wire that is at a distance less than 0.3um from the chip boundary is reported as a violation. Wires that are at a greater distance than 0.3um are not flagged as violations as such breaks are assumed to be intentional.  "\fB-core {<v1 v2>}\fR" Specifies the wire-to-core boundary gap distance. Here:
.RS  "*" 2  v1: Specifies the threshold value or acceptable distance from the core boundary to the wire.  "*" 2  v2: Specifies how far to look from the core boundary to find wires that should be considered for the check.
.RE   For example, if you specify verifyWireGap -wireToBounday -core {0 0.3}, any wire that is at a distance less than 0.3um from the core boundary is reported as a violation. Wires that are at a greater distance than 0.3um are not flagged as violations as such breaks are assumed to be intentional.  "\fB-layers <layer_names>\fR" Specifies the metal layers to be considered.   "\fB-net <power_nets>\fR" Specifies the name of the power nets that will be checked.   "\fB-powerdomain {<v1 v2>}\fR" Specifies the wire-to-power-domain gap distance. Here:
.RS  "*" 2  v1: Specifies the threshold value or acceptable distance from the power domain to the wire.  "*" 2  v2: Specifies how far to look from the power domain to find wires that should be considered for the check.
.RE   "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the report file for verifyWireGap violations data.  "\fB-ring <value>\fR" Specifies the wire-to-ring gap distance.   "\fB-wireToBoundary\fR" Checks the wire to boundary gap. You must specify one of the following sub-options with -wireToBoundary:
.RS  "*" 2 -block to check the gap between wire and block boundary.  "*" 2 -chip to check the gap between wire and chip boundary.  "*" 2 -core to check the gap between wire and core boundary.  "*" 2 -powerdomain to check the gap between wire and power domain.
.RE   "\fB-wireToShape\fR" Checks the gap between the wire and some specific shapes.   "\fB-wireToWire <value>\fR" Specifies the wire-to-wire gap distance. Use this check to ensure that wires do not stop short of another wire of the same net or layer. For instance, you can use this check to ensure that wires connect properly to a power ring.  If the wire-to-wire gap in the same net is less than the specified threshold value, verifyWireGap flags it as a violation. If the wire-to-wire is greater than the threshold value, the break is assumed to be intentional.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.SH Example
.P The following command checks wire-to-wire gap and flags wires in the same net that are closer than 0.2um:
.P verifyWireGap -wireToWire 0.2
