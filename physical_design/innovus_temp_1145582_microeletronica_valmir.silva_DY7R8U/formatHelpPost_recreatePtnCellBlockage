.SH Name \fBrecreatePtnCellBlockage\fR \-  Recreates cell blockage for a specified partition, or all partitions
.SH Syntax \fBrecreatePtnCellBlockage\fR  [-help]  [<ptnName>]  [-noPinCutSpace | -hasPinCutSpace]  [-noViaCutSpace | -hasViaCutSpace]  
.P Recreates cell blockage for a specified partition, or all partitions. This reflects incremental changes, such as pin movement. You can use this command after editing the pin in a partition with the Pin Editor, or using the editPin command, to move pins in the partition. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each recreatePtnCellBlockage parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man recreatePtnCellBlockage  "\fB<ptnName>\fR" Specifies the partition to recreate the cell blockage.  Default: All partitions  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-noPinCutSpace\fR" Specifies that no cut space will be created for pins in the partition cell blockage.  Note: Blockages are always cut for power pins.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-hasPinCutSpace\fR" Specifies that cut space will be created for pins in the partition cell blockage.  Note: This is the default.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noViaCutSpace\fR" Specifies that no cut space will be created for vias in the partition cell blockage.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-hasViaCutSpace\fR" Specifies that cut space will be created for vias in the partition cell blockage.  Note: This is the default.  Data_type: bool, optional
