.SH Name \fBdefOutBySection\fR \-  Writes information to the specified sections in a DEF file
.SH Syntax \fBdefOutBySection\fR  [-help]   <filename>  [-addHalfWireExtensionOnPin]   [-bumpAsPin]   [-compPlacement]  [-earlyGlobalRoute]   [-fills]  [-groups [-noPrintGroupRegex]]  [-ioRow]  [-netRouting]  [-noComps]    [-noCoreCells]  [-noDieArea]  [-nonDefaultRules]   [-noNets]  [-noPrintWildCard]  [-no_virtual_trim]  [-outputMaskLayers <layerNames>]  [-pBlockages]    [-pins]   [-rBlockages]  [-rows]  [-scanChains]   [-selected]   [-specialNetRouting]   [-specialNets]  [-specialRouteUserClass <user_class_list>]  [-specialShape <swire_type_list>]   [-tracks]  [-unit unit_per_micron]   [-unplaced]  [-usedVia]   [-verilog_from_def_netlist_flow]   [-vias]
.P Writes information to the specified sections in a DEF file.  By default, it writes DIEAREA (and associated FE_CORE_BOX* properties), and the netlist part (not the placement or routing part) of the COMPONENTS and NETS sections that must be explicitly suppressed with options below if you don't want them. Other sections or sub-sections are only added based on option settings.
.P By default, the defOutBySection command does not write out any via defined in the LEF file. If the defOutLefVias global environment variable is set to 1, the defOutBySection command writes out the via defined in LEF file.
.P You can use the defOutBySection command after importing a design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each defOutBySection parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man defOutBySection  "\fB-addHalfWireExtensionOnPin\fR" Forces the zero-extension on pins to the default half-width extension.   "\fB-bumpAsPin\fR" Writes bump cells as top-level pins in the PINS section. Use this parameter to generate a DEF file for use with Quantus gate-level extraction.  Important: A DEF file generated with this parameter cannot be read back into the Innovus software.  "\fB-compPlacement\fR" Writes component placement and orientation information to the COMPONENTS section of the DEF file. The output is limited to instances with PLACED/FIXED/COVER status, unless -unplaced is also specified.  "\fB-earlyGlobalRoute\fR" Writes wire information generated by the Early Global Router to the NETS section of the DEF file.   "\fB<filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the DEF output file.  "\fB-fills\fR" Writes metal fill information to the FILLS section of the DEF file.  "\fB-groups\fR" Writes group information to the GROUPS section of the DEF file. When you use this parameter, Innovus also writes information about regions.  "\fB-ioRow\fR" Generates I/O rows based on I/O pad placement and writes the I/O row information to the DEF file.  "\fB-netRouting\fR" Writes routing data to the NETS section of the DEF file.  "\fB-noComps\fR" Excludes component information from the DEF file.  "\fB-noCoreCells\fR" Excludes core cell information from the DEF file to reduce the data size for import into APD.   "\fB-noDieArea\fR" Excludes the DIEAREA and associated FE_CORE_BOX* properties (FE_CORE_BOX_LL_X, FE_CORE_BOX_UR_X, FE_CORE_BOX_LL_Y, FE_CORE_BOX_UR_Y). You can use this option if you do not need some sections, such as SCANCHAINS or NONDEFAULTRULES, to be consistent with the DIEAREA or core-box settings.   "\fB-nonDefaultRules\fR" Writes non default rules (NDRs) to the NONDEFAULTRULES section of the DEF file.  Note: The -nonDefaultRules parameter works only with -noNets. As the NETS section is always dumped by default, so the NONDEFAULTRULE section is also dumped by default. However, if -noNets is specified, the NONDEFAULTRULE section will be dumped only if -nonDefaultRules is also specified.  "\fB-noNets\fR" Excludes net information from the DEF file.  Note: If -noNets is specified, the -netRouting and -earlyGlobalRoute parameters are ignored.  "\fB-noPrintGroupRegex\fR" Suppresses the use of regular expressions to represent instance names. You must also specify the -groups parameter.  "\fB-noPrintWildCard\fR" Suppresses the use of the wildcard format to represent special net connectivity. If specified, the -compPlacement parameter is ignored.  Note: The -noPrintWildCard parameter must be used along with the -specialNets parameter to be effective. If you specify -noPrintWildCard without -specialNets, the software ignores it.    Default: If you do not specify this parameter, Innovus writes connectivity information in the SPECIALNETS section in wildcard format, if possible.  "\fB-no_virtual_trim\fR" Excludes the trim metal shapes on a virtual trim metal layer.   "\fB-outputMaskLayers <layerNames>\fR" Outputs MASK data on specified layers only.   "\fB-pins\fR" Writes pin information to the PINS section of the DEF file.  "\fB-pBlockages\fR" Writes placement blockage information to the BLOCKAGES section of the DEF file.  "\fB-rBlockages\fR" Writes routing blockage information to the BLOCKAGES section of the DEF file.  "\fB-rows\fR" Writes row information to the ROWS section of the DEF file.  "\fB-scanChains\fR" Writes scan chain information to the SCANCHAINS section of the DEF file.  "\fB-selected\fR" Writes out information for selected as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 If a net or instance is selected, writes only the DEF header and COMPONENT section for instances or nets you have selected in the Innovus main window. If you specify the -specialNetRouting parameter along with this parameter, the defOutBySection command writes selected nets with their special routing to the NETS section of the DEF file.  "*" 2 If a net is not selected but individual segments or vias are selected, writes only the selected vias to the DEF file. All LEF vias are excluded by default. If the defOutLefVia global variable is set to 1, defOutBySection -selected includes selected LEF vias when writing out selected vias.  "*" 2 If a bump is selected, writes bump pin connection to the SPECIALNETS section of the DEF file. If a net is selected but bump pins are not individually selected, bump pin connection is not written.  "*" 2 If a blockage is selected in the main window, writes blockage information to the DEF file.  "*" 2 If a group is selected, all the instances in the selected groups are treated as selected and are writtten out.
.RE   "\fB-specialNets\fR" Writes the pin connections for special nets to the SPECIALNETS section of the DEF file. When specified along with -selected, writes out the pin connections for only selected nets.  Does not write routing information.  "\fB-specialNetRouting\fR" Writes routing information for special nets to the SPECIALNETS section of the DEF file, when specified with the -specialNets parameter.  Writes only the routes, without the pin connectivity information, to the SPECIALNETS section when specified without the -specialNets parameter.  Use this parameter with -selected to write routing information of only selected nets.  Use this parameter with -specialRouteUserClass to write routing information of only those special routes that have a user_class attribute from the specified list.  "\fB-specialRouteUserClass <user_class_list>\fR" Writes out only the special routes with a user_class attribute from the specified list.  "\fB-specialShape <swire_type_list>\fR" Writes special routing information with specified shape types.  Note: Use defOutBySection -specialShape after you have used the setSpecialRouteType command to mark special wires and vias and set them to a specific shape type.  "\fB-tracks\fR" Writes routing track information to the TRACKS and GCELLGRID statements of the DEF file.  "\fB-unit unit_per_micron\fR" Defines the units for the DEF file.  "\fB-unplaced\fR" Includes UNPLACED instances in the COMPONENTS section when combined with the -compPlacement option.  "\fB-usedVia\fR" Specifies that only used vias should be written to the DEF file. Unused vias are ignored. All LEF vias are also excluded by default. To include used LEF vias in the DEF file, set the defOutLefVias global variable is set to 1 before specifying defOutBySection -usedVia.
.RS  "*" 2 If you specify both -usedVia and -selected, the -usedVia option is ignored and only selected vias are written to the DEF file. The following warning message is issued:
.RE   **WARN: (ENCDF-1039): Option -usedVia will be ignored because option -selected is specified. Only selected vias will be output.
.RS  "*" 2 If neither -selected nor -usedVia is specified and the defOutLefVias variable is set to 0 (default), all DEF vias are written out.  "*" 2 If neither -selected nor -usedVia is specified and the defOutLefVias variable is set to 1, all DEF and LEF vias are written out.
.RE   "\fB-verilog_from_def_netlist_flow\fR" Reconciles the names in the DEF and Verilog files generated by the loadDefFile command. The loadDefFile command generates a flat Verilog file in which all of the special characters are escaped. Use this parameter to convert the escaped names back to the original names in the DEF file.   "\fB-vias\fR" Writes via information to the VIAS section of the DEF file. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command writes component placement, pin, and special net information to the test.def file:   defOutBySection -compPlacement -pins -specialNets test.def
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 In the following set of commands, setSpecialRouteType first traces special wires and vias that touch the named bump cells and sets them to IOWIRE. defOutBySection then writes the special routing with IOWIRE shape type to the test1.def file.   setSpecialRouteType -bumpCell {bc*} -stopTypeList {IOWIRE} -setType IOWIRE   defOutBySection -specialShape {IOWIRE} test1.def  "*" 2 With only the VDD net selected in the main window, the following command writes the routing information without pin connections for only those special routes in VDD that have the user_class attribute names attrA or attrB.  defOutBySection -specialNetRouting -specialRouteUserClass {attrA attrB} -selected
