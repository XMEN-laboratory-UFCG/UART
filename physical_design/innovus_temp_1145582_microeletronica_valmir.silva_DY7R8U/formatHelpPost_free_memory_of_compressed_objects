.SH Name \fBfree_memory_of_compressed_objects\fR \-  Releases all the excess memory used by dbGet
.SH Syntax \fBfree_memory_of_compressed_objects\fR  [-help]
.P Releases all the excess memory used by dbGet. When the dbGet command is used to query sWire or sVia under the compressed PG mode, it causes increased memory usage. This is because fake objects are created rapidly, but those cannot be released automatically. The free_memory_of_compressed_objects command is used to release such fake objects and to free such occupied memory for the user. Hence, the command reduces memory consumption caused by dbGet in the compressed PG mode.
.P Note: The object pointer released through this command becomes invalid and cannot be queried. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each free_memory_of_compressed_objects parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man free_memory_of_compressed_objects
