.SH Name \fBgenerate_tech_pg_lib\fR \-  Generates the technology power-grid library on the fly
.SH Syntax  \fBgenerate_tech_pg_lib\fR  [-help]  [-decap_cells <cell_list>]  [-default_power_voltage <value>]  [-esd_cells <cell_list>]  [-filler_cells <cell_list>]  [-keep {true | false}]  [-lef_layermap <filename>]  [-output_dir <dir_name>]  [-power_gate_file <filename>]  -tech_file filename  [-tech_only {true | false}]
.P Generates the technology power-grid library on the fly. The generated tech-PGV will be deleted after the session is over. If this command is specified, the Power Analysis and Rail Analysis engines will automatically use the on the fly generated tech-PGV. The purpose of generating the tech-only PGV on the fly is that you do not need to keep a track of the tech-only PGVs. Thus, it ensures that the tech-only PGV is generated from the correct Quantus technology file.
.P The tech-only PGV library will be generated under the working directory and will be called by Power/Rail Analysis on the fly, as shown in the following log file snippet:

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help \fR" Outputs the command usage.   "\fB-decap_cells <cell_list>\fR" Specifies the names of cells that have explicit decoupling capacitance for use in decap optimization. These cells are nearly equivalent to feedthrough cells, except that there is typically an active device between the power and ground nets to provide extra decoupling capacitance. Power-grid view library generation uses this list of cells to ensure that a capacitance value is associated with each cell. If no capacitance is associated with a cell, a warning message will be issued.  "\fB-default_power_voltage <value>\fR" Specifies voltage for the power pins which are present in LEF.  The default  value is 1.2.    "\fB-esd_cells <cell_list>\fR" Specifies a list of Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) cells. You can use this parameter to characterize ESD cells.  "\fB-filler_cells <cell_list>\fR" List the names of the filler or feedthrough cells that have no GDS data. These cells can be swapped out for decaps during decap optimization.   "\fB-keep {true | false}\fR" Specifies that the generated library should be retained after the session completes.  The default value is false.   "\fB-lef_layermap <filename>\fR" Specifies a file that provides the mapping of layers between the LEF and technology file. This parameter is optional. Library Generation automatically generates the layermap file using the technology LEF (containing all layer and via definitions) and Quantus Tech (extraction library) files, therefore, a LEF layermap file is not a mandatory input. The automatically generated layermap file is located in the PGV temp directory.  The following is the format and sample content of the auto-generated file (lefdefLayerMap_AutoGenerated.txt):  Layer Type   tech_layername   lefdef    lefdef_layername  via              VIA_9        lefdef      VIA9  metal            METAL_1      lefdef      METAL1  You can specify this parameter if you want to provide your own layermap file.  "\fB-output_dir <dir_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the output directory in which tech-only power-grid library is created. The default is the current working directory.  "\fB-power_gate_file <filename>\fR" Specifies a file with the information that technology library generation needs to characterize a powergate cell. Specifies the cell name, unswitched power pin, switched power pin, on resistance in ohms, saturation current in milliamps, and leakage current in milliamps. The format of the file is:  <cell> <supply> <switched> <Ron> <Idsat> <Ileak>  The following is an example of multiple footer powergate:  FOOTBUFVHSV16 VSSG VSS 63 3.167 0.000128252   FOOTBUFVHSV32 VSSG VSS 63 3.167 0.000128252   FOOTBUFVHSV64 VSSG VSS 63 3.167 0.000128252   FOOTBUFVHSV8 VSSG VSS 63 3.167 0.000128252  "\fB-tech_file <filename>\fR" Mandatory parameter. Specifies the name of the technology file that will be used for extraction.   "\fB-tech_only {true | false}\fR" Specifies to generate the technology PGV without any cells. The default value is false.
