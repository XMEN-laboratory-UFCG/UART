.SH Name \fBverifyIO2BumpConnectivity\fR \-  Verifies multiBump multiPad connectivity
.SH Syntax \fBverifyIO2BumpConnectivity\fR  [-help]   [-error <integer>]   [-report <string>]   [-subclass <string>]   [-warning <integer>]   [-bump_connect_target | -class_bump ]   [-bumps <string> | -class_bump ]   [-bumps <string> | -nets <string>]
.P Verifies multiBump multiPad connectivity. The flip chip flow in Innovus supports multiple pads to multiple bumps connections. Use the verifyIO2BumpConnectivity command, instead of verifyConnectivity to verify such connections.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyIO2BumpConnectivity parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man verifyIO2BumpConnectivity  "\fB-bump_connect_target\fR" Checks only whether or not the routing matches the connection specified by bump_connect_target properties ( io:pin:port) regardless of the class of the port.   "\fB-bumps <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the bumps that are to be checked.   "\fB-class_bump\fR" Checks only whether or not the ports of CLASS BUMP are routed to the bumps regardless of the  bump_connect_target properties.    "\fB-error <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of errors to report.  "\fB-nets <string>\fR" Specifies the names of the nets that are to be checked.   "\fB-report <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the report file in which verifyIO2BumpConnectivity violation data is recorded.  Default: designname.io2bump.rpt  "\fB-subclass <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the subclasses of which the wires and vias are to be checked.   "\fB-warning <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of warnings to report.
