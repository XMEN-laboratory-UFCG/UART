.SH Name \fBtiming_timing_window_pessimism_removal_include_si_delay\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_timing_window_pessimism_removal_include_si_delay\fR {true | false}  
.P Default: false
.P Controls inclusion of SI delay in timing window pessimism removal between the attacker and victim pins in the design.
.P The cross-talk analysis of a net depends on the relative positioning of attacker and victim arrival times. To compute the worst case switching times, the arrival windows of attacker and victim are considered. If the attacker and victim share a common clock path, then considering the original arrival windows will be pessimistic, and the common path contribution in these arrival windows needs to be adjusted.   When set to false, the software adjusts the elongated timing windows with the difference in the minimum-maximum base delay of the common clock path at the top level - while calculating the closest switching time, and the SI incremental delay differences are not adjusted.  When set to true, the software adjusts the timing windows with the SI incremental delay differences as well, in addition to the base delay. When this global variable is enabled, the timing window calculation can be optimistic, especially for cases where the attacker and victim are triggered by different clock edges. But for cases where all the attacker and victim nets are triggered by the same clock edge, then real pessimism will be removed from the timing window calculation.
.P Note: The timing_timing_window_pessimism_removal_include_si_delay global variable applies only when timing_enable_timing_window_pessimism_removal is set to true.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
