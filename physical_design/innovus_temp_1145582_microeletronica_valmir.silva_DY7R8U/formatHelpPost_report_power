.P Reports global power, specific instance power, clock network power, clock domain power, and net switching power. The command also reports the power for power domains and specific power nets. The power unit used throughout the reports is Milliwatt.
.P This command starts the execution of power analysis (both static and dynamic). The report_power command has a character limit of 1015.    Note: The parameters of the report_power command, except -cap, -clock_gating_efficiency, -register_gating_efficiency, and -cluster_gating_efficiency, are not supported in the dynamic-only mode (set_power_analysis_mode -disable_static true). These parameters are only supported in the static mode. However, the -power_domain parameter is not supported even if the static power mode is enabled.  The set_power_include_file command can be used to pass the report_power command options in the dynamic analysis mode.
.P The report_power command allows generation of multiple power reports with a single report_power command. It can be used to generate all the static reports during dynamic analysis. report_power eliminates the need to run incremental report_power in static power analysis using a Verilog netlist. By default, a detailed power summary report, and a short summary will be printed at the beginning of all reports. To enable this flow, specify the following parameters:
.RS  "*" 2 -output/o  "*" 2 -report_prefix
.RE
.P The following report_power command parameters are supported by the multi-report flow, both in static and dynamic power analysis:
.RS  "*" 2 -cell  "*" 2 -clock_gating_efficiency  "*" 2 -register_gating_efficiency  "*" 2 -cluster_gating_efficiency  "*" 2 -net  "*" 2 -instances  "*" 2 -pg_net  "*" 2 -clock_network  "*" 2 -hierarchy
.RE
.P The following parameters are not supported in the multi-report flow:
.RS  "*" 2 -cell_type  "*" 2 -power_domain  "*" 2 -clock_domain  "*" 2 -clock_gating_efficiency and -clock_network in the same run
.RE   Note: In the static power analysis flow, you can run the report_power command after the restore_power_database command without loading the design. The following command is an example of the use model:  restore_power_database -file power.db  report_power -output same -report_prefix report -clock_network {all} -instances {*}The following parameters of the report_power command are supported without design loading:
.RS  "*" 2 -cell  "*" 2 -cell_type  "*" 2 -instances  "*" 2 -clock_network  "*" 2 -clock_domain  "*" 2 -pg_net  "*" 2 -pg_net -format detailed  "*" 2 -hierarchy  "*" 2 -hierarchical_instances

"\fB-comb_seq_power\fR" Generates a report that shows the ratio of combinational versus sequential power for all modules of a given hierarchy. This parameter must be specified with the -instances parameter.   "\fB-compress <compression_ratio>\fR" Specifies to compress the power analysis report files in the GNU Zip format. The compressed files will have the suffix
.gz.  <compression_ratio> is from 0-9. 0 indicates that the report files are not to be compressed. The compression levels vary from 1 to 9. 1 provides the fastest compression speed but at a lower ratio, so the file size will be larger. 9 provides the highest compression ratio but at a lower speed.  Default: 0  "\fB-count_seq_elements_in_clock_network\fR" Includes the leaf flip-flop power in the clock network power report.

The detailed format includes additional information, such as output pin capacitance (Cpin Sum), output net capacitance (Cnet Sum), Total Load Capacitance (Cpin Sum + Cnet Sum = Total Load_Cap), maximum frequency at the input and output pins (Max_Clk_Freq), maximum activity factor at the input and output pins (Max_Activity), cell name of the instance (Cell Name), clock or data cell (C/D), and library used in power analysis for the specific cell (Lib). The libraries are numbered in the header section.
.RE   The name of the generated report file is report.*.detailed.rpt. Currently, the -format detailed parameter is only available when it is used with the -pg_net parameter.  "\fB-hierarchical_instances {<hierarchy_inst_list>}\fR" Specifies to report all the power content for the specified hierarchical instances/ blocks. It reports the Total Power (a breakup of power components) and Group (a breakup of power by cell type) of the specified block at each hierarchy.  To generate a complete hierarchical instance power report, it is recommended to specify -hierarchical_instances with -report_prefix. The report is written in the specified output directory. If you specify -outfile instead of -report_prefix, an instance file is output without hierarchy-level details.  -report_prefix generates the following 3 reports:
.RS  "*" 2 <<prefix>>.rpt - reports power details for all instances in the design.  "*" 2 <<prefix>>.hierpwr.rpt - reports hierarchical power, that is, power summary, internal, switching, leakage, and total power for all hierarchical instances.  "*" 2 <<prefix>>.hierinstpwr.rpt - reports power details for the requested block instances.
.RE   Note: -hierarchical_instances must be specified with -hierarchy to include hierarchy-level power report. When -hierarchical_instances is used without -hierarchy, only top-level summary of the power consumption is written.  "\fB-hierarchy {all | <hierarchy_level>}\fR" Specifies the hierarchy level that is included in the power report. You can specify the <hierarchy_level> as a number that corresponds to a specific hierarchy level in the design. A <hierarchy_level> of 0 specifies the top level.  Default: all  "\fB-instances {instance_list}\fR" Specifies the instances to include in the power report. The power report provides the amount of power consumed by a specified list of hierarchical or leaf-level instances. <instance_list> accepts wildcards (*) for leaf-level instances only. An instance with 0 power will not be listed in the power report.  "\fB-inst_list_file<filename>\fR" Specifies a file containing a list of instances that are to be included in the power reports.   "\fB-leakage\fR" Reports leakage power of the design.  "\fB-net\fR" Reports the net switching power, load capacitance, toggle rate, and switching values for each net in the design.  "\fB-no_wrap\fR" Displays the report_power -cell_type all output on a single line in the output report file.  "\fB-nworst<number_of_nets>\fR" Limits the reporting to the specified number of nets having the highest switching power.  Note: The -nworst parameter must be specified with the -net parameter.  "\fB-output/-o <directory>\fR" Specifies the name of the directory where the power analysis reports are saved. The default is the current working directory. This parameter eliminates the need to specify set_power_output_dir. However, if both  report_power -output and  set_power_output_dir are specified,  -output has higher priority.   "\fB-outfile <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the report file to which the power consumption information is written. Hierarchical directory names can be included.  You can convert a power report file to the gzip file format by specifying -outfile <filename.gz>.  Note: If you do not specify this parameter, the software directs the power report to the command line, as well as the log file, and no power report is written to a separate file.  "\fB-pg_net {all | <pg_net_name_list>}\fR" When set to all, the amount of power consumed by all power nets is reported. If a list of nets is specified, the power consumption of each instance that is connected to the specified power net is separately reported.  Note: When using this parameter, the static power calculation engine always performs propagation and power calculation.  Default: all  "\fB-pg_pin\fR" Reports power consumed by all power pins in a design.  "\fB-power_db_directory <directory>\fR" Specifies the location of the power database that the Power Calculation engine uses for generating standalone power reports.   "\fB-power_domain {all | {<power_domain_list>}<}>\fR" When set to all, the power consumed by all power domains is reported. If a list of power domains is specified, the reporting will be limited to those power domains. A summary of power break-down for each domain, before listing power for each instance in the domain, is also generated.  "\fB-power_density_tiles <value>\fR" Specifies the number of tiles used for power density calculation.  Default: 100  "\fB-power_density_tiles_row_col {<value1> <value2>}\fR" Defines the number of tiles by rows * columns.  value1 is the number of tile rows and value2 is the number of tile columns.  The following example specifies to perform power density aware vector profiling using 2 tile rows and 2 column rows:  set_power_analysis_mode -method vector_profile -vector_profile_mode power_density -worst_step_size 10ns  report_power  -power_density_tiles_row_col  {2 2} -time_based_report -outfile tiling1.rpt  The following is the vector profile report for this command:  Tile 0_0_0 5.06 5.33 14.95 14.555  Tile 1_0_1 14.95 5.33 24.84 14.555  Tile 2_1_0 5.06 14.555 14.95 23.78  Tile 3_1_1 14.95 14.555 24.84 23.78 
... 
...  "\fB-power_density_tiles_size {<value1> <value2>}\fR" Defines the absolute tile size. value1 is the horizontal width of a tile (in micron) and value2 is the vertical height of a tile (in micron).

"\fB-print_memory_power\fR" Specifies to report power values for the memory and macro cells under separate groups (Memory and Macro).  The following is a snapshot of the power report showing separate groups for memory and macro cells:(<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-group_type <user_defined_group_name>\fR" Specifies to report power (internal/switching/leakage/total) for a user-defined collection of cells that are stated under a power group in the power summary report. The following Tempus commands can be used to create power groups:
.RS  "*" 2 define_property - define a property.  "*" 2 set_property - assign the defined property (group type) and its value (power group) to a list of cells.
.RE   The use model of the -group_type parameter is:  report_power -group_type <user_defined_group_type>  Here, <user_defined_group_type> is the user-defined power group type applied to a list of cells in a design. When the -group_type parameter is specified, the command reports power for the power groups associated with the specified group type in the power summary report.  Example:  The following command defines the poly_bias property (group type) on library cells:  define_property poly_bias -object_type lib_cell -type string  The following commands apply the property poly_bias with the group name P0 and P10 to the collection of cells:  set_property [get_lib_cells -of_objects [get_cells -hier * -filter {ref_name=~*PB0*}]] poly_bias  P0  set_property [get_lib_cells -of_objects [get_cells -hier * -filter {ref_name=~*PB10*}]] poly_bias  P10  The following command reports power for the user-defined power groups that are associated with the propertypoly_bias:  report_power -outfile basic_group_type.rpt -group_type poly_bias  The following is a snippet of the power report that shows the user-defined power groups P0 and P10 that are associated with the property poly_bias, in addition to the existing groups (sequential, macro, IO, and so on):  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-register_gating_efficiency\fR" Generates a report that includes the Register Gating Efficiency (RGE) and Data Aware Gating Efficiency (DAGE) for all sequential cell instances, as well as different hierarchies in the design. Average RGE and DAGE for different hierarchies is reported. It also displays a section on ICG cluster information, that is, information about registers at the fan-out of each ICG instance along with their RGE metrics.  Register Gating Efficiency is calculated as:  RGE = 1 - (toggles at register clock pin/root clock toggles)  When an RGE report is generated using the report_power -register_gating_efficiency -outfile rge.rpt command, the following information will be included:
.RS  "*" 2 Register-gating Efficiency Report - for each clock domain, it includes the toggle rate, number of registers, number of clock gates, average clock toggle at registers, average toggle savings at registers, and average toggle savings histogram.   "*" 2 Register Gating Opportunities Report - this report is sorted based on the Q/CLK toggle ratio. When a register's Q/CLK ratio is greater than
.25 (25%), Q toggles every other clock cycle. However, when it is less than 25%, there is a gating opportunity to reduce power.
.RE   Data Aware Gating Efficiency is calculated as:  DAGE = 1 - ((toggles at clock pin - 2*toggles at Q pin)/(root clock toggles))  "\fB-report_prefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies a prefix for the report in which the top-level summary of the power consumption information is written. All reports will be named <prefix>.*.rpt. The detailed summary will be named prefix.rpt.

.RE   The thermal conductivity file format is:  Section 1 (layer type based thermal conductivity value)   #default  $layer_type1 $thermal_conductivity_parameter1  $layer_type2 $thermal_conductivity_parameter2 
...  Section 2 (layer name based thermal conductivity value)  #perlayer  $layer1_name $thermal_conductivity_parameter1 $dielectric_thermal_conductivity_1  $layer2_name $thermal_conductivity_parameter2 $dielectric_thermal_conductivity_2 
...  Here,
.RS  "*" 2 You can either specify both Section 1 (layer type based) and Section 2 (layer name based), or specify one of the two sections. If both sections are specified, then layer name based section takes precedence over layer type based section.  "*" 2 The layer name based section has thermal conductivity value and its dielectric layer's thermal conductivity value for each metal/via layer.  "*" 2 If section 2 has no parameters defined, the software will use the default parameters defined in the section 1.
.RE   Example:  ###default  Metal      430  Silicon    250  Dielectric 0.6  ###Perlayer  Metal1    430    0.4      Via1      410    0.5      Metal2    390    0.5      Via2      410    0.5

The layer thickness value for the power map generation flow can either be a user-specified value or derived from the technology file. If both the values are available, the user-specified value takes precedence.   "\fB-thermal_power_map_bottom_layer <layer_name>\fR" Writes zero metal density tables for layers lower than the user-specified layer in the power map file. This parameter prevents duplication of metal density tables when merging the top and block thermal power map files.

This parameter prevents duplication of metal density tables when merging the top and block thermal power map files.   "\fB-thermal_power_map_SI_unit {true | false}\fR" Specifies to change chip thermal power map units to SI in the thermal power map file. This parameter was introduced to support the thermal power map file format used by foundry.  When this parameter is set to true, the values for all the power map parameters (length, power, and thermal conductivity) will be reported in the SI units.

If multiple clocks are reaching the instance, then the fastest clock is used as a reference.   "\fB-use_geometry_cell_size {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to use the actual geometry or placement bounding box for macro PGV cell size during generation of tile-based power map file. This parameter is used when a macro's power is distributed across multiple tiles. When this parameter is set to true, the geometry-based bounding box will be used for power map generation and power will be distributed evenly across tiles.  Default : false  "\fB-view <view_name>\fR" Specifies the active timing view that was created using the multi-mode multi-corner (MMMC) set_analysis_view -setup|-hold command. Power analysis is performed for the specified view. The command prints the MMMC view name in the output file even if you do not specify the -view parameter.  If report_power -view <view_name> is set, it will override the view set in the set_power_analysis_mode -view command. However, if you specify the set_analysis_view -dynamic and -leakage parameters, then the view set using these set_analysis_view command parameters has higher priority over the report_power -view command.  Default : Uses current view in Innovus.
