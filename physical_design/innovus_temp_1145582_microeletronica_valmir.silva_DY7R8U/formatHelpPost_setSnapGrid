.SH Name \fBsetSnapGrid\fR \-  Creates a global snapping grid for wiring (including metal fill shapes and via cuts)
.SH Syntax \fBsetSnapGrid\fR  [-help]   -layer {<layer_list>}  [-pitch <x> <y>] 
.P Creates a global snapping grid for wiring (including metal fill shapes and via cuts). The grid defines the snap pitch, which is finer than the LEF PITCH for the specified layer. The grid is a multiple of the manufacturing grid. You can specify pitch value to check/set routing/metal fill segment's corner edges on the snap grid.
.P When you specify this command, the wires, metal fill shapes, and via cuts are snapped to this grid, and the edges of the shapes (for example, wires and vias) lie on the manufacturing grid. The verify_drc command can check that the shapes are on-grid.    Note: The snap grid is not saved in the Innovus database. To use the snap grid, you must run this command each time you load a design.
.P Verify geometry, power planning and routing, metal fill, and wire editing share the grid setting. Before running commands related to these areas, use setSnapGrid to define the grid as additional constraints.
.P For more information, see the commands addMetalFill, addViaFill, or verify_drc. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setSnapGrid parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man setSnapGrid  "\fB-layer {<layer_list>}\fR" Specifies the layers for the snap grid. You can specify metal layers as METAL1, METAL2, and so on, and cut layers as VIA12, VIA23, and so on.  "\fB-pitch <x y>\fR" Specifies the pitch for the snap grid. The LEF PITCH must be a multiple (for example, 2x, 4x, 8x) of the snap grid for the specified layer. For example, if the LEF PITCH is 0.2 , you can specify a snap grid pitch for both x and y of 0.1
. 
.SH Example
.P The following commands set snap grid settings that are used while verifying geometry:
.P setSnapGrid -layer {1 2 V12 V23} -pitch 0.02 0.02
