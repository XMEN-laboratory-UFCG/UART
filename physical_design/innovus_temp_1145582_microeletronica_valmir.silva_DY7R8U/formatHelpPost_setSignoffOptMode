.P Applies non-default settings for signoffTimeDesign and signoffOptDesign super commands. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each   setSignoffOptMode parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters,   use the man command:   man setSignoffOptMode  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified options to default value. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setSignoffOptMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset , the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-addInst {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether Setup/Hold/DRV optimizer is allowed to add buffer/delay/swap cell instances.  Default: true  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-addLoad {true|false}\fR" Specifies whether Hold optimizer is allowed to add dummy cell instances.  Default : false   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-allowSkewing {true | false}\fR" Allows clock skewing to be done during Setup timing optimization to further improve Setup slack. When set to true, signoffOptDesign -setup works on the last level of the clock tree to modify the clock skew in order to improve Setup timing closure. Modification on the clock tree can be either resizing of the last level of the clock tree or buffering to pad endpoint clock pin.  Default: false  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "*" 2 When -allowSkewing is active, signoffOptDesign will automatically unfix all clock tree instances/nets but it does not honor any CCOpt property that is set using the set_ccopt_property command. This is also performed when implementing the ECOs.  "*" 2 As for data path optimization, skewing is not allowed to create new Hold violated paths.
.RE   Example:  The following commands perform clock skewing during setup fixing. Only CKBUFX1 and CKBUFX4 can be added to the clock tree.  setSignoffOptMode -clockCellList {CKBUFX1 CKBUFX4}  setSignoffOptMode -allowSkewing true  signoffOptDesign -setup  "\fB-alongRouteBuffering {true | false} \fR" When set to true, the software uses node location provided through the parasitic data in order to insert buffers along the routing topology not only at the start or end of the net. This helps to better balance the slew or the load for long nets, which is typically needed for setup timing optimization or DRV fixing.  Default: false  Note:
.RS  "*" 2  A prerequisite of this parameter is that parasitic with the node location is provided to signoffOptDesign. In addition, the node location parasitic should be read using the -starN parameter. For example: spefIn -starN.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.
.RE   "\fB-bufferCellList <cell_list>\fR" Specifies a list of buffer/delay cells that can be used for the timing optimizer, regardless of  whether those cells have a dontUse attribute.   When the list is empty, the software will automatically identify the list of usable buffer/delay cells.  Default: " "  (empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-checkDrvFromHoldViews {true | false}\fR" Enables optimization of DRV violations (max_capacitance/max_transition) in hold views as well in setup views during DRV optimization. Also, when enabled, this parameter ensures that timing/area/power optimization will not create any new DRV violation in hold and setup views.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign and signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-checkType {early | late | both}\fR" Specifies the type of ECO Timing DB to be generated in PBA mode. The early argument specifies hold ECO Timing DB and late specifies setup ECO Timing DB. When set to both, the ECO Timing DB generation will be done in PBA for both Setup and Hold timing.  Default: both   Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only active when the -retime option is being set.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.
.RE   "\fB-clockCellList <cell_list>\fR" Restricts the list of buffers that are allowed to be used by ECO on the clock tree.  Default:  (empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.   "\fB-clockMaxLevel <INT>\fR" Specifies the maximum levels in clock skewing thus limiting the amount of clock tree levels and avoiding the creation of an unbalanced clock tree. This parameter sets an upper boundary when adding a buffer or pair of inverters to the clock nets. The software counts the number of levels in the clock tree branch that is being modified to ensure that the maximum level will be equal to or less than the value set by this parameter.  Default: 0  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-deleteInst {true | false}\fR" Enables buffer deletion when doing timing, power, or area reduction. This option is not honored by the -leakage parameter of signoffOptDesign since it performs only swapping.   Default: true  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-disableGeometryChecks {true | false}\fR" Performs Vth swapping without checking the pins and geometry of a design. You can relax/stop/avoid the geometry checks during Vth swapping so that the tool just checks the cell size while performing Vth swapping. This will lead to more Vth swaps. The counterpart to this is that ecoRouting will be needed once the ECOs are applied since pin geometries might always match between old and new cells.  Default : false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-drvMargin <float> \fR" Specifies the ratio by which DRV check would be relaxed or tightened. It scales the maximum capacitance and maximum transition constraints according to the margin decimal value specified. For example, specifying a value of 0.2 for this parameter tightens the margin (makes it more pessimistic) by 20 percent during optimization and specifying a value of -0.2 relaxes the margin (makes it more optimistic) by 20 percent.  This margin is honored for DRV optimization.  Note: The software only accepts values from -0.7 to +0.7. A positive value indicates tighter constraints.  Default: 0   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-ecoFilePrefix <string>\fR" Specifies the prefix name for the ECO files generated.  Default: " "  (empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-emType {all | avg | rms | peak}\fR" Specifies the current waveform calculation method when doing EM fixing.  Default: all  "\fB-fixCellEm {true | false}\fR" When set to true, fixes the cell-level signal electromigration violations during DRV fixing using resizing and additional transforming techniques.  Default: false  Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign -drv.  "*" 2 If set during DRV fixing, the software will fix only the cell EM violations. This means that fixing of max_transition/max_capacitance/SI glitch/SI Xtalk/IR drop will be disabled.
.RE   "\fB-fixClockDrv {true | false}\fR" Fixes maxCap/maxTran violations on the clock networks. This is performed only when the signoffOptDesign -drv command is run.  Default: false  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 For clock network DRV fixing, only the cells listed in the clock cell list (specified using the setSignoffOptMode -clockCellList parameter), is used. The DRV fixing is not performed if a cell list is not provided.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.
.RE   "\fB-fixDataDrv {true | false}\fR" Fixes maxCap/maxTran violations on data nets. This is performed only when the signoffOptDesign -drv command is run.  Default: true  "\fB-fixGlitch {true | false}\fR" Performs SI glitch fixing during DRV fixing using resizing and buffering techniques.  Default : false   Notes:
.RS  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.  "*" 2 The glitch fixing is done before max_tran/max_cap fixing.
.RE   "\fB-fixHoldAllowSetupOptimization {true | false}\fR" When set to true, incremental Setup fixing is performed during Hold fixing in order to create more Setup margins on Hold violated nodes   that could not be fixed earlier due to Setup timing conflict.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-fixHoldAllowSetupTnsDegrade {true | false}\fR" When active, the Setup Total Negative Slack can be degraded during Hold time violations fixing while still maintaining the Setup Worst Negative Slack in every Setup active views.   Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-fixHoldWithMargin <float> \fR" Specifies a slack margin value in nanoseconds for Hold time violations fixing. The purpose is to overfix any Hold violations by the amount of the margin value.   This margin is not applied on nets that are already meeting the Hold target slack.     Default: 0    Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-fixIrDrop {true|false}  \fR" Fixes the IR drop voltages for all instances in the design.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-fixMaxCap {true | false}\fR" Specifies that nets with max_cap violations should be fixed.  Default: true  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-fixMaxTran {true | false}\fR" Specifies that nets with max_tran violations should be fixed.  Default: true  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-fixOsusGlitch {true | false}\fR" When set to true, fixes nets with overshoot and undershoot glitches during DRV optimization.  Default: false  "\fB-fixSlackInRangeLowerLimit <value_in_ns>\fR" Sets the lower slack limit for a violated path to be considered during timing closure. The value is specified in ns.  Default: -1.00000001504747e+30  "\fB-fixSlackInRangeUpperLimit <value_in_ns>\fR" Sets the upper slack limit for a violated path to be considered during timing closure.The value is specified in ns.  Default: 1.00000001504747e+30  "\fB-fixSiSlew {true | false}\fR" Reports SI slews violations and fixed during DRV optimization. This is run as the first step of optimization before proceeding for any other incremental optimization.  When this parameter is set to true, it automatically sets the value of the -fixMaxTran parameter to true.  Default : false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign and signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-fixXtalk {true | false}\fR" Reduces the crosstalk on nets that have xtalk delta delays greater than the specified threshold value.  Default : false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign and signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-holdTargetSlack <float> \fR" Specifies a target slack value in nanoseconds for hold timing optimize.  Default: 0    Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-holdXtalkDeltaThreshold <value_in_ns>\fR" Fixes the nets with the crosstalk delta delay value equal to or greater than the specified threshold value for hold views. The threshold value is specified in ns.  Default: 0.3 ns  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-holdXtalkSlackThreshold <value_in_ns>\fR" Fixes nets with the slack threshold value equal to or less than a specified threshold value for hold views. The threshold value is specified in ns.  Default: 1000 ns  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-ignoreDrvChecks {true | false}\fR" Specifies that DRV checks should be ignored in setup/hold/area/leakage/dynamic optimization.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-keepTempfiles {true | false}\fR" Keeps all the temporary files generated by the distributed multi-mode multi-corner (DMMMC) and Tempus clients for debugging purposes.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-legalOnly {true | false}\fR" Enables the tool to use the physical data to search for legal location while doing any buffer insertion or instance movement. This ensures that there is no instance overlap at the end of the ECO fixing stage, and after sourcing the ECO file in the implementation tool, you can directly run ECO routing.    When this parameter is set to false, signoffOptDesign will not check for legal location although physical data is provided. In this mode, signoffOptDesign behaves in a Logical mode flow, which means that physical data will be ignored and this might create an instance overlap and will not check local density while inserting buffers. So it is recommended that you first run ECO fixing in the legal-only mode (which is the default mode) and then, depending on the requirement, you may perform an incremental run by setting -legalOnly to false.  Default: true   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-loadCellList <cell_list>\fR" Specifies the list of load cells to be inserted during Hold fixing, regardless of whether those cells have a dontUse attribute.  Default: ""(empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.   "\fB-loadEcoOptDb <dir_name>\fR" Specifies the path of the directory where previously generated ECO Timing DB files are kept. If not specified, the ECO Timing DB files will be generated.  Default: " "  (empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-loadIrdropDb<dir_name>\fR" Specifies the path of directory where previously generated IR drop database files are stored.  Default=" "  (empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-maxCapMargin <cap_margin_value>\fR" Specifies the ratio by which the max_cap check should be relaxed or tightened.  Default: 0  Minimum value: -10.000000  Maximum value: 0.990000  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-maxOptRunTime <INT>\fR" Specifies the time out period for only the timing/power optimization phase after which signoffOptDesign will exit the session.  Default=0  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-maxPaths <INT>\fR" Specifies the worst path found for each endpoint up to the number specified by the -maxPaths parameter during ECO Timing DB generation. By default, the tool will automatically set a value for -maxPaths that would lead to good PBA coverage of the design within reasonable run time. You can overwrite this by setting a specific -maxPaths value, but it is recommended to keep it larger than 1 million. In any case, you must ensure that -maxPaths value is superior or equal than the -nworst value multiplied by the number of GBA violated endpoints.  Default: -1  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only active when the -retime parameter is set.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.
.RE   "\fB-maxRunTime <INT>\fR" Specifies the time out period, in minutes, after which signoffOptDesign will exit the session.  Default: 0  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-maxSlack <float> \fR" Specifies the maximum slack value to be used during ECO Timing DB generation when using PBA. Setting a positive -maxSlack value forces the software to retime positive GBA slack paths so that ECO optimization engine can benefit from an extra PBA Setup slack credit when doing Hold fixing or Power recovery. A positive -maxSlack value implies larger runtime during ECO Timing DB generation, but the software will retime only as many paths as what is specified through the -maxPaths parameter.  Default: 0  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only active when the -retime parameter is set.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.
.RE   "\fB-maxTranMargin <tran_margin_value>\fR" Specifies the ratio by which the max_tran check should be relaxed or tightened.  Default: 0  Minimum value: -10.000000  Maximum value: 0.990000  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-numReportPaths <INT>\fR" Specifies the number of paths printed after signoff timing analysis per view.  Default: 50   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.  "\fB-nworst <INT>\fR" Specifies the nworst control for path-based analysis.  Default: -1  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only active when the -retime parameter is set.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.
.RE   "\fB-optimizeCoreOnly {true | false}\fR" Performs only reg2reg optimization, when set to true.  Default: false   Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is not applicable for DRV optimization.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.
.RE   "\fB-optimizeReplicatedModules {true | false}\fR" Allows the software to perform timing optimization inside replicated hierarchies   while generating only one ECO file per sets of clones.   The cell name of the replicated hierarchies have to be listed in a file pointed by the -partitionListFile option.  Default: false    Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-optimizeSequentialCells {true | false}  \fR" Allows the software to perform timing optimization for sequential cells.  Default: true  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-partitionListFile <string>  \fR" Specifies the file containing list of partitions in the design.  Default=" " (empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-pbaEffort {medium | high}\fR" When high effort mode is specified, all the optimization engines perform more aggressive timing closure or area/power recovery with  respect to path-based (PBA) timing and the expectation is to get better quality of results.  In some cases, when large amount of ECOs are done in this mode, the final timing signoff might show some setup timing degradation, which can be recovered by running a second ECO loop doing only setup timing recovery with the -setupRecovery parameter set to true.  Default: medium  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign and signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-pbaEcoRoute {true|false}\fR" When set to true, enables ecoRoute to use accurate path-based analysis (PBA) timing during the ECO signoff timing/power closure flow. This parameter should be specified at the start of the signoffOptDesign/signoffTimeDesign flow.  Default: false  "\fB-postMask {true | false}\fR" Enables the timing closure engine to perform the following netlist changes without touching the base layer mask:
.RS  "*" 2 Inserts the Gate Array buffers or an inverter pair in place of existing Gate Array filler cells.  "*" 2 Resizes regular cells to Gate Array cells. It also resizes Gate Array cells to Gate Array cells.  "*" 2 Deletes a regular cell.
.RE   The software automatically identifies the Gate Array cells by checking which library instances have the same SITE name as the Gate Array filler cells specified by the user. Here, empty spaces are filled up by the Gate Array filler cells to ensure 100% placement density.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This is supported by DRV, Setup, and Hold fixing.  "*" 2 When setTieHiLoMode -cell {{<tieLo_name tieHi_name>}} setting is used, the Metal ECO flow will insert the TieLo cells to connect dangling input pins, in case the existing TieLo cells in the floorplan are extremely far or too overloaded.
.RE   Example:  The following command enables Hold fixing in the metal ECO mode by allowing the listed Gate Array filler cells to be deleted or inserted during the ECO process.  setSignoffOptMode -postMask true  setSignoffOptMode -useGaFillerList {GFILL1BWP GFILL2BWP GFILL4BWP GFILL10BWP}  signoffOptDesign -hold  Default: false  "\fB-postStaTcl <FILE> \fR" Specifies the file containing the TCL code that will be executed immediately after signoff timing analysis per view.  Default: " "  (empty string)  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 These TCL codes should follow Tempus syntax.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.
.RE   "\fB-powerAware {true | false}\fR" Enables power awareness in all optimizers and transforms.  Tempus ECO provides the ability to take power as part of the overall cost function when doing timing closure.  When this parameter is enabled before the start of an optimization session, the current optimization and any subsequent optimizations (if running in incremental mode) checks for power changes for all optimizers and transforms during any changes in the design. In any case, the first priority remains getting the best final timing but enabling this option will get there with possibly slighter ECO although resulting in lesser final power.  For example, during to fix a Setup timing path violation, by default the tool would potentially choose to size one instance to a high leakage cell, while with -powerAware mode, the tool would try to get to same timing by doing multiple sizing to non-high leakage cells.  Note
.RS  "*" 2 This feature requires power activity to be annotated on the netlist with report_power command, either through external activity file (recommended) or using propagated activity based on some default toggling rate.  "*" 2 This feature honors the -powerOptFocus option, which means that the user can decide to force the tool in reducing more total or leakage or dynamic power increase.
.RE   Default: false  "\fB-powerOptFocus total | leakage | dynamic | leakageOnly | dynamicOnly\fR" Specifies whether a given netlist should be optimized only for leakage or dynamic power reduction, or more for leakage or dynamic power while still reducing the overall total power during total power optimization.  The following options are available:
.RS  "*" 2  total: The power optimization engine focuses on getting the optimal total power in the design.  "*" 2  leakage: The power optimization engine optimizes total power but focuses more on leakage power reduction than on dynamic power reduction.  "*" 2  dynamic: The power optimization engine optimizes total power but focuses more on dynamic power reduction than on leakage power reduction.  "*" 2 leakageOnly: The power optimization engine focuses only on leakage power reduction.  "*" 2 dynamicOnly: The power optimization engine focuses only on dynamic power reduction.
.RE   Default: total   Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is honored by signoffOptDesign -power and also by signoffOptDesign -drv/-setup/-hold when the -powerAware parameter is set to true.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  
.RE   "\fB-prefixName <string>\fR" Specifies the prefix to be assigned to the new instances inserted.  Default:  ESO   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-preserveFiller {true | false}\fR" When set to true, saves and restores filler states during signoff timing optimization. This helps improve the runtime as it saves the time taken to re-insert all the fillers.  Default: true  "\fB-preStaTcl <FILE>\fR" Specifies a file containing the TCL code that will be executed immediately prior to signoff timing analysis per view.  Default: " "  (empty string)  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 These TCL codes should follow Tempus syntax.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.
.RE   "\fB-resizeInst {true | false}\fR" Enables/disables resizing transform.  Default: true   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-retime {none | aocv | path_slew_propagation | aocv_path_slew_propagation}\fR" Selects the retime mode for path-based analysis.  Default: none   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign and signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-retimeDepth {default | infinite}\fR" Retimes depth for exhaustive path based analysis.  Default: default  "\fB-retimeDepthEarly {default | infinite}\fR" Retimes depth for exhaustive path based early analysis.  Default: default  "\fB-retimeMode {none | path | exhaustive}\fR" Retimes mode for path based analysis.  Default: path  "\fB-routingCongestionAware {true | false} \fR" Checks routing congestion before doing any netlist change.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-saveEcoOptDb <dir_name> \fR" Specifies a path of directory where generated database files are kept.  Default: ecoTimingDB   Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffTimeDesign.  "\fB-selectHoldEndpoints <file_name>\fR" Specifies a file containing the list of selected endpoints for hold fixing.  Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 When including endpoints, the -optimizeCoreOnly option must be set to false.  "*" 2 This parameter is set during ECO optimization.  
.RE   Default: " "  (empty string)  For details about the file syntax, see Path Group Support in Timing Optimization in the Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-selectDrvNetFile <file_name>\fR" Specifies a file containing the list of nets to be optimized during DRV fixing. The fixing of max_transition and max_capacitance violations occurs only on the specified nets and the other violating nets are ignored. The file specified includes one net per line.

"\fB-selectDrvPinFile <file_name>\fR" Specifies a file containing the list of instance pins to be optimized during DRV fixing. The fixing occurs only on the specified instance pins and the other violating pins are ignored. The file specified includes one pin per line.  Note: Wild cards and regular expressions are not supported in this file.  Default= " " (empty string)  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-selectSetupEndpoints <file_name>\fR" Specifies a file containing the list of selected endpoints for setup fixing.  Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 When including endpoints, the -optimizeCoreOnly option must be set to false.  "*" 2 If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign. 
.RE   Default: " "  (empty string)  For details about the file syntax, see Path Group Support in Timing Optimization in the Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-setupRecovery {true | false}\fR" Specifies power-aware setup recovery for setup fixing.  Default: false  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-setupTargetSlack float \fR" Specifies a target slack value in nanoseconds for setup timing optimization.  Default: 0  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-setupXtalkDeltaThreshold <value_in_ns>\fR" Fixes the nets that have a crosstalk delta delay value equal to or greater than a specified threshold value for setup views. The threshold value is specified in ns.  Default: 0.3 ns  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-setupXtalkSlackThreshold <value_in_ns>\fR" Fixes the nets with the slack threshold value equal to or less than a specified threshold value for setup views. The threshold value is specified in ns.  Default: 1000 ns  Note: If set, this parameter must be applied before signoffOptDesign.  "\fB-skipDrvNetfile <file_name>\fR" Specifies a file containing the list of nets to be excluded during DRV fixing.
