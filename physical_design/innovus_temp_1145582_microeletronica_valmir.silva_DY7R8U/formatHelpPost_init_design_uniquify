.SH Name \fBinit_design_uniquify\fR
.SH Syntax \fBinit_design_uniquify\fR <value>  
.P Type: Integer

.P Specifies whether the top is uniquified. When set to 1 (true), the design is uniquified during the read and flatten process. Optimization is not allowed on a non-unique design. For use in a master/clone partitioning flow, the value should be 0 (false). The init_design_uniquify global variable replaces the previous rda_Input(ui_uniquify_netlist) configuration file variable. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies that the design should be uniquified automatically after the top cell is flattened.   set init_design_uniquify {1}
