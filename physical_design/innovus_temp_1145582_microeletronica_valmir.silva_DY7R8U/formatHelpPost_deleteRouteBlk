.SH Name \fBdeleteRouteBlk\fR \-  Deletes a routing blockage object. Use this command during partition floorplanning
.SH Syntax \fBdeleteRouteBlk\fR   [-help]  [-box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>} | -name <blk> | -all ]  [-layer <layerName> | {<layerNameList>} | all]   [-cutLayer <layerName> | {<layerNameList>} | all]  [-drcRegionLayer <layerName> | {<layerNameList>} | all]  [-trimMetalLayer layerName | {layerNameList} | all]   [-type {all | routes | fills | slots | partial}]  
.P Deletes a routing blockage object. Use this command during partition floorplanning.
.P Note: The deleteRouteBlk command matches the layer name and the layer type while deleting routing blockages. If the layer name and the layer type do not match, the specified layer is not deleted and a warning about the mismatch is displayed. This rule is honored by standard layers, cutLayers, drcRegionLayers, and trimMetalLayers. When a list of layers is specified, only the layers matching with the specified layer type are deleted. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-all\fR" Removes all route blockage objects in the floorplan.  Data_type: bool, required  "\fB-box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the bounding box of the blockage area.  Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-cutLayer <layerName> | {<layerNameList>} | all\fR" Specifies the cut layer, list of cut layers, or all cut layers on which the routing blockage is to be deleted.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, it deletes the routing blockage object on all cut layers.  Data_type: list, optional  "\fB-drcRegionLayer <layerName> | {<layerNameList>} | all\fR" Specifies the drc region layer, list of drc region layers, or all drc region layers on which the routing blockage is to be deleted.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, it deletes the routing blockage object on all drc region layers.  Data_type: list, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each deleteRouteBlk parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man deleteRouteBlk  "\fB-layer <layerName> | {<layerNameList>} | all\fR" Specifies the layer, list of layers, or all layers on which the routing blockage is to be deleted.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, it deletes the routing blockage object on all layers.  Data_type: list, optional  "\fB-name <blk>\fR" Specifies the name of the route blockage. You can specify wild cards as part of the route blockage name.  Data_type: list, required  "\fB-trimMetalLayer <layerName> <>| {<layerNameList>} | all\fR" Specifies the trim metal layer, list of trim metal layers, or all trim metal layers  on which the routing blockage is to be deleted.  Data_type: list, optional   "\fB-type {all | routes | fills | slots | partial}\fR" Specifies the type of routing blockage to delete. The following options are available:
.RS  "*" 2 all: Deletes all types of blockages.  "*" 2 routes: Deletes the blockages that block routing.  "*" 2 fills: Deletes the blockages that block metal-fill.  "*" 2 slots: Deletes the blockages that block slots.   "*" 2 partial: Deletes partial routing blockages.
.RE   Default: all  Data_type: enum, optional
