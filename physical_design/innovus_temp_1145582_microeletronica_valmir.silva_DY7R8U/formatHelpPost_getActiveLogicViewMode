.SH Name \fBgetActiveLogicViewMode\fR \-  Controls certain behaviors of active logic view commands
.SH Syntax \fBgetActiveLogicViewMode\fR  [-help]  [-keepAsync {false | true}]  [-keepHighFanoutPorts {true| false}]  [-keepInstInSdc {true|false}]  [-keepLoopBack {false | true}]  [-quiet]  [-nonDefault] 
.P Controls certain behaviors of active logic view commands.
.P Use the getActiveLogicViewMode command to display the current settings for the setActiveLogicViewModecommand. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-keepAsync {false | true}\fR" Discards or retains the portion of the netlist relating to asynchronous control and scan controls terminals. By default, the tool discards this portion of the netlist. This option potentially conflicts the setting of setAnalysisMode -async true when the analysis for an asynchronous circuit is desired. When this happens, a warning message is issued.  Default: false  "\fB-keepHighFanoutPorts {true | false}\fR" Retains or discards the portion of the netlist relating to high-fanout ports. By default, the tool retains this portion of the netlist.  Default: true  "\fB-keepInstInSdc {true|false}\fR" Keeps instances which have constraints on it.  Default: false  "\fB-keepLoopBack {false | true}\fR" Discards or retains the portion of the netlist relating to input and output loopback paths. By default, the tool discards this portion of the netlist.  Default: false  "\fB-help \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each getActiveLogicViewMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man getActiveLogicViewMode  "\fB-nonDefault\fR" Displays the current settings which are not default settings.   "\fB-quiet\fR" Displays the current settings for the specified parameters in the Tcl list format.  If you specify -quiet without any parameters, the software displays the current settings of all the getActiveLogicViewMode parameters in the Tcl format. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command displays the current setting for the highFanoutPort parameter in the Tcl list format:   getActiveLogicViewMode -keepHighFanoutPorts -quiet  The software displays the following information:  true
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command displays the current setting for the getActiveLogicViewMode parameter:   getActiveLogicViewMode  The software displays the following information:  -keepAsync false                     #bool, default=false  -keepHighFanoutPorts true            #bool, default=true  -keepLoopBack false                 #bool, default=false  {keepAsync false}  {keepHighFanoutPorts true}   {keepLoopBack false}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command displays the current settings for all the getActiveLogicViewMode commands in the Tcl list format only:   getActiveLogicViewMode -quiet  The software displays the following information:  {keepAsync false} {keepHighFanoutPorts true} {keepLoopBack false}
