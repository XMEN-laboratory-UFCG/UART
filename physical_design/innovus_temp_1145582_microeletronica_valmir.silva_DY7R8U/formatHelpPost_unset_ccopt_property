.SH Name \fBunset_ccopt_property\fR \-  This command is used to reset the CCOpt object properties to their default values
.SH Syntax \fBunset_ccopt_property\fR   [-help]   name  [-cell <library_cell_name>]  [-clock_tree <clock_tree_name>]   [-clock_tree_source_group <source_group_name>]  [-delay_corner <delay_corner_name>]  [-flexible_htree <flexibleHtreeName>]   [-help <property_name>]   [-inst <instance_name>]   [-lib_pin <pin_name>]   [-net <net_name>]   [-net_type leaf | trunk | top]   [-pin pin_name]  [-power_domain <domain_name>]   [-skew_group <skew_group_name>]    [-early | -late]    [-rise | -fall]    [-min | -max] 
.P This command is used to reset the CCOpt object properties to their default values.
.P The -help parameter of the command when used with the property name is used to retrieve detailed help on the property (unset_ccopt_property <property_name> -help). For example, run the following command to view detailed help on the use_inverters property:
.P unset_ccopt_property use_inverters -help
.P The software displays the following information:
.P Specifies whether clock tree synthesis should prefer to use inverters rather   than buffers when balancing the clock tree. If set to true, CTS will use   inverters for the clock tree balancing process. If set to false, CTS will use   the minimum number of levels of inverters required to maintain logical   correctness. If set to auto (the default) CTS will use what it considers to be   the best combination of buffers and inverters to get optimal quality of   results.
.P Default: auto
.P Valid values: auto true false
.P Applies to: Global, clock_tree
.P Note: For detailed description of all public CCOpt properties, see the CCOpt Properties chapter in Innovus  User Guide.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help \fR" Outputs a brief description for the unset_ccopt_property command. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command: man unset_ccopt_property.  "\fB-cell <library_cell_name>\fR" Specifies the library cell to which the property applies.   "\fB-clock_tree <clock_tree_name>\fR" Specifies the clock tree to which the property applies.   "\fB  -clock_tree_source_group <source_group_name>\fR" Specifies the clock tree source group to which the property applies.   "\fB-delay_corner <delay_corner_name>  \fR" Specifies the delay corner to which the property applies.   "\fB-early\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the early signal.   "\fB-fall\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the fall signal.   "\fB-flexible_htree  <flexibleHtreeName>\fR" Specifies the flexible H-tree to which the property applies.   "\fB-help <property_name>\fR" Provides help for the specified property. All other options are ignored.   "\fB-inst <instance_name>\fR" Specifies the instance to which the property applies. This parameter enables properties to be added to instances.   "\fB-late\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the late signal.    "\fB-lib_pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the library pin to which the property applies.   "\fB-max\fR" Specifies the maximum value for the property.    "\fB-min\fR" Specifies the minimum value for the property.   "\fB<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the property to unset.   "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the net level to which the property applies.   "\fB-net_type <leaf | trunk | top>\fR" Specifies the net type to which the property applies. It could be leaf net, trunk net, or top net.   "\fB-pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the pin to which the property applies.   "\fB           -power_domain            <domain_name>\fR" Specifies the power domain to which the property applies.   "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the rise signal.   "\fB-skew_group <skew_group_name>\fR" Specifies the skew group to which the property applies.
