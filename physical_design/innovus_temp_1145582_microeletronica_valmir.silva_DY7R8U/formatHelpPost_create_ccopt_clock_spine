.SH Name \fBcreate_ccopt_clock_spine\fR \-  Creates a CCOpt spine object
.SH Syntax \fBcreate_ccopt_clock_spine\fR    [-help]    [-hard]    -name <spinename>   [-x <x>]    [-xmax <xmax>]    [-xmin <xmin>]    [-y <y>]    [-ymax <ymax>]    [-ymin <ymin>] 
.P Creates a CCOpt spine object. A spine is a single vertical or horizontal line under which clock instance pins that exist in the pre-cts netlist can be arranged. Spines must be either vertical with a single X value or horizontal with a single Y value. For example, to create a vertical spine, you need to specify a target X value, and a Y range. All distances are in microns. For example:
.P create_ccopt_clock_spine -name spineA -x 1000.0 -ymin 500.0 -ymax 1500.0
.P The software displays the following message:
.P Created clock spine: spineA  Note: Only those pins whose CCOpt property, lock_on_clock_spine, contains the name of the spine will be aligned to that spine. This property specifies a set of clock spine names restricting where the pin should be located. If the set contains more than one item, the pin may be placed on any of the specified clock spines. For more information about how this property is used, type the following:
.P get_ccopt_property -help lock_on_clock_spine
.P A spine may be specified as "hard", in which case it defines a rectangle, and cells will be moved out of this area, if possible, to make way for cells locked to the spine. For example:
.P create_ccopt_clock_spine -name spineB -hard -y 2000.0 -xmin 0.0 -xmax 3000.0 -ymin 1990.0 -ymax 2010.0
.P Note: When specifying a hard spine, the target X or Y value must lie between the specified edges.   Note: This command is a part of the CCOpt spine functionality, which is a limited-access feature in this release. It is enabled by a variable specified through the setLimitedAccessFeature command. To use this feature, contact your Cadence representative to explain your usage requirements, and make sure this feature meets your needs before deploying it widely.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_ccopt_clock_spine parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man create_ccopt_clock_spine.  "\fB-hard    \fR" If specified, creates a hard clock spine. This creates a rectangle and it causes other cells to be pushed out of the spine region bounds to make way for the cells locked to the spine.   "\fB-name\fR" Specifies the user-defined identifier for this clock spine. This parameter is required.  "\fB -x <x>\fR" Specifies the X value of a vertical clock spine's target line.  "\fB-xmax <xmax>\fR" Specifies the maximum X value of objects on a horizontal spine, and the right edge of the hard spine area.  "\fB-xmin <xmin>  \fR" Specifies the minimum X value of objects on a horizontal spine, and the left edge of the hard spine area.   "\fB  -y y   \fR" Specifies the Y value of a horizontal clock spine's target line.   "\fB-ymax <ymax>\fR" Specifies the maximum Y value of objects on a vertical spine, and the top edge of the hard spine area.   "\fB-ymin <ymin>  \fR" Specifies the minimum Y value of objects on a vertical spine, and the bottom edge of the hard spine area. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a hard, horizontal spine, with the specified target Y value, and the four edges of the rectangle to be cleared:  create_ccopt_clock_spine -name -hard spineB -y 2000.0 -xmin 0.0 -xmax 3000.0 -ymin 1500.0 -ymax 2500.0  The software displays the following message:  Created clock spine: spineB
