.P Attaches attributes to nets and subnets. Attaching the attributes allows the NanoRoute routing commands (globalRoute, detailRoute, globalDetailRoute, routeDesign, and setNanoRouteMode), and the earlyGlobalRouteearlyGlobalRoute command to route the nets following specific requirements. Attributes are persistent; that is, throughout the routing process, from global routing to optimization, the routers honor the attributes. The attributes are saved in the Innovus System database. If you save the database and exit, the attributes remain attached to the nets when you re import the database.
.P Note:  Attributes are not saved in the DEF file.
.P To see the current attribute settings, use the getAttribute command. If you attempt to run the setAttribute command on any net that is part of a diffPair, matchLength, or complex shield constraint group, or a simple or complex netClass, the command reports an error stating that the command cannot be run on nets with integration constraints.
.P Tip: To revert to the default value of an attribute, specify default for the attribute. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-avoid_detour {true | false}\fR" Avoids detours of roughly more than a few gcell grids on the specified nets. This attribute affects global routing only.  Note: Cadence recommends that you use caution with this attribute, as it adds congestion to the design.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-bottom_preferred_routing_layer <layer_number>  \fR" Specifies the preferred lowest routing layer. This attribute is a soft limit; that is, NanoRoute might use a layer below the specified layer if necessary to complete routing.  Range: 0-15  Note: Layers can only be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF layer names is not supported by this parameter.  Note:  If the top routing layer is equal to or greater than 4 and no bottom preferred routing layer is specified for clock nets, the router automatically sets the bottom preferred routing layer for clock nets to 3, to prevent the clock nets from blocking other nets.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-bottom_preferred_shielding_layer <layer_number>\fR" Specifies the preferred lowest shielding layer.  Note: Layers can only be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF layer names is not supported by this parameter.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-cell_pin <cell_name>:<pin_name>\fR" Specifies attributes for all the nets connected to pins of instances having the same master cells. You can use: or / as a delimiter when you specify the cell name and the corresponding pin name.  Note:  If the specified setAttribute commands conflict, then the last setting takes precedence over all the previous setAttribute settings.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-coaxial_shield_interval tracks_number | metal_layer_name:tracks_number
...\fR" Specifies the interval of crossties by routing track.  Range: 0-63  Default: 0. Every track could be used by crosstie.  For example, when -coaxial_shield_interval 2 is specified, two tracks between two crossties will be empty.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-coaxial_shield_limit <layer_number:layer_number>\fR" Specifies the bottom and top routing layer limits for coaxial shields.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-coaxial_shielded_layers <layer_number>:<layer_number>\fR" Specifies the bottom and top routing layer for coaxial shields.   Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-comp_pin <comp>:<pin_name> <list> \fR" Specifies attributes for all nets and sub-nets connected to pins of instances having the same component. You can specify a list of pins. You can use  :  or / as a delimiter when you specify the component names and the corresponding pin names.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-em_ndr_dist <double>\fR" Specifies the distance from source to sink where it is needed to be applied with the EM ndr rule  Default: 0   Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-em_ndr_rule <ruleName>\fR" Specifies the non-default rule name which is used for EM issue fixing.  Default: " " empty  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-em_width_rule <layer width:dist pairs>\fR" Specifies the table of layer width:distance pairs. The layer width pair denotes the width for any layer to be changed from default width for EM fixing in distance X from driver.  For example, Metal1 1.0:0.5, Metal2 2.0:1.0  Note: The -em_width_rule parameter must be used with the -em_ndr_dist parameter. It can not be used with the -em_ndr_rule parameter as only one parameter can specify the non default width to apply.   Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setAttribute parameter.For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setAttribute.   "\fB-inst_pin  <instance:pin_name><list>\fR" Specifies attributes for all nets and sub-nets connected to pins of the same instance. You can specify a list of pins. You can use  :  or / as a delimiter when you specify the pin names and the corresponding instance names.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-layer_mask <bottomLayerNum:topLayerNum>\fR" Specifies the layer range to which the mask constraint should be applied. For example, if you specify 3:4, it means that the constraint should be applied on layers, Metal3 and Metal4.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-mask <mask_number>\fR" Masks constraint setting for the net. Legal values are from 0 to the mask number for the layers. A value of 0 indicates that there is no mask constraint on the net. A non-zero value indicates that all wiring on the net should be created on the specified mask. Layers that do not support the specified value will be treated as unconstrained.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-max_fanout <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum fanout value for nets and subnets.   Specifying setAttribute -net <netname> -max_fanout <value> provides per net based max_fanout constraint/control for a net. 
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 If -max_fanout value of a net is 0, and the -pattern of the net is trunk, the NanoRoute router honors the value of getNanoRouteMode -routeTrunkWithClusterTargetSize as the max fanout.  "*" 2 If -max_fanout value of a net is larger than 0, and the -pattern of the net is trunk, the -max_fanuout value overrides the value of getNanoRouteMode -routeTrunkWithClusterTargetSize for the net.
.RE 
.RE   Default: 0  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-min_stack_layer <layer_number>\fR" Specifies the minimum stacking layer. It indicates that stacked vias should be added to the specified layer on output pin only. If a pin already has pre-defined custom stacked vias, and the uppermost layer of the vias is still below the specified layer, additional stack vias should be added to the specified layer. Then, regular routing would start from the specified layer of the stacked vias.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-multi_cut_via_effort {low|medium|high}\fR" Specifies the multi-cut via effort. The effort level can be low, medium, or high.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-ndr_si_length_limit {<layer:distance>list}\fR" Specifies the table of parallel run length on each layer. For example, Metal1 1.0, Metal2 2.0. It relaxes a hard NDR into a soft NDR whenever the parallel run length between the NDR wire and an other wire is smaller than the specified value  For example,  setNanoRouteMode -route_strict_honor_route_rule true  setAttribute -net {xgxs_tx_rdy_lane[1]} -ndr_si_length_limit {metal3:0.054}  Where, xgxs_tx_rdy_lane[1] is the net name, metal3:0.054 is the prl limit 0.054 in Metal3 layer.  This setting is for, if parallel run length is less than distance(0.054) in the layer(Metal3) for the specified net, no NDR spacing is needed for this net (wire segment).  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-net <netName>\fR" Specifies the net for which to set attributes. Do not enter more than one net name.
.RS  "*" 2 To specify more than one net, use * and ? wildcard characters.  "*" 2 To specify nondefault rule nets, use @RULE.  "*" 2 To specify clock nets, use @CLOCK. (To select clock nets use selectNet -allDefClock.)  "*" 2 To specify prerouted nets, use @PREROUTED.
.RE   Note: Remove an attribute from a net by specifying none. For example, to remove the - shield_net attribute from net_1, specify the following command:  setAttribute -net net_1 -shield_net none  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-non_default_rule <rule_name> \fR" Identifies the nondefault routing rule to use with the specified net. Use this attribute for critical nets, such as clock nets, that might need to have wider wires or wider spacing than other nets. The NanoRoute router treats nondefault rule spacing as a soft attribute; that is, when routing resources are available, it honors the nondefault rule. If the area is too congested, and resources are not available, the router might not honor nondefault spacing rules. You can override this behavior by specifying setNanoRouteMode -route_strict_honor_route_rule true. When you specify this parameter, the router uses the nondefault spacing rules.  You define nondefault routing rules in the NONDEFAULTRULE statement of the LEF file.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-non_default_rule_effort {auto|soft|hard|no_taper}\fR" Specifies the non-default rule effort to use with the specified net. You can set any one of the options:
.RS  "*" 2 auto: follows the HARDSPACING for the NDR in the LEF file.  "*" 2 hard: makes the NDR hard even if HARDSPACING is not set in the LEF file.  "*" 2 soft: makes the NDR soft even if HARDSPACING is set in the LEF file.  "*" 2 no_taper: follows the HARDSPACING for the NDR in the LEF file and does not allow tapering at all pins.
.RE   Default: auto  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-one_side_spacing <bottomLayerNum:topLayerNum>\fR" Specifies the layer range that the one_side_spacing constraint should be applied on. This constraint means that spacing is reserved on any one side. For example, 3:4 means that the constraint should be applied on layers, Metal3 and Metal4.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-pattern {steiner | trunk}\fR" Specifies the routing pattern. Select one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 steiner: Routes all pins with a single steiner tree.  "*" 2 trunk: Routes pins to the nearest special net of the same name. Creates multiple steiner trees and connects them to the trunk.  "*" 2 Data_type: string, optional
.RE   "\fB-preferred_extra_space  <integer> \fR" Specifies the preferred extra spacing for nets. Gives additional pitch spacing to the specified net. Use this attribute to give critical nets extra space to reduce coupling. Specify -preferred_extra_space 1 to give a net 1 extra pitch spacing, compared to other nets. This parameter creates a soft rule and, if the design is congested, might not give the extra space to the net.  Range: 0-3  Note:  If you specify this attribute, Early Global Route also gives additional space to the specified nets.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-preferred_routing_layer_effort {low | medium | high | hard}  \fR" Determines how flexible the NanoRoute router is when setting layer limits for routing specified nets. Use this attribute with the -top_preferred_routing_layer and -bottom_preferred_routing_layer attributes. Specify medium, high, or hard to make NanoRoute less flexible (that is, to make NanoRoute obey the preferred routing layer range more strictly). When set to hard, NanoRoute prevents the nets from going to the non-preferred routing layers by setting large costs.  Default: low (more flexible)  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-reset\fR" Currently you cannot reset all the attributes of a net. You can reset each  attribute of a net by using the -reset parameter with the attribute or you can use the default keyword for the value of each attribute.  For example:
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the weight attribute of the net (scan_in_1) to 3 and the mask attribute to 2:   setAttribute -net scan_in_1 -weight 3 -mask 2  "*" 2 The following command resets the weight attribute of the net:  setAttribute -net scan_in_1 -reset -weight -mask 2  "*" 2 The following command resets the mask attribute of the net:  setAttribute -net scan_in_1 -weight 3 -mask default
.RE   Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-shield_net <special_net_name>\fR" Specifies a special net to use as a shield for a critical or high-speed net. Typically, you route shielded nets before routing other nets. You can specify one or two shield nets, however, you cannot control which side is used by the special net that is routed on the same layer as the signal routing. The shield terminates near the pin. Shielding information is saved in the DEF file.  Note:  The router does not support shielding nets that are defined in the SPECIALNET section of the DEF file. This limitation extends to nets that are defined partly in the SPECIALNET section and partly in the regular NET section of the file, such as some clock nets. If you set the shielding attribute on these nets, the router automatically sets the - skip_routing attribute on them as well. As a result, the nets are not modified by the router and, if they are not completely routed already, the router does not try to finish the connections. The router does not delete the shielding wires.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-shield_side {one_side | two_sides}\fR" Specifies the number of sides to route shield.  Default: two_sides  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-si_post_route_fix {true | false}\fR" Repairs crosstalk violations on specified nets.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-skip_antenna_fix {true | false}\fR" Prevents the router from repairing violations on specified nets with process antenna violations. This attribute is useful on nets that will have antenna violations repaired at the next level of hierarchy.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-skip_routing {true | false}\fR" Prevents the NanoRoute router from routing or rerouting unrouted or partially routed nets. When you specify -skip_routing for a net, the router treats the net as if you had marked it + FIXED in the DEF file and it becomes an obstruction for other nets. If the net is partially routed, the router does not complete the routing.  Note: The value you specify for this attribute also applies to Early Global Route.  Note: To skip routing on prerouted nets, specify setAttribute  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-stack_distance <distance>\fR" Specifies the stacking distance in microns.   Default: 0  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-stripe_layer_range <minLayer>:<maxLayer>\fR" Specifies the layer range that accommodates different StripeLayerRanges for different nets and subnets. You need to specify the following values with this parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 maxLayer: Specifies the top-most floating stripe layer allowed for connection.  "*" 2  minLayer: Specifies the bottom-most floating stripe layer allowed for connection
.RE   For example, 3:4 means that the constraint should be applied on M3 and M4.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-sub_net <sub_net_name>\fR" Specifies the subnet for which to set attributes. This parameter is used with the -net parameter.  For example:  setAttribute -net <netName> -sub_net <sub_net_name>   Note: Cadence recommends you to use the dbSet command for changing the specified attribute value for a database object. The dbSet command takes an object or object list as a starting point, then uses a period to traverse to other related objects, or access attributes. Additional periods can be used to continue traversing the database schema.  For example, to specify the top preferred routing layer and bottom preferred routing layers attributes for a subnet,  you can use the following dbSet commands:  dbSet [dbGet [dbGet head.libcells.name $cell_name -p].pgTerms.name $pg_pin_name -p].topPreferredLayer [dbGet head.layers.num 3 -p]  dbSet [dbGet [dbGet head.libcells.name $cell_name -p].pgTerms.name $pg_pin_name -p].bottomPreferredLayer [dbGet head.layers.num 2 -p]  instead of using the setAttribute -sub_net command.  setAttribute -net VDD1 -sub_net VDD1_2 -inst_pin iA/FEAOB*:TVDD -top_preferred_routing_layer 3 -bottom_preferred_routing_layer 2  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-top_preferred_routing_layer <layer_number> \fR" Specifies the preferred highest layer for routing specified signal nets. This attribute is a soft limit; that is, NanoRoute might use a layer above the specified layer if necessary to complete routing. Use this attribute to improve timing by restricting the routing layers available for critical nets, while simultaneously routing other nets on all routing layers.  Range: 0-15  Note: Layers can only be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF layer names is not supported by this parameter.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-top_preferred_shielding_layer <layer_number>\fR" Specifies the preferred highest shielding layer.  Note: Layers can only be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF layer names is not supported by this parameter.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-weight <integer>\fR" Specifies a relative weight for the nets. This value is honored by placement and not by the router.  Default: 2  Data_type: string, optional
