.SH Name \fBsignoffTimeDesign\fR \-  Runs signoff timing analysis using extraction (Quantus) and Tempus in batch mode, and generates timing reports and ECO DB for each view
.SH Syntax \fBsignoffTimeDesign\fR  [-help]  [-noEcoDB]  [-noExpandedViews]  [-outDir <string>]  [-prefix <string>]  [-reportFullClockPath]   [-reportOnly] 
.P Runs signoff timing analysis using extraction (Quantus) and Tempus in batch mode, and generates timing reports and ECO DB for each view. The command prints out a timing summary table per view and all the views combined. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-noEcoDB\fR" Disables generation of ECO timing DB.   "\fB-noExpandedViews\fR" Disables printing of expanded timing per view.   "\fB-outDir <string>\fR" Specifies the directory to save reports.   "\fB-prefix <string>\fR" Specifies prefix for timing report file names.  "\fB-reportFullClockPath\fR" When this parameter is specified, the detailed timing report that is generated contains the full clock path.  "\fB-reportOnly\fR" Skips parasitic extraction and use the parasitics in memory.
