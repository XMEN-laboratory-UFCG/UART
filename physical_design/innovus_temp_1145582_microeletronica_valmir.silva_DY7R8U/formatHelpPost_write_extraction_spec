.TH write_extraction_spec  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBwrite_extraction_spec\fR \-  Creates the Quantus command file or the Common Command Language (CCL) file in the current working directory and saves the design data for running standalone Quantus
.SH Syntax \fBwrite_extraction_spec\fR  [-help]  [-no_design_data]  [-out_dir {dir_name}]  [-rc_corners {<list_of_rc_corners>}]     
.P Creates the Quantus command file or the Common Command Language (CCL) file in the current working directory and saves the design data for running standalone Quantus. The command may be specified with a directory path where technology library file, LEF list file (for DEF-based flow), and DEF or OA design will be stored. However, if no directory path is specified, then a directory will be created in the current directory. The name of the directory will be in the format:  tmp_qrc_pid_time.  You can also specify whether you want to save the design data or not by using the -no_design_data parameter. If it is specified, then no design data, such as DEF or OA design will be saved.
.P In addition, to generate a command file for the OA-based flow, ensure that the setExtractRCMode-useQrcOAInterface parameter is set to true.
.P Note: Run this command after loading the design, setting up the MMMC environment, and specifying the CCL layer map file, if required.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help               \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each write_extraction_spec parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man write_extraction_spec.    "\fB-no_design_data   \fR" When this parameter is specified, no design data, such as DEF or OA design will be saved. By default, the design data will be saved.  If this option is specified, then follow the steps listed below to run Quantus.
.RS  "*" 2 For DEF-based flow, provide the DEF file while invoking standalone Quantus.  "*" 2  For OA-based flow, the command file that is generated will assume an OA design in the following  directory:  <lib name>/<top level cell name>/for_qrc The value of <lib name> and <top level cell name> will be written into the command file that is generated. If you want to specify a different OA design path, modify the command file.
.RE   Note: It is recommended that you use this parameter if you already have the DEF or OA design saved.  "\fB-out_dir {dir_name}\fR" Specifies the location of the output directory in which the technology library file and associated data, and design data will be saved. If no path is specified, then a directory, tmp_qrc_pid_time will be created in the current directory by default.  "\fB-rc_corners {<list_of_rc_corners>}\fR" Specifies the list of RC corners for which the Quantus command file is created. By default, the command outputs all active RC corners.  If this parameter is specified, then only the specified corners are included in the Quantus command file.  For example,  Consider two RC corners, RC1 and RC2, of which only RC1 is active.
.RS  "*" 2 If this parameter is not specified, then the command will generate a CCL file with one active corner, RC1.  "*" 2 If this parameter is specified with a non-active corner, RC2, then the command will create a CCL file for the specified corner.   write_extraction_spec -rc_corners RC2
.RE   Default: all active corners
