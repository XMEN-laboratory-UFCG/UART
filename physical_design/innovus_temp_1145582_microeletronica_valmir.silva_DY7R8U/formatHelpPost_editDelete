.P Deletes physical wires, any vias connected to the wires, and violation markers associated with the wires. Use editDelete -physical_pin_only to delete physical pins in the design.
.P By default, when you delete a wire or via with editDelete, the tool searches and deletes all related DRC markers. If you do not want the related DRC markers to be cleared when you delete a wire or via, set the setEditMode -drc_on parameter to false before using editDelete. This can improve the run time if have to delete a large number of wires and vias.
.P By default, the editDelete command retains TSVs and deletes only the real routing layers and vias. You can change this behavior by setting the  setEditMode -delete_tsv parameter to true before using editDelete.
.P Note: The editDelete command deletes only those vias that are connected to wires. To delete vias that are not connected to wires, use the deleteMetalFill command.
.P The editDelete command deletes physical wires. The deleteNet command deletes logical nets. For more information, see deleteNet. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editDelete parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man editDelete  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates for the area from which to delete the wires.  Default: Deletes all wires.  "\fB-direction {H | V | 45 | 135}\fR" Specifies the orientation of the wires to delete.   Default: If you do not specify this parameter, deletes wires with either orientations.  H: Specifies that only horizontal wires are to be deleted.  V: Specifies that only vertical wires are to be deleted.  45: Specifies that 45-degree wires are to be deleted.  135: Specifies that 135-degree wires are to be deleted.  "\fB-floating_via\fR" Specifies that only floating vias should be deleted.  "\fB-layer {<list_of_layers>}\fR" Specifies the layers from which to delete wires. You must use LEF layer names or a routing layer index value (1 for the first routing layer, 2 for the second routing layer, and so on). This option supports backside and Through Silicon Via (TSV) layers as well.  If you are specifying multiple layers, enclose them in braces.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, deletes wires from all layers.  "\fB-net <net>*\fR" Specifies the net or list of nets from which to delete wires. You can use wildcard values in this field. For example, if you specify V*, deletes wires from nets VDD and VSS. If you are specifying multiple nets, enclose them in braces.  Note: By default, the wires and vias shielding the nets specified with editDelete -net are not deleted. If you want to delete the shielding as well, specify -shield along with -net.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-object_type {Wire Via}\fR" Specifies whether wires or vias should be deleted. You can specify both as well.  If -object_type is not specified, editDelete deletes both wires and vias by default.  "\fB-parallel_routing\fR" Specifies that the wires created by NanoRoute parallel routing are to be deleted.   "\fB-physical_pin_only\fR" Specifies that the physical pins in the design are to be deleted. You can use filter options, such as -net, -layer, -area, and -selected along with -physical_pin_only to delete specific physical pins.  "\fB-regular_wire_with_drc\fR" Deletes the regular wires with violation markers. This parameter works only when -net or -status are specified as filters.  Note: editDelete -selected parameter deletes only physically selected objects. To delete wires with violations from a specific net, specify the net name with the editDelete -net parameter:  editDelete -net <netName> -regular_wire_with_drc  "\fB-selected\fR" Deletes selected wires, vias, and physical pins.  Note: Only physically selected objects are deleted. If selectNet is used to select a net, editDelete -selected cannot be used to delete that net's wires. This is because selectNet selects the net only logically. If you want to delete the entire net, use editSelect -net instead of selectNet to ensure the wires of the net are physically selected.  "\fB-shape {{RING STRIPE FOLLOWPIN IOWIRE COREWIRE BLOCKWIRE PADRING BLOCKRING FILLWIRE FILLWIREOPC DRCFILL None}}\fR" Specifies the shapes of the wires to delete. The status must be in all upper-case letters. If you specify multiple shapes, enclose the shapes in braces. For shape definitions, see Shapes, in the "DEF Syntax" chapter of the LEF/DEF Language Reference.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, deletes wires of all shapes.  "\fB-shield\fR" Deletes the wires and vias of the nets specified with the -net parameter, along with the wires and vias shielding the specified nets.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note: This parameter cannot be used with -shield_only.  "\fB-shield_only\fR" Deletes only the wires and vias shielding the nets specified with the -net parameter. The signal nets being shielded are retained.   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note: This parameter cannot be used with -shield.   "\fB-status {FIXED NOSHIELD ROUTED SHIELD UNKNOWN}\fR" Specifies the status of wires to delete. The status must be in uppercase letters. If you specify more than one status, enclose the status list in braces.  Note: If you select -type Special -status NOSHIELD or -type Regular -status SHIELD the software generates an error message.  "\fB-subclass <sublass_name>\fR" Specifies the subclass name of the wires to be deleted. Use this parameter if you want to delete rings, stripes, or other wires belonging to a specific subclass.  Note: You can use wildcards in <subclass_name>. Only special wire is supported by this option.  "\fB-trim_metal\fR" Deletes the trim metal attached to all patch wires, without deleting the patch wires. If -selected is also specified, deletes only the trim metal attached to the selected patch wire without deleting the patch wire.    "\fB-type {Regular| Special | Patch}\fR" Specifies whether to delete regular wires, special wires, or patch wires.  Note: If you specify Regular, omit the -shape parameter or specify -shape None.  "\fB-use {CLOCK POWER SIGNAL}\fR" Indicates that wires will be deleted on the basis of the specified use:  CLOCK: Specifies that only wires for clock nets will be deleted.  POWER: Specifies that only wires for power nets will be deleted.  SIGNAL: Specifies that only wires for general signal nets will be deleted.  "\fB-via_cell <cell_name_list>  \fR" Specifies the via cells of the vias to be deleted.  You can use wildcards while specifying the via cell names. If you are specifying multiple cell names, enclose them in braces.   "\fB-with_edit_flag {0 | 1}\fR" Deletes all modified wires, that is wires with value 1 for the isEdit property on the net.    Notes
.RS  "*" 2 As the isEdit property is added on the whole net, all the wires on the net with isEdit value set to 1 will be deleted.  "*" 2 The isEdit property is used to flag nets with modified wires and vias. This is useful when evaluating how many objects need to be modified for fixing DRC violations and then deciding whether to fix the violations manually or through ECO routing. The isEdit property is controlled through the -create_is_edit_flag parameter of setEditMode. By default, this parameter is set to 0. If you set the value of this parameter to 1, the isEdit property is set to 1 for nets with modified wires or vias.
