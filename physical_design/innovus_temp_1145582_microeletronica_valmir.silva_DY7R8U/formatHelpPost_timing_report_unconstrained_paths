.TH timing_report_unconstrained_paths  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_report_unconstrained_paths\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_report_unconstrained_paths\fR  {true | false}  
.P Default: false
.P When set to true, the report_timing command reports unconstrained paths if the software cannot find any constrained paths to report.
.P When set to false, the report_timing command reports only the constrained paths.
.P Note: The behavior of timing_report_unconstrained_paths global variable is not the same as the behavior of report_timing -unconstrained command. If there are several paths to the same endpoint from different beginpoints, including constrained and unconstrained paths, the report_timing -unconstrained parameter always reports unconstrained paths, even if a constrained path can be reported. Whereas the timing_report_unconstrained_paths global reports constrained paths but not unconstrained paths.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
