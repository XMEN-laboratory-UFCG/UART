.TH timing_enable_simultaneous_setup_hold_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_simultaneous_setup_hold_mode\fR \-  Controls whether setup and hold checks are analyzed separately, or together on the same timing graph
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_enable_simultaneous_setup_hold_mode\fR  {true | false}  Default: false 
.P Controls whether setup and hold checks are analyzed separately, or together on the same timing graph. 
.P When set to false, the setAnalysisMode -checkType setup and hold parameters are used to switch the system from analyzing setup slacks to analyzing hold slacks.
.P When set to true, setup and hold slacks are analyzed concurrently. As a consequence, both -early and -late queries for reporting commands such as report_timing can be satisfied immediately, without additional calculation. Simultaneous mode is useful for immediately understanding the consequences to both setup and hold slacks from what-if operations and manual ECOs to the design.
.P Note: Simultaneous setup and hold mode can be used only for timing analysis; it cannot be used for any physical implementation steps.    Note: Simultaneous setup/hold mode has the following behavior differences, with respect to the default mode:
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 setAnalysisMode-checkType setup and hold do not function in simultaneous mode.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 The write_timing_windows command does not generate timing window information using the min and max libraries. Instead, by default, it uses only the max libraries.

.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
