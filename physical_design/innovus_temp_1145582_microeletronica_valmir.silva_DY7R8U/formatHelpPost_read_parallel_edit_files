.SH Name \fBread_parallel_edit_files\fR \-  Loads all the specified parallel edit files and implements the editing changes recorded in them
.SH Syntax \fBread_parallel_edit_files\fR  [-help]  [-check]  [-conflict_mode {only_one stop_all}]   -files <list_of_files>   [-ignore_error]  [-report_file <file_name>] 
.P Loads all the specified parallel edit files and implements the editing changes recorded in them.
.P During parallel editing, there is a possibility of a conflict if the same attribute of an object is changed in different parallel edit files. Some cases in which a conflict can occur are listed below:
.RS  "*" 2 Two users edit the layer of the same wire segment.  "*" 2 Two users edit the width of the same NDR rule.  "*" 2 One user cuts the wire segment, and another user changes the status of the same wire.
.RE
.P In the following examples of parallel edits, there is no conflict:
.RS  "*" 2 One user edits the layer of wire, and another user edits its mask.  "*" 2 One user edits the width of an NDR rule, and another user edits its spacing.
.RE
.P In case of any conflict in the parallel edit files, the tool implements changes as per the specified conflict mode and writes the conflicting information to a report file. 
.P For information on the parallel edit flow, format of a parallel edit file, and conflict handling examples see the "Parallel Editing Capability" section in the Editing Wires chapter of the Innovus User Guide. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each read_parallel_edit_files parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man read_parallel_edit_files  "\fB-check\fR" Specifies that the tool should only check the syntax and conflict of the files but should not actually implement the changes.  "\fB-conflict_mode {only_one stop_all}\fR" Specifies the conflict mode. The two possible modes are:
.RS  "*" 2 only_one - In case of conflicting commands, the first read command is implemented and the other command is recorded in the conflict report.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 stop_all - In case of conflicting commands, the tool implements neither of the conflicting commands and records both of them in the conflict report.
.RE   "\fB-files <list_of_files> \fR" Specifies the list of parallel editing files.   "\fB-ignore_error\fR" Specifies whether errors in files should be ignored. When this option is specified, the tool skips lines with issues in the files but continues to read the other wires on the same net.  "\fB-report_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the conflict report.
