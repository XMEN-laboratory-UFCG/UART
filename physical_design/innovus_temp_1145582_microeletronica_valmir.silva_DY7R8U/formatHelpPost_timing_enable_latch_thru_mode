.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_latch_thru_mode\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_enable_latch_thru_mode\fR {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Enables the latch through analysis mode in which timing paths can propagate across latches, depending on their arrival time with respect to the latch transparency window.
.P When set to true, the arrival and required times will be propagated across a latch if it is in transparent mode. The reporting will show the entire flow through the path, rather than individual segments. This allows the overall path slack to be seen through upstream borrowing latch stages. The timing analysis, timing optimization, and reporting will consider the sequence of borrowing latch stages as a single path. As a result, the timing optimization reaches the target slack by viewing the entire path.
.P This feature provides better visibility into the overall context of latch path timing issues - for both the stage and path-level slacks. Additionally, this improves usability for debugging and manual ECOs, and shows better quality of result for Tempus ECO timing closure.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
