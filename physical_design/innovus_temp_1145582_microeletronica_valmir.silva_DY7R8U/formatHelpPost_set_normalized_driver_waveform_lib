.TH set_normalized_driver_waveform_lib  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_normalized_driver_waveform_lib\fR \-  Specifies normalized driver waveform for a library
.SH Syntax \fBset_normalized_driver_waveform_lib\fR  [-help]  [-fall_waveform <string>]  [-rise_waveform <string>]  -ref_lib <string>  -libs <string>
.P Specifies normalized driver waveform for a library. The normalized driver waveform given in the reference library is applied to all the specified libraries.
.P Note: For this command to take effect, you should set the timing_generate_normalized_driver_waveform global variable to false before loading libraries. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-fall_waveform <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the fall normalized driver waveform.  "\fB-libs <string>\fR" Specifies a list of space separated libraries to which normalized driver waveform is to be applied.   "\fB-ref_lib <string>\fR" Specifies the reference library from which normalized driver waveform is to be selected.   "\fB-rise_waveform <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the rise normalized driver waveform. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following example shows that normalized driver waveform given in $libDir/libs/ref.lib will be applied to all the cells in $libDir/1.lib $testDir/2.lib $libDir/libs/3.lib:   set_normalized_driver_waveform_lib -libs "$libDir/1.lib $testDir/2.lib $libDir/libs/3.lib" -ref_lib $libDir/libs/ref.lib
