.SH Name \fBreport_annotated_delay\fR \-  Reports coverage of annotations on a design
.SH Syntax  \fBreport_annotated_delay\fR  [-help]  [-ignore_tied_low_high_net_arcs]   [-list_annotated]   [-list_non_annotated]  [-view <viewName>]  [-max_line <number>]  [{> | >>} <filename>[.gz] | -tcl_list]  <[pin_port_list]> 
.P Reports coverage of annotations on a design. These annotations include SDF delay arc annotations. Besides SDF annotations, the command also reports annotations that are set using the set_annotated_delay command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_annotated_delay parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man report_annotated_delay.   "\fB> | >> <filename>\fR" When specified with >, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.  The <filename> parameter must be the last argument in the list. The <filename> and -tcl_list parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  Note: To write a compressed report, add the
.gz extension to the file name.  Default: Report is displayed on standard output without being saved.  "\fB-ignore_tied_low_high_net_arcs\fR" Ignores timing arcs of power and ground nets.  "\fB-list_annotated\fR" Lists detailed annotation information for the following annotated arcs:
.RS  "*" 2 annotated internal net arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated input port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated output port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 annotated cell arcs
.RE   "\fB-list_non_annotated\fR" Lists the arc information for the non-annotated arcs corresponding to the following types of arcs:
.RS  "*" 2 non-annotated internal net arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 non-annotated input port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 non-annotated output port arcs
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 non-annotated cell arcs
.RE   "\fB-max_line <number>\fR" Controls the number of output lines reported by -list_annotated or -list_non_annotated parameter.  "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Produces the report in Tcl list format instead of a tabular format. This is useful for integrating timing with custom Tcl functions, and also for customizing report generation.  The -tcl_list and <filename> parameters are mutually exclusive; you cannot specify them together.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Generates the report for the specified analysis view only. You can specify this parameter only when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner timing analysis mode. 
.SH Examples
.P If your SDF has only cell arcs, and net delays are included in the cell delays, you can report the status of annotation for cell arcs, internal net arcs, net arcs from primary inputs, and net arcs to primary outputs, and all timing arcs separately. The following report is generated for report_annotated_delay for delay arcs types:
.P report_annotated_delay  ---------------------------------------------------------  Delay Arc Type     Total    Annotated    Not Annotated    Percentage Annotated   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Cell arcs          128      0           128              0.000000  Input net arcs     14       0           14               0.000000  Internal net arcs  107      0           107              0.000000  Output net arcs    7        0           7                0.000000  ------------------------------------------------------------------  All timing arcs    256      0           256              0.000000  ------------------------------------------------------------------
