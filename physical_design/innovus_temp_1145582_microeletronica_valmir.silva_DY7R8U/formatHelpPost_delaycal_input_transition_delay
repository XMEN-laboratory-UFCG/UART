.SH Name \fBdelaycal_input_transition_delay\fR
.SH Syntax \fBdelaycal_input_transition_delay\fR 
.P Type: String
.P Default: 4ps
.P Sets the default input transition delays and the ideal clock transition time for delay calculation. 
.P The default transition will be used at all places where transition is not defined (either by set_input_transition, set_annotated_transition, or any driving cell). For all the ports/pins that do not have any driving cell in fanin (or set_input_transition/set_annotated_transition settings) will also use this default slew value.
.P Note: It is mandatory to specify time units for this command. Valid time units are ps, ns, etc.
.P In addition, the default input transition value is applied to those pins to which the slew was not propagated. For example:
.RS  "*" 2 Tiehi or tielo pins
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Macro output pins, which do not have a related input pin
.RE
.P Note: A macro output pin, which has a related input pin will most likely have slew propagation from the related input pin to the output pin.
.RS  "*" 2 Macro output pins for which all the timing arcs are disabled
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Input ports without a user-specified transition value
.RE 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following global variable sets the input transition delay to 300ps for nets that exceed 1,000 terminals:   set delaycal_input_transition_delay 300ps  The software displays the following information:  Set Input Pin Transition Delay as 300 ps.
