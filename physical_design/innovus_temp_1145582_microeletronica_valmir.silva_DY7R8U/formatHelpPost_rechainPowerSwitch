.P Enables flexible power switch enable chaining and unchaining after power switch insertion.
.P Note: It is recommended that you use this command for PSO enable chaining. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each rechainPowerSwitch parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man rechainPowerSwitch.  "\fB-backToBackChain \fR" Connects the enableNetOut at the top of a column to the enableNetIn at the top of the next column, and connects the enableNetOut at the bottom of the column to the enableNetIn at the bottom of the next column. The chain proceeds left to right or right to left. By default, the enableNetIn is connected to the bottom of each column, and the enableNetOut exits from the top of each column, in parallel.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   This parameter is optional.  "\fB-cascade\fR" Connects switches in cascade  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-cellEnablePin\fR" Provides the pin names of power switch cells when the power switch cell pin names are different than the specified instance's cell. This option is also useful in cases where all enable pins of instances are not connected by enabling a way to provide pin map.  Example:  set INST [ addPowerSwitch -getSwitchInstances -powerDomain PD1 -column    ]   rechainPowerSwitch -chainByInstances -chainYbeforeX \\  -unchainByInstances -enablePinIn SW_IN -enablePinOut SW_OUT \\  -enableNetIn NETin -enableNetOut NETout \\  -chainDirectionX RToL -reportFile pd1_chain.rpt \\  -backToBackChain \\  -cellEnablePin { { SW_withDiff_pinNames {SW_IN_1} {SW_OUT_1} }} \\  -switchInstances $INST  "\fB-chainByInstances\fR" To chain the instances. This option is used for chaining the instances defined by -selected or instances given in -switchByInstances.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Select all PSO instances of power domain ALU  set ALUinst [addPowerSwitch -column -getSwitchInstances -powerDomain ALU]  The below command make the changes in the connection of the switch enable  rechainPowerSwitch -unchainByInstances\\  -chainByInstances \\  -switchInstances $ALUinst -enablePinIn A -enablePinOut Y \\  -enableNetIn swcontrol_2 -enableNetOut swack_2 \\  -cascade -chainDirectionY BtoT  "\fB-chainByRow\fR" Gives additional control if you need to enable horizontal signal chaining. For example, in rows. By default, signal chaining is enabled from bottom to top.  "\fB-chainDirectionX <LtoR|RtoL>\fR" Defines the direction of the chain along X axis.  "\fB-chainDirectionY <BtoT|TtoB>\fR" Defines the direction of the chain along Y axis.  "\fB-chainStyle {min_length_tree single_output_chain}\fR" Specifies the chain style for enabling power switches and making enable chain connections. The specified chain styles help in optimizing the wire length with longer enable chains, and connecting all the power switches in single pass to avoid blockages. Following are the chain style values specified by this parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 min_length_tree: Connects the enable pin of the switches with a chain, which has multiple branch outputs. The following command presents the usage of this parameter value:  rechainPowerSwitch -powerDomain PD1 -selected \\  -chainStyle min_length_tree \\  -maxDistanceX 40 -maxDistanceY 100 -startLoc 200 6400 \\  -enableNetIn pso1 -enableNetOut pso1_out
....  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 single_output_chain: Connects the enable pin of the switches with a chain, which has single branch output. This parameter value can be specified with -max_distance_x and -max_distance_y parameters. The following command presents the usage of this parameter value:  rechainPowerSwitch -powerDomain PD1 -selected \\  -chainStyle single_output_chain \\  -maxDistanceX 40 -maxDistanceY 100 -startLoc 200 6400 \\  -enableNetIn pso1 -enableNetOut pso1_out
....  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE   "\fB-chainXbeforeY\fR" Defines row chain over column.  "\fB-chainYbeforeX\fR" Defines column chain over row.  This is the default option.  "\fB-enableNetIn {listOfnets}\fR" Specifies the list of input nets that the software attaches to the enable input pins. The order in which you specify these nets determines the sequence in which nets are assigned to pins. Enable nets and pins are connected automatically if they reside at the same level in the hierarchy.  "\fB-enableNetOut {<netBaseName> | {listOfNets}}\fR" Specifies the enable output nets that the software attaches to the enable output pins. The order in which you specify these nets determines the sequence in which nets are assigned to pins. If enable nets and pins reside at the same level in the hierarchy they are connected automatically. For the last switch of the ring, the -enablePinOut is tied to -enableNetOut.  "\fB-enablePinIn {listOfPins}\fR" Specifies the list of enable input pins of the buffers inside the switch cell. The order in which you specify these nets determines the sequence in which nets are assigned to pins. If enable nets and pins reside at the same level in the hierarchy they are connected automatically.The software ties the   -enablePinOut of the first switch cell to the -enablePinIn of the next switch cell in the same ring: All the enable pin of the switch cells in the same column are daisy-chained together. For the first switch of the ring, the -enablePinIn is tied to -enableNetIn.  "\fB-enablePinOut {listOfPins}\fR" Specifies the list of enable output pin(s) of the buffer(s) inside the switch cell. The order in which you specify these pins is important because nets are assigned to pins sequentially. The software ties the -enablePinOut of the first switch cell to the -enablePinIn of the next switch cell in the same column: All the enable pin of the switch cells in the same column are daisy-chained together. For the last switch of the column, the -enablePinOut is tied to -enableNetOut.  "\fB-maxDistanceX <um>\fR" Maximum X distance a switch can drive.  "\fB-maxDistanceY <um>\fR" Maximum Y distance a switch can drive.  "\fB-mergeDistanceX <um>\fR" To consider switches within this in the same column.  "\fB-mergeDistanceY <um>\fR" To consider switches within this in the same row.  "\fB-parallelEnable\fR" Connects enable Net In to all switches in parallel type connection.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-reportFile \fR" Writes switch instances and their corresponding input/output enable signal pin/net connections to the specified file name.  "\fB-reverseOrder\fR" The reverse order of the -switchInstances.  "\fB-selected\fR" Selects switches to be chained and unchained.  Note: This option must be used with -chainByInstances and   -unchainByInstances.  "\fB-switchInstances\fR" Specifies the instances to be chained/unchained. When chaining is requested, the sequence of the final chain is taken from the sequence of the instance names given in the provided list.  "\fB-unchainByInstances\fR" To unchain the instances. This option is used for unchaining the instances defined by -selected or instances given in   -switchByInstances.
