.SH Syntax \fBtiming_clock_source_use_driving_cell\fR  {true | false}   Default: true
.P When set to false, delay calculation in propagated clock mode will use an idealized driver model at the create_clock root pin or port when it calculates delays for the first stage of the clock tree. The idealized model is a ramp input with the transition time set by the system default transition, which is normally 0ns.
.P When this variable is set to true, the drive characteristics of the cell output pin that create_clock is asserted on will be used to calculate the first stage clock tree delays and slews. The input slew used for this driver model is whatever slew has been propagated to the cell's input pins from upstream logic. The arrival time of the clock at the root pin is not modified in any way.
.P If you wish to specify the input slews to be used for the clock driver cell, that is, not use the upstream propagated slews - you can use the set_annotated_transition constraint on the cell's input pins to control this. Setting an input transition of 0ns on the input pins can be useful when trying to correlate analysis results with other applications which do not use the full propagated transition times.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
