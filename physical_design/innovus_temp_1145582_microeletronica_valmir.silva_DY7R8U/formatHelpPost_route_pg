.SH Name \fBroute_pg\fR \-  Uses the Innovus database, builds the region with the help of PSDL, where the PG structure is to be created, and parses it
.SH Syntax \fBroute_pg\fR  [-help]  [-check_psdl_only]  [-delete_floating]  [-fast]  [-psdl_file <file_name>]  [-skip_block_pin]  [-skip_partial_overlap_via]  [-skip_via]  [-use_namespace]  [-write_psdl <output_file>] 
.P Uses the Innovus database, builds the region with the help of PSDL, where the PG structure is to be created, and parses it. This command also uses all the syntax in PSDL to build the PG structure.
.P The following figure presents the process of developing a PG routing flow using the route_pg command:
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each route_pg parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man route_pg  "\fB-check_psdl_only\fR" Performs sanity check only on the PSDL input file.   "\fB-delete_floating\fR" Removes floating wires.   "\fB-fast\fR" Generates PG routing flow in the Fast PG mode.   "\fB-psdl_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the PSDL input file.   "\fB-skip_block_pin\fR" Skips the formation of connection to the block pins.   "\fB-skip_partial_overlap_via\fR" Skips building of via on partial overlap intersection. See the example below:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-skip_via\fR" Skips building via object.   "\fB-use_namespace\fR" Enables the Flash PG engine to allow the same namespace/metal Id in different regions in a PSDL file.   "\fB-write_psdl <output_file>\fR" Writes a PSDL file to ensure that the input numerical/string Tcl variable is correctly calculated and applied. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks the -psdl_file syntax only (without running the route_pg command):  route_pg -fast -psdl_file <filename> -check_psdl_only  "*" 2 The following command removes a floating wire:  route_pg -fast -psdl_file <psdl_file> -delete_floating  "*" 2 The following command does not generate via while running the route_pg command:  route_pg -fast -psdl_file <psdl_file> -skip_via  "*" 2 The following command skips partial generated vias:  route_pg -fast -psdl_file <psdl_file> -skip_partial_overlap_via  "*" 2 The following command generates a PG structure in the Fast PG mode and writes a PSDL file during its run:  route_pg -fast -psdl_file <file_name> -write_psdl <output_file>  "*" 2 The above command generates a PG structure in the Complete PG mode and writes a PSDL file during its run:  route_pg -psdl_file <file_name> -write_psdl <output_file>  "*" 2 The above command checks the PSDL syntax and writes a PSDL file without generating the PG structure:  route_pg -psdl_file <file_name> -check_psdl_only -write_psdl <output_file>
