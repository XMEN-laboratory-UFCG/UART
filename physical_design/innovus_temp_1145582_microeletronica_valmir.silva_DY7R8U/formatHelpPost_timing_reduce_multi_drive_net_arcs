.SH Name \fBtiming_reduce_multi_drive_net_arcs\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_reduce_multi_drive_net_arcs\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: true
.P Controls whether multi-drive or mesh networks are reduced to simpler, single driver models. 
.P When set to true, the nets that meet the drivers' receivers arc threshold (defined using timing_reduce_multi_drive_net_arcs_threshold global variable), are reduced. The net arcs are created only from one driver or from the drivers for which you have set the constraints. 
.P If you specify constraints on the net driven by parallel buffers, it might result in increased run time and memory degradation. By specifying timing constraints through nets, the constraints are moved to the drivers. This leads to the creation of net arcs from all the drivers, thus disabling net arc reduction. In such cases, you can select one driver of the net and use that driver to specify the constraints.
.P When set to false, the number of net arcs created for timing analysis for nets driven by parallel buffers are not reduced. If a net is driven by n parallel buffers and is connected to m sink pins, then the total number of net arcs created is n*m. For example, if n is 100 and m is 20000, the number of net arcs created for timing analysis will be two million. This may result in increased run time and memory usage.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
