.SH Name \fBplacePipeline\fR \-  Places the registers of the specified pipeline flip-flops (PFF) net group(s) so that the distances between the stages of each group are roughly equal
.SH Syntax \fBplacePipeline\fR  [-netGroup {<netGroupName>}]  [-region {true | false }]  [-status {fixed | placed}  [-timingBased]  [-utilization <utilization_value>] 
.P Places the registers of the specified pipeline flip-flops (PFF) net group(s) so that the distances between the stages of each group are roughly equal. This command can be used if the pipeline net groups are specified in the design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-netGroup {<netGroupName>}\fR" Specifies the PFF net group, or a list of net groups, to place. By default, all PFF net groups in design are considered.  "\fB-region {true | false}\fR" Creates region constraints for flops in each stage of pipeline, to allow adjustments at a later stage.  Default: false  "\fB-status {fixed | placed}\fR" Places the PFFs with fixed placement status, or placed status.  Default: placed  "\fB-timingBased\fR" Automatically finds reserve lengths. The option is of type boolean and is optional.  "\fB-utilization <utilization_value>\fR" Specifies the expected utilization of regions for flops.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 1  Note: The -region option is required with the -utilization. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places the registers of all pipeline flip-flops (PFF) net groups at equal distance:   placePipeline 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places the registers of pipeline flip-flops (PFF) net group named netGroup1 at equal distance and marked the registers status FIXED:   placePipeline -netGroup netGroup1 -status fixed
