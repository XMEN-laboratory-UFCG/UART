.SH Name \fBdumpNanoCongestArea\fR \-  Writes the NanoRoute routing congestion information to an ASCll output file
.SH Syntax \fBdumpNanoCongestArea\fR  [-help]  <file_name>  [-all] 
.P Writes the NanoRoute routing congestion information to an ASCll output file. The output file reports the total number of overflowed tracks, and the coordinates of overflow cells, vertical tracks, and horizontal tracks. The following example shows the information for a gcell in the ASCII output file:
.P (1192900, 974400) (1209700, 991200) V: -1/9/24 H: 0/16/39 
.P The gcell has one vertical (V) track overflow (-1) from a layer. However, if all tracks are counted, it has nine remaining vertical tracks among 24 total tracks.
.P For horizontal (H) tracks, there was no overflow from any layer (0), and it has 16 remaining tracks among 39.
.P You can use the dumpNanoCongestArea command after running the NanoRoute globalRoutecommand. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-all\fR" Writes the congestion information for all gcells in the design to the specified output file.  "\fB<file_name>\fR" Writes the congestion information for only the most congested gcells in the design to the specified output file.  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each dumpNanoCongestArea parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command  man dumpNanoCongestArea.
