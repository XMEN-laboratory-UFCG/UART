.TH report_sequential  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreport_sequential\fR \-  Reports information about sequentials the design. Sequentials are the elements that have a library is_sequential tag.  These can be flops, latches, and clock gates
.SH Syntax \fBreport_sequential\fR  [-help]  [-deleted]   [-full]   [-hinst <hInst_names>]   [-mapped]  [-optimized]   [-out_file <string>] 
.P Reports information about sequentials the design. Sequentials are the elements that have a library is_sequential tag.  These can be flops, latches, and clock gates. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each report_sequential parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man report_sequential  "\fB-deleted\fR" Generates a report with the deleted flops and the reason.   "\fB-full\fR" Generates a report with the sequential name, whether it was inferred or instantiated, the type of sequential, and the type of reset.   "\fB-hinst <hInst_names>\fR" Hinst for the report. By default, the design is reported.  "\fB-mapped\fR" Generates a report with synthesis requirements modified to map the sequential.   "\fB-optimized\fR" Generates a report with sequentials optimized to constants or are unloaded, but have not been removed.  "\fB-out_file <file_name>\fR" File to dump the report. Default is stdout
