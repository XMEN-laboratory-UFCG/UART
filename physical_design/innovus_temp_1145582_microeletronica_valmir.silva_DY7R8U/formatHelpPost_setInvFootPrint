.SH Name \fBsetInvFootPrint\fR \-  Specifies the inverter cell footprints
.SH Syntax \fBsetInvFootPrint\fR  [-help]  [-library <libName>]  <invCellOrFootprintNames> 
.P Specifies the inverter cell footprints. The footprint names are usually assigned during design import. The Innovus software uses these inverter footprint names during timing optimization and top-level inverter insertion in a partition design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each setInvFootPrint parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setInvFootPrint  "\fB<invCellOrFootprintNames>\fR" Specifies the inverter cell footprint names or inverter cell names. When you specify an inverter cell name, the Innovus software automatically finds the cell footprint name.  "\fB-library <libName>\fR" Specifies the library name from where the cells will be picked up.
