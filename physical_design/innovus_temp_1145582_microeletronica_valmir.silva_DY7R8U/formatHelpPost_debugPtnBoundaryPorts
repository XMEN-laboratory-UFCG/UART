.SH Name \fBdebugPtnBoundaryPorts\fR \-  The debugPtnBoundaryPorts command prints out the boundary pins' debug information during partition in a log which shows how to assign the power domain for the partition pins
.SH Syntax \fBdebugPtnBoundaryPorts\fR  <-pins> 
.P The debugPtnBoundaryPorts command prints out the boundary pins' debug information during partition in a log which shows how to assign the power domain for the partition pins.
.P This is useful when debugging CPF partitions as you get the information about how Innovus assigns the power domain for the partition boundary pins during debugging. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<-pins>\fR" Specifies a list of the partition pins. If wildcard * is specified, it means all partition pins. 
.SH Example
.P Specify the partition pins(Hterm) you want to debug:  debugPtnBoundaryPorts -pins I2/d I2/clk
.P After partition, the command will execute the partition command to print the following DBG info in the log file:  DBG: deriving hterm I2/d power domain  DBG:
....
