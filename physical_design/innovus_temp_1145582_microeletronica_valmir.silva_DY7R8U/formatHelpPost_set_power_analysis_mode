.P Sets the parameters for doing the power analysis.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-add_simulation {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to add simulation if there are no simulation vectors or if all primary sources are not annotated by vectors. This parameter can be used to ensure complete design coverage. Event simulation is done for primary sources like primary input, flops, and macros.  Usage Guidelines:  This parameter is only applicable to the event-based power analysis flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method event_based).  "\fB-adjust_input_activity_in_iterations {true | false}\fR" Default: true  Specifies whether to keep the input activity fixed or automatically adjust the activity value for each iteration of state propagation.  Usage Guidelines:  This parameter is only applicable to the power target flow (set_power_analysis_mode -enable_power_target_flow true).  "\fB-adjust_macro_activity_in_iterations {true | false}\fR" Default: true  Specifies whether to keep the macro activity fixed or automatically adjust the activity value for each iteration of state propagation.  Usage Guidelines:This parameter is only applicable to the power target flow (set_power_analysis_mode -enable_power_target_flow true).   "\fB-annotation_detail_report {true | false}\fR" Specifies to generate a detailed annotation report per instance in the Vector Profiling flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method vector_profile).  When specified, it creates the AnnotationDetail.rpt file in the user-specified output directory.   Default : false  "\fB-auto_twf_delay_annotation {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to automatically detect the zero-delay vectors and perform delay annotation. As a result, you do not need to specify additional parameters (set_power_analysis_mode -use_zero_delay_vector_file and read_activity_file -zero_delay) to indicate the vectors that have delay annotation.   Usage Guidelines:  This parameter is only applicable to the event-based power analysis flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method event_based).  "\fB-average_rise_fall_cap {true | false}\fR" Default: false  When set to true, the software uses the average of rise and fall capacitance from the liberty file. This parameter can be specified for all library formats.  Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is not applicable to the -static_netlist def flow.  "\fB-binary_db_name  <filename>\fR" Default: The default file name is power.db  Specifies the name of the binary power database file (filename.db) used for analyzing power plots. This database contains instances, locations, and power.  The generated power database allows you to perform GUI interactive debugging using the Power & Rail Plots and Power Debug forms.  You can specify this parameter in scenarios where more than one database is generated and you need to track which one was generated in which mode when restoring the database, or if your design has several blocks and analysis is done on one block all the time and all the databases are named power.db.  Usage Guidelines:   You must specify this parameter with the -create_binary_db true parameter. This parameter is applicable to both the static and dynamic power calculation flows.  "\fB-block_independent_peakpower {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to identify the worst power interval of each block, and run power analysis of the full design using the worst interval of each block. This parameter allows you to perform power and current analysis for design blocks that have independent peak power intervals.  When set to false, power analysis is performed using the common worst interval found using simulation of all vectors together​​.  "\fB-boundary_gate_leakage_file <filenname>\fR" Specifies a list of Liberty side files required for boundary gate leakage (context-aware leakage) calculation. This file defines the boundary current for different threshold voltage (Vt) layers at different operating conditions. The file includes:
.RS  "*" 2 multiple leakage tables corresponding to different operating conditions.  "*" 2 leakage probability factor for different abutments (when abutting instances are on the same Vt layer or when they are on different Vt layers).
.RE   When -boundary_gate_leakage_file is specified, the power.boundarygateleakage.rpt file is dumped by default. This file contains the design-level summary for the three combinations of Vt select fail ratio (0, 1 and the one specified with HighVT_select_fail_ratio).  "\fB-boundary_gate_leakage_report {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Generates a verbose report for every abutted instance-edge for boundary leakage calculation. This detailed report is useful in debugging and understanding the leakage power calculation for an instance. The generated report name is boundarygateleakage.detailed.rpt.   "\fB-boundary_leakage_cell_property_file <filenname>\fR" Specifies the list of edge information files containing cell properties.   "\fB-boundary_leakage_edge_annotation_file <filenname>\fR" Specifies the edge annotation file with updated Vt layers at a given edge location to be used during boundary leakage calculation.  This parameter is used to provide custom Vt layers for an abutted edge at a given location to be used during power computation.  Note: When running the edge annotation feature, the user-defined VT will have precedence over the one from the cell properties file.  "\fB-boundary_leakage_multi_pgpin_support {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Enables support for cells with multiple power/ground pins.  "\fB-boundary_leakage_pessimism_removal {true | false}\fR" Default: true  Enables pessimism removal for the Source to FCs to Source abutment type.  This abutment type normally has 0 CNOD leakage. Therefore, the non-zero leakage computed at the starting S-FC and terminating FC-S boundaries needs to be removed for accurate estimation. This parameter is specified to remove the non-zero leakage or pessimism.   Revised CNOD leakage = CNOD Leakage - Leakage (S-FC-S).  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-boundary_leakage_pxe_support {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Enables the PXE feature.  PXE is used for calculation of CNOD leakage by cross row environment. The T structure or inverted T structure with both edges of the type FC is PXE.  The following diagram illustrates examples of PXE:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Every scenario other than the ones mentioned in PXE examples is non-PXE. The following diagram illustrates examples of non-PXE:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.RS  "*" 2 If this parameter is set to false, Voltus does not consider the relationship by cross row environment.  "*" 2 If this parameter is set to true, Voltus will find out the PXE or non-PXE structure and look up different leakage tables for obtaining the leakage value.
.RE   "\fB-bulk_pins {<bulk_pin_list>}\fR" Default: None  Defines power and ground bulk LEF pins for the design. Use this parameter when library cells have bulk pins defined in LEF but the liberty file does not contain power associated with these pins. If a liberty file does not have body bias definition, power analysis does not distribute power to the body bias domain.  Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is only applicable to the static power calculation flow. It does not support the -static_netlist def and dynamic power calculation flows.  "\fB-capacity {low|medium|high}\fR" Enables segmented power processing. When this parameter is specified, the software performs concurrent processing of vector simulation annotation, power calculation, and report construction.  This parameter enables performance optimization with some trade-off on memory consumption and runtime. The arguments of the -capacity parameter are:
.RS  "*" 2 low - reduces memory for a flat run.  "*" 2 medium - further reduces memory with moderate increase in runtime (1.2X).  "*" 2 high - maximum memory reduction at about 2X runtime.
.RE   The -capacity parameter is used for reducing memory when processing long simulation vectors. In case of the FSDB and SHM format activity file, the runtime can increase up to 2X.  "\fB-case_insensitive_mapping {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies whether instance name mapping between the RTL netlist and GATE level netlist in the mapping file is case-sensitive or case-insensitive. When set to true, name mappings are case-insensitive.   "\fB-clock_source_as_clock {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to use the correct clock frequency for activity calculation. If you stop the arrival of the clock signal by setting set_case_analysis to 0, the transition density at the output net of the flop is calculated using the topological source clock frequency instead of the default frequency.  When this option is set to false, then the Verilog flow will stop clock propagation for any disable clock path that is set with set_case_analysis.  Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is not applicable to the -static_netlist def flow.  "\fB-comprehensive_automapping {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to perform all-inclusive instance name mapping between the RTL netlist and GATE level netlist. When set to true, the software honors all possible naming rules (includes handling of characters like '[' , ']', '.', '/', '\\\\', '_', ':' and handling of strings like MBFF, _reg, _MB_ etc.) for better annotation coverage.   This feature is applicable to both file-based mapping (map_activity_file -rtl2gate | -two_column_mapping_file) and automatic mapping (set_power_analysis_mode -enable_auto_mapping). When -comprehensive_automapping is specified with either -rtl2gate or -two_column_mapping_file, the RTL mapping entries are given priority over the automatic rule-based mapping entries and are used to annotate the design objects.  "\fB-constant_override {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to give higher precedence to propagated constants defined using the set_case_analysis command. It allows propagated constants to override global activity.  "\fB-corner {min|max}    \fR" Default: max  Defines the library corner for the non-MMMC setup (read_lib -min | -max | -typ).
.RS  "*" 2 min corner means the power calculator will use min timing libraries for power calculation.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 max corner means the power calculator will use max timing libraries for power calculation.
.RE   Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is applicable to both the static and dynamic power calculation flows.  "\fB-create_binary_db    {true | false}\fR" Default: false  A value of true creates a binary database of power results. This database contains instances, locations, and power.  The generated power database allows you to perform GUI interactive debugging using the Power & Rail Plots and Power Debug forms.  Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is applicable to both the static and dynamic power calculation flows.  "\fB-create_driver_db{true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to generate all the flop-based drivers/receivers list. This parameter is required to run the noise margin calculation flow, and differential voltage calculation in the rush-current analysis flow. The driver/receiver pairs are generated only for the state-elements (flops) as noise margins will be calculated only for the driver-receiver pairs where flop is a receiver. Noise margins are calculated with worst voltages seen on the driver-receiver pins.  The driver/receiver list is saved in the power2rail_config.json file located in the power output directory.  Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is applicable only to the dynamic power calculation flow.  "\fB-create_gui_db {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to create a binary database of power results in the XP mode. When set to true, the tool creates sliced power database file for each rail partition and saves it to the gui.db sub-directory under the power output directory (example: power_dir/part_*/gui.db/rail_part_*/power.x.db  (x = 1, 2,
..., 14).  The generated power database allows you to perform GUI interactive debugging using the Power & Rail Plots and Power Debug forms.  Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is applicable to both the static and dynamic power calculation flows.  "\fB-current_generation_method { avg | peak }\fR" Default: avg  Specifies the method of instance current discretization (or continuous current waveform generation) based on the user-specified time step size (set_dynamic_power_simulation -resolution <<value in ps>>). The current waveform generated for an instance depends on the time step size/resolution for dynamic power simulation. The recommended value for -resolution is 20ps.  The two possible arguments of this parameter are:
.RS  "*" 2 peak - Specifies to use the peak current value of each time step. The output current filename is <filename>.ptipeak. It is recommended to use the peak method when using the Composite Current Source Power (CCSP) Liberty files. This is because the CCSP library provides real current waveforms from simulation that is used directly by the software.  "*" 2 avg  - Specifies to use the average current value of each time step. The output current filename is <filename>.ptiavg. It is recommended to use the avg method when using the non-CCSP (NLPM) library. In this case, the Voltus power engine heuristically constructs a triangular waveform from the look-up table.
.RE   Usage Guidelines: 
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is applicable only to the dynamic power calculation flow.  "*" 2 It is used only for instance current waveform generation, and does not apply to total current waveform generation. When generating total current (composite) waveform, the peak current values of all instances are summed up for each step.  "*" 2 For very small step size, the average and peak methods will converge.
.RE   "\fB-default_frequency <value>\fR" Default: 100MHz  Specifies to set the default frequency in the MHz unit for net not annotated by TWF. You can specify a numerical value without unit.  "\fB-default_slew <value>\fR" Default: For static analysis CTE flow, the default slew = 0. For TWF flow, the default slew = 0.1 * default frequency in MHz.    Specifies to set the default slew in the ns unit for net not annotated by TWF. You can specify a numerical value without unit.  Usage Guidelines:  This option depends on -default_frequency for the TWF flow. If -default_frequency is not specified, then it will take frequency of the shortest clock period.  "\fB-default_supply_voltage <value>\fR" Default: 1.0  Specifies to set a default voltage for power nets in a scenario where the power engine cannot determine the voltage of these nets.  "\fB-disable_clock_gate_clipping  {true | false}  \fR" Default: true  Specifies to enable clock gate output clipping so that the output transition density of an ICG cell does not exceed the input clock pin transition density.  "\fB-disable_leakage_scaling  {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to exclude leakage power during scaling factor computation when target power is specified using the set_power command. When set_power_analysis_mode -disable_leakage_scaling is set to true, the leakage power does not get scaled, and only the internal and switching components are scaled to meet the user-specified total power.  This parameter is relevant only for the set_power commands for which total power is specified, and has no effect for the set_power command specified with the -internal, -switching, or -leakage parameters.  "\fB-disable_static {true | false}\fR" Default: false  When set to true in the dynamic vector-based or dynamic vectorless flows, the command performs only dynamic analysis and turns-off static power calculation.   Note: When you perform static power calculation in the dynamic power analysis flow, you can use either the -disable_static or -write_static_currents parameter to enable static power calculation and write static current file. If only -disable_static is set to false and -write_static_currents is not set, the tool automatically sets -write_static_currents to true. Similarly, if -write_static_currents is set to true, and -disable_static is not set, the tool automatically sets -disable_static to false.  "\fB-distribute_switching_power {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to equally distribute the switching power among all drivers if a net has more than one driver. When set to false, stores all switching power on one of the net drivers.   "\fB-distributed_combine_report_format {none | detailed | reduced}\fR" Specifies to generate consolidated XP power reports. This parameter allows you to combine power reports that are stored across multiple partition directories to give a single unified view of power data. The possible arguments of this parameter are:
.RS  "*" 2  none - generates distributed reports.  "*" 2 reduced - generates consolidated reports for the following:
.RS  "*" 2 power.missingdata.* (static and dynamic flows)  "*" 2 power.stateprop.* (dynamic flow)  "*" 2 power.stats.setpower (dynamic flow)
.RE  "*" 2 detailed - generates consolidated reports for the following: 
.RS  "*" 2 power.rpt (static and dynamic flows)  "*" 2  power.instpwr.rpt (static flow)  "*" 2 power.lib.rpt (static flow)  "*" 2  power.pgpinpwr.rpt (static flow)  "*" 2 power.pgnet.detailed.rpt  "*" 2 power.missingdata.* (static and dynamic flows)  "*" 2 power.pgnet.detailed.rpt (static and dynamic flows)  "*" 2 power.stateprop.* (dynamic flow)  "*" 2 power.stats.setpower (dynamic flow)  "*" 2 pg_trigger.txt (dynamic flow)  "*" 2 trigger.txt (dynamic flow)  "*" 2 *.totalcurrent (dynamic flow)  "*" 2 voltus_power.cellstat (static and dynamic flows)  "*" 2 voltus_power.ptifiles (static and dynamic flows)
.RE 
.RE   "\fB-distributed_setup   <file>\fR" Default: ""  Specifies a file containing the customized setup details for running power analysis in the distributed mode.   The specified file has 4 columns:  INST/CELL <<name>> block <<power.inc>>  where,
.RS  "*" 2 INST/CELL: Keyword indicating cell or instance to be run in the distributed mode. Cell can be useful for repeated DEF blocks.  "*" 2  name: Name of the hierarchical block or instance.  "*" 2  block: Keyword block implies that only the lower level DEF will be included  "*" 2  power.inc: name of the power include file. This column is optional.
.RE   The unspecified instance/cell will be run with the top level as a single group. Each distributed block/instance should have corresponding TWF and SPEF to improve runtime.  Note: Each block will be run independently from other blocks, thus the external load or cell seen at the pin of the block can be different from flat analysis. If the partition boundary analysis is important, distributed processing is not recommended.  Usage Guidelines: 
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is not applicable to the -static_netlist verilog flow.
.RE   "\fB-decap_cell_list  <cell_list>\fR" Default: ""  Specifies the physical only cells, such as decap cells, to include in the power report.  Usage Guidelines: 
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is applicable only to the static power calculation flow.  "*" 2 This parameter is not applicable to the -static_netlist def flow.
.RE   "\fB-domain_based_clipping    {true | false}\fR" Determines the frequency to be used to clip propagated activity that is too high. When set to false, the frequency of the fastest clock in the design is used. If you set this parameter to true, the fastest clock domain on the net is used to clip propagated activity.  Default: false   "\fB-dynamic_glitch_filter   <value>\fR" Sets the absolute threshold time (in ns) for filtering glitches in net toggles.

.RE   "\fB-enable_auto_queue {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to automatically determine the queue for power jobs. This parameter is used in the Voltus-XP distributed power flow with hierarchical DEFs. In the XP flow, partitions are divided into multiple queues depending on the number of CPUs (For example, Default queue: 1 CPU, Small Queue: 2 CPUs, Medium; 4 CPUs, Large : 8 CPUs, and so on.). By default, all power partitions run on the same queue. When the parameter is set to true, the blocks can run on different queues depending on the size (number of instances) of the blocks. The -enable_auto_queue parameter will be beneficial when there are uneven power block partitions. For example, if there are some blocks with 20-30M instances and there are some with 3-5M instances. Using this parameter, bigger blocks will be automatically assigned to a bigger queue, resulting in better runtime.  "\fB-enable_auto_mapping {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to automatically perform instance name mapping between the RTL netlist and GATE level netlist.

The parameter allows you to derive a more realistic dynamic current waveform based on the exact slew load values from the
.lib dynamic current table.  "\fB-enable_dynamic_scaling {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Enables set_power scaling for dynamic power analysis. The power and scaling specifications are used to scale dynamic current on both the power and ground currents of the specified instance/cell.  This parameter honors the user-defined average (static) power for leaf-level instances and hierarchies (instances/cells/modules) along with power net specification in the dynamic current scaling flows such that the average of the dynamic current is equal to the assigned average power. When you specify this parameter, the average of the dynamic current of these leaf-level instances will match the scaled static power numbers.  Usage Guidelines:

For example, at time 0ns, instance instA is in state !I ZN (0 on input, 1 on output), and at time 71ns, the instance is in state I !ZN ( 1 on input, 0 on output). The leakage power is calculated based on the different states of instA at different time points.  "\fB-external_load_config_file <filename>\fR" Specifies to honor the user-specified load capacitance values for power calculation. This parameter allows you to specify an external load capacitance file when you have a timing window file without the EXTERNAL_LOAD constructs.  File Format:  The format of the user-specified input file is:  INST|CELL    <blockName>    <external_load_flle>  Here, the format of <external_load_flle> is:  NET|PORT       <name     > <load_value>  Examples:  Configuration file:  INST         TOP          top_wcard.load  External load file (top_wcard.load):  UNIT pF  NET   result     0.02  NET   overflow   0.02  "\fB-extraction_tech_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the extraction technology file to be used for top-level power-grid extraction.

"\fB-flatten_xpgv_block_instances    <filename>\fR" Specifies a file that includes a list of block instances that use DEF instead of xPGV for power analysis, that is, specify the instances that are not to be used as xPGV. This parameter allows you to specify a few instances of the same block that will use DEF, and the others that will use xPGV at the top-level. If you do not specify this parameter, and if both DEF and xPGV are given for a block, xPGV takes precedence over DEF.  File Format:<<block_name>> <<block_instance_name>|All|None>  In this file, you can specify if a block is using a DEF by specifying the block instance name, or with the All or None keywords. All indicates that all instances are using DEF, and None indicates that none of the instances are using DEF.

"\fB-generate_flop_ranking_data <directoryname>\fR" Specifies the name of the directory where the flop ranking data is saved. Using this parameter, you can save the flop ranking data that can be reused across different versions of the design database for the same block or transferred from the top-level to the block-level run. This parameter is used with the -reuse_flop_ranking_data parameter.   "\fB-generate_leakage_power_map_based_on_calculated_leakage {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to scale the instance leakage power by directly multiplying the user-specified scaling factor with the final calculated leakage power value, instead of scaling the leakage power value from the input dotlib.  If this parameter is not specified, the user-specified scaling factor will be applied on the leakage power values from the input dotlib.  "\fB-generate_static_report_from_state_propagation {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to directly generate the static power analysis result based on the RTL-VCD input and state-propagation. When this parameter is specified, the RTL vector power analysis flow does not require the generation of a TCF/FSDB file.  Usage Guidelines: 
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is applicable only to the dynamic propagation-based flow (vector-based/vectorless/RTL/Mixed-mode).  "*" 2 This parameter is not applicable to the -static_netlist verilog flow.
.RE   "\fB-handle_glitch {true | false}\fR" A transition is defined as a glitch when the time difference between two sequential toggles are less than half of the rise transition time + fall transition time in the vector-based static power calculation. Both static and dynamic current are derated for glitch transitions. The same derate factor is used for both power and current.  If set to true, glitch power will be identified and calculated according to this definition and it will be reported in a separate column. Switching or internal power calculation does not include power due to glitches.  If set to false, glitch power will not be identified, and the respective power will be calculated as normal signal switches. Hence, the total power will be a little higher.  Default : false    "\fB-handle_tri_state {false|true}\fR" When set to true, all tristate device enable pin values will be taken into account when determining the propagation of the activity through tristate gates.  Default : false  "\fB-hier_delimiter <character>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical delimiter in the DEF file. The default hierarchical delimiter is a forward slash (/) but can be changed by setting the -hier_delimiter parameter. You can use this parameter to override the existing hierarchical delimiter.   "\fB-honor_combinational_logic_on_clock_net {true | false}\fR" Specifies the behavior of combination logic on clock net.
.RS  "*" 2 true (default) - specifies to honor activity propagation through combinational logic.  "*" 2 false - specifies that the combination logic will be treated like a combinational clockgate.
.RE   "\fB-honor_negative_energy {true | false}\fR" A value of true specifies that Voltus will keep negative internal energy numbers from the.lib internal power table. When set to false, negative power is treated as 0.  Default : true  "\fB-honor_net_activity {true | false}\fR" Specifies to use activity from the Net section of the Switching Activity Interchange Format (SAIF) file for power calculation and optimization, and to ignore the pin-based state-dependent path delay (SDPD) activity. The default value of this parameter is true.  When this parameter is set to false, the power calculation engine can use both the net-based and pin-based activity. In this case, precedence will be given to activity from net or pin that appears later in the SAIF file.  "\fB-honor_non_mission_leakage {true | false}\fR" Supports modeling of well-to sub-leakage information when the circuit power supply is off for the level shifter cells. This is referred to as the non-mission mode leakage power calculation. The leakage power for a level shifter cell depends on the state of each PG pin. The Liberty file contains sections for PG pin conditions of each mode/state and non-mission mode leakage power for each PG pin of that mode.  When this parameter is set to true, Voltus identifies the pg_pin mode and assigns non-mission mode leakage power associated with the mode.  The use model of the non-mission mode leakage power calculation feature is:  set_power_analysis_mode -honor_non_mission_leakage true  set_power_analysis_mode -off_pg_nets {VDD VDDO}  Example:  Let us consider a level shifter cell with the PG mode retained_VDDO_off and the following pg_pin_condition:   pg_setting_value (retained_VDDO_off) {  pg_pin_condition : "!VBB*VDD*VDDI ";  pg_pin_active_state (VBB, V1);  pg_pin_active_state (VDD, V2);  pg_pin_active_state (VDDI, V2);  When you specify a list of PG nets to be turned off along with the -honor_non_mission_leakage parameter, all cells/instances that have the PG state retained_VDDO_off associated with the specified PG pin condition, will use the corresponding non-mission leakage power.  "\fB-hybrid_analysis {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to perform both vector-based and vectorless power analysis in a single session.   "\fB-ignore_control_signals {true | false}\fR" Specifies that control signals will be ignored when propagating activity. It is recommended to set this parameter to true. When set to true, the control pins (reset, preset) will not impact the sequential instance's output pin activity during activity propagation.  Default : true  "\fB-ignore_data_phase_for_clk {true | false}\fR" Specifies to ignore data frequency in the clock path for the clock instances in the design. When this parameter is set to true, the software propagates only the fastest clock pin frequency instead of the data pin frequency for activity propagation through clock network.   In the default mode (false), the software picks the fastest frequency between the data phase and clock phase on that pin.  Default : false  "\fB-ignore_glitches_at_same_time_stamp{true | false}\fR" Specifies to ignore glitches at the same transient time in the vector-based static and dynamic power analysis flow. When -ignore_glitch_at_same_time_stamp is set to true, only the last signal value change is honored, and all the preceding value changes at the same time stamp are ignored. The last signal value will overwrite the previous value for the same signal at the same time stamp, so the last value will represent the state of the signal at that time stamp.  Default : true  "\fB-ignore_inout_pin_cap {true | false}\fR" When set to true, ignores the bidirectional pin capacitances (direction : inout) defined for I/O cells in the
.lib file, when calculating switching power and internal power; this also includes the default capacitance value for inout pins.  Default : false  "\fB-ignore_end_toggles_in_profile {true | false}\fR" By default, the software profiles the toggles in the user-selected vector time window by steps including the toggles at the start/end boundary of the window. In each step, the toggles on the start boundary edge of the step is counted in the current step; the toggles on the end boundary edge is counted in the next step.  When this parameter is set to false, the toggles on the end boundary edge is also counted in the last step, as there is no next step to it. This may lead to double count of the power profile for the last step, especially for zero-delay vector profiling. The default of this parameter is false.  When this parameter is set to true, the software ignores the toggle on the end boundary of the last step.  "\fB-include_seq_clockpin_power  {true | false}\fR" Reports the clock pin power of flip-flops as part of the clock network power.  Default : false  "\fB-include_timing_in_current_file {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to write timing bits for non-switching instances in the current files during the state-propagation-based flow. When specified, rail analysis will report effective instance voltage (EIV) for both switching and non-switching instances.

Usage Guidelines:   This parameter is only applicable to the state-propagation-based vectorless flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method dynamic_vectorless -enable_state_propagation true).  "\fB-ir_derated_timing_view <view_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the timing view used to calculate timing slack and to rank the flops in the Tempus PI flow. This parameter must be specified if there are multiple views.  The -ir_derated_timing_view parameter defines the timing view used to detect the IR-sensitive paths using a lower voltage than the actual analysis. This lower voltage simulates the IR-drop for each instance in the design. The software uses this view to prioritize the end-points that need to be prioritized for switching.  "\fB-keep_clock_gate_ratio_in_iterations {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies whether to keep the clock gate output (CGO) fixed or automatically adjust the value for each iteration of state propagation.  Usage Guidelines:This parameter is only applicable to the power target flow (set_power_analysis_mode -enable_power_target_flow true).   "\fB-leakage_scale_factor_for_temp <scale>\fR" Performs a linear scaling of the leakage power for temperature in all libraries. This replaces the k-factor for temperature in the
.lib file. For process and voltage, the scaling will continue to be based on the corresponding k-factors in the
.lib file. A value of 0.8 scales the leakage power in the library to 80 percent. A value of 1.2 scales the leakage power in the library to 120 percent.  Default : 1  "\fB-library_preference {voltage | ecsm_ccsp}\fR" Instances of the same cell can be attached to different power domains in a design. If you have specified different PVT libraries, then the software will by default bind each instance to the closest library definition.  You can use this parameter to select either the closest Effective Current Source Model (ECSM)/Composite Current Source-power (CCSP), or the closest voltage library for the instance:
.RS  "*" 2 voltage: when specified, enables library binding to the closest voltage library.  "*" 2 ecsm_ccsp: when specified, enables library binding to the closest ECSM/CCSP library.
.RE   The default is voltage.  "\fB-mbff_toggle_behavior { simultaneous | independent | sbff }\fR" Specifies the toggle behavior of multi-bit flip-flops (MBFF). The possible arguments are:
.RS  "*" 2 simultaneous: The multiple bits of the MBFF will toggle or not toggle at the same time. The MBFF will be considered as one flip-flop.  "*" 2 independent: The multiple bits of the MBFF will toggle independently. The MBFF will be considered as one flip-flop.  "*" 2 sbff: The MBFF will be considered as multiple Single-Bit Flip-Flops (SBFFs). Each bit will be considered as one flip-flop, and will toggle independently.
.RE   The default value is independent.  "\fB-merge_switched_net_currents { true | false}\fR" Specifies to merge switched net currents into always-on currents. For designs with a large number of switched nets, this parameter helps improve performance by merging switched net instance currents with always-on instance currents. However, when this parameter is set to true, you will not be able to use the generated current files to run power-up analysis.  Default : false   "\fB-method {  static | dynamic_vectorless | dynamic_vectorbased  | dynamic_mixed_mode | event_based | vector_profile}\fR" Specifies the type of analysis to be performed. You can perform two types of power analysis, namely static and dynamic.
.RS  "*" 2 static - specifies to perform static power analysis to calculate average power.
.RE   Dynamic power analysis can be a vector-based or vectorless approach.
.RS  "*" 2 dynamic_vectorbased - uses the full VCD output of a logic simulator to identify the instances that are switching and when they switch.  "*" 2 dynamic_vectorless - uses the timing arrival window information from a static timing analysis tool to determine when instances switch. A timing arrival window describes when a signal can change within a clock cycle. An additional algorithm then determines the instances that switch.  "*" 2  dynamic_mixed_mode - specifies to combine the vector-based and vectorless (mixed) dynamic analysis. This flow can be used in the following cases:
.RS  "*" 2 case 1: vectors are not available for every block of a full-chip design.   In this case, the software uses the vectorless methodology for blocks with incomplete vectors  "*" 2  case 2: blocks with vectors having unannotated combinational/ sequential logic.   In this case, the software performs state propagation for the missing combinational/ sequential logic. It uses the vectorless methodology for a logic cone that does not have the primary inputs or flops annotated from the vector, and then performs state propagation  To enable the dynamic mixed mode analysis flow, you must specify the following commands:  set_default_switching_activity -clock_gates_output 2.0 -global_activity <activity>  set_power_analysis_mode -method dynamic_mixed_mode  read_activity_file -scope <> -block <> -> (for available blocks)
.RE  "*" 2 event_based - specifies to enable event-based power analysis. This method supports multiple power analysis flows simultaneously. When specified, the tool performs accurate state-based power estimation for all events of a scenario in a design. Event-Based Power Analysis is applicable to all event-based vectors, such as VCD, FSDB, SHM, and PHY.  You can specify this method to generate and analyze multiple types of power analysis flow reports in a single run. The following table shows the additional options required for the different flows:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)

.RE   Default : static  "\fB-min_leaf_count <value>\fR" Specifies the minimum number of leaf instances required for writing the hierarchy data in the profiling database. It allows you to restrict the number of hierarchies for which waveforms are reported in the profiling database when using both the -write_profiling_db and  report_power -hierarchy parameters.  The default value of this parameter is 0. Any hierarchy whose leaf instance count in its complete sub-tree is less than the -min_leaf_count value will be skipped from getting reported in the profiling database. This parameter can be used to skip very small hierarchies and as a result save on the database writing time and disk space.  "\fB-multi_scenario_simulation {true | false}\fR" Specifies to create a long vector by combining multiple vectors​ and to identify the worst power intervals across the combined vector. The long vector includes all scenarios that are used sequentially and are non-overlapping​.

Default : false  "\fB-off_pg_nets <net>_list  \fR" The name of the power rails that will be turned off. The net name can contain instance hierarchy if appropriate. This data will be taken  into account when figuring out the list of power gates which are switched off.  Note:  A net is turned off if all connected power gates are turned off by control signals. When a net is off, all of the instances connected to the net will only contribute leakage current into the connecting nets.  "\fB-output_current_data_prefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies a prefix to the static or dynamic current files generated by the software. When power analysis is done in the multi-CPU mode, the output current data directory name and the underlying current files will also use the same prefix by default.  "\fB-partition_count <value>\fR" Default: 0  ​Specifies the number of physical partitions or jobs for a distributed run in the area-based partitioning flow.   Usage Guidelines: 
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only applicable to the event-based power analysis flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method event_based) in the XP mode.  "*" 2 This parameter must be specified with the -use_physical_partition parameter. 
.RE   "\fB-partition_twf {true | false}\fR" Specifies to read the input TWF data (flat or hierarchical TWF files), and generate block-level TWFs.    The default is false. This parameter must be specified when the block/partition level TWF files are not available.  "\fB-pin_based_twf {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether to generate pin-based TWF or net-based TWF. The default value is false.
.RS  "*" 2 When set to false, a net-based TWF file is generated. Net-based TWF file is smaller in size and therefore results in faster processing.  "*" 2 When set to true, a pin-based TWF file is generated. Pin-based TWF file is bigger in size and requires longer processing time, however, is more accurate because the slews numbers are pin-based.
.RE   Note: This parameter must be used with the read_sdc command.  "\fB-power_grid_library  { <library_list> }\fR" Specifies the name of the Cadence power cell libraries (.cl). You can also specify a list of defined power-grid libraries having decap cells tagged in them.  Note: When specifying a list of PGVs to power analysis using the set_power_analysis_mode command, you must specify the technology library as the first PGV library in the list, followed by the standard and macro PGV libraries. The selection between the standard and macro PGV library is order based. Therefore, if multiple power-grid libraries are specified for a cell, the power engine maps the cell with the first library after the technology library.  "\fB-power_include_initial_x_transitions {true | false}\fR" Controls how the initial X state toggle should be counted. The initial X state means the state at time 0.  The default value is true. This means that the software counts the power caused by the X->0 or X->1 toggle. When set to false, the software does not count the power caused by the initial X state toggle.  "\fB-power_match_state_for_logic_x  <value>\fR" Controls how the logic X will be evaluated in the boolean function of the 'when' state of a power table. The default value is 0.  The parameter uses the following arguments:
.RS  "*" 2 0 - regards X as 0
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 1 - regards X as 1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 x/X - regards X as neither 0 nor 1, that is, whenever there is any X logic in it, the boolean function will be evaluated false.
.RE   "\fB-precision <value>  \fR" Specifies precision of decimal range [1-8] to ensure consistent decimal places are displayed for each power component. The default value is 8. This parameter is used for precision handling in report_instance_power and report_power.  "\fB-pre_simulation_empty_period <period>\fR" Specifies to add an empty pre-simulation period before simulation during IR drop analysis. Power analysis is not done for the pre-simulation period and flat dynamic currents are created.   "\fB-pre_simulation_period <period>\fR" Specifies to set a pre-simulation period for IR drop analysis. Pre-simulation is used for generating power analysis reports and dynamic currents.   "\fB-pre_simulation_power_exclude_period <period>\fR" Specifies to exclude power analysis during the pre-simulation period used for IR drop analysis. Pre-simulation is used only to create dynamic currents and not used for power reports.   "\fB-quit_on_activity_coverage_threshold <threshold_value>\fR" Specifies the activity (VCD/FSDB/TCF) coverage threshold value. This parameter allows you to control the acceptable activity coverage that you are expecting and enforce the software to quit when it does not meet the criteria. When you specify the threshold value, the software exits if the real activity coverage is below the threshold.  "\fB-read_rcdb {true | false}\fR" Specifies to write a SPEF file containing only the total C for signal nets and pass it to the Dynamic Power engine. Dynamic power analysis requires only the total C for signal nets. Therefore, instead of writing a large SPEF file (with distributed RC) from the RCDB, this parameter specifies to create and pass a SPEF file with only total C for all the signal nets. This significantly reduces the parasitic annotation time in the Dynamic Power engine.  Default : false  "\fB-relax_arc_match {true | false}\fR" Specifies to relax arc match when the exact arc is not found in a
.lib. When set to true, the internal energy is calculated as an average of multiple arcs with relaxed arc matching. If this parameter is set to false, relaxed arc search is not done and 0 internal energy is returned.  Default : true  "\fB-report_black_boxes {true | false}\fR" Specify this parameter to report cells that are used as black boxes.  A black box is a cell which is either missing from the liberty file or has no functionality defined in the liberty file.  Default : false  This is an optional parameter.  "\fB-report_idle_instances {true | false}\fR" Specifies to generate a report (idleinstance.rpt) that lists all the idle or non-switching instances.  The default value is false.  The following is a snippet of the idleinstance.rpt report:  DFF22/DFF    F  DFF42/DFF    F 
...  Here, the first column is the instance name and the second column is the type of instance (F indicates flop and C indicates combinational).  "\fB-report_instance_switching_info {all | output_logic | none}\fR" Specifies to generate a report for combinational instance switched during state-propagation. In the output file, it contains the toggle time, instance name, input pin event, and output pin event for each switching event of the combination gate. The possible arguments of this parameter are:
.RS  "*" 2 all - Specifies to report instance toggle information for both input and output pins. When this parameter is set to all, the switching of both the input and output pins of all the instances are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchinst file and the switching of flops are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchsrc file.  "*" 2 output_logic - Specifies to report instance toggle information for the output pins only. When this parameter is set to output_logic, the switching of the output pins of all the instances are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchinst file and the switching of flops are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchsrc file.  "*" 2 none - Disables generation of instance toggle report. This is the default option. When this parameter is set to none, only switching of flops are reported in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchsrc file. The file does not report switching of instances.
.RE   The default value is none. This parameter is used for generating switching details of state-propagation and should be specified only for debugging purpose.  The following is a snippet of the voltus_power.stateprop.switchinst report:  *------------------------------------------------  *Switch Time   Instance Name   Pin Name   Logic  *------------------------------------------------  *     0.097        B11/BUFF         I        rise       0.097        DFF11/DFF        Q        rise

This parameter is useful in viewing and debugging user defined activity factors.  Default : false  "\fB-report_time_display_fraction_digits <value>\fR" Sets the number of fractional digits or decimal places displayed for the instance switching time values in the voltus_power.stateprop.switchinst file. This parameter displays fractional digits that show the exact time difference if there are two events (rise/fall) of an instance switching at the same time.  Default : -1  "\fB-report_twf_attributes {detailed | summary}\fR" Controls the generation of the TWF attribute report based on the TWF attributes that are specified using the set_twf_attribute command.  The possible arguments are:
.RS  "*" 2 summary - generates a summarized static timing analysis report voltus_power.twf_attribute.summary that displays the number of user-defined TWF attributes (delay, slew, and slack values for both the rise and fall transitions) and the number of annotated TWF attributes for dynamic power analysis. The following is a snippet of the report:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 detailed - generates a detailed static timing analysis report voltus_power.twf_attribute.detailed that includes the summary report, and a detailed report of the rise and fall transitions for the TWF attributes of each annotated instance/pin. It also includes the shift arrival time report.   This argument also allows you to generate a report voltus_power.twf.rpt containing the TWF statistics to highlight clock-frequency and delay used for the static and dynamic power calculation.  The TWF statistics report is generated only if:
.RS  "*" 2 the read_twf command is specified before set_power_analysis_mode  "*" 2 the set_power_analysis_mode -method static -static_netlist def or set_power_analysis_mode -method dynamic_vectorless | dynamic_vectorbased command is specified.
.RE  The format of the voltus_power.twf.rpt report is:  # Voltus TWF Statistics  # Units: Freq (Hz), Delay (second), Slew (second)  # TWF File List:  # <    TWF_file1>  # <    TWF_fileN>  USER DEFINED TWF ATTRIBUTE STATISTICS  <Clock Freq> <Min Rise_Delay> <Rise Delay> <Max Rise Delay> <Min Fall Delay> <Fall Delay> <Max Fall Delay> <Net>  The USER DEFINED TWF ATTRIBUTE STATISTICS section is included in the report only if the TWF attributes are defined using the set_twf_attribute command.
.RE   Example:  #check all instances of inst_C1 get shifted by 3ns  set_twf_attribute -pin inst_C1 -shift_arrival_time 3  #check all instances of inst_D1 get shifted by 3ns  set_twf_attribute -net inst_D1 -shift_arrival_time 3  set_power_analysis_mode -method dynamic_vectorless -create_binary_db false -disable_static false -enable_state_propagation true -current_generation_method peak -power_grid_library /../library_pv.cl -report_twf_attributes summary  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified parameters to their default values.  When you specify only the -reset parameter, the software resets all parameters for the set_power_analysis_mode command.  When resetting specific parameters, the -reset parameter must be the first followed by the specific parameter. For example, you can specify the following command to reset only the -method parameter while keeping all other parameters' values unchanged:  set_power_analysis_mode -reset -method  Note:  When resetting a specific parameter, you must not specify any arguments for that parameter.  "\fB-reuse_flop_ranking_data <directoryname>\fR" Specifies the name of the directory where the flop ranking data to be reused is placed.   "\fB-reuse_flop_ranking_data_hier <blockname>\fR" Allows you to choose the block/hierarchy whose ranking data is to be used for the block-level analysis. This parameter is used when the flop ranking data is transferred from a top-level analysis where blocks are flattened to another block-level analysis. The -reuse_flop_ranking_data_hier parameter enables you to specify the required block if the top-level contains multiple instantiations of the same DEF block.   "\fB-save_bbox {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to save the boundary box of each instance, its placement, and rotation at the top level. When set to true, generates the power database with each instance boundary box, placement, and rotation information at the top level.  Usage Guidelines:  This parameter must be specified when generating the Voltus thermal model.   "\fB-scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency {true | false}\fR" Specifies to enable the VCD clock frequency to be scaled up to the SDC clock frequency. This allows you to match the VCD clock to the SDC clock to run analysis. By default, the clock frequency is scaled based on the activity file (Default: false). When you set the -scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency parameter to true, the power report and current waveforms apply the after-scaled clock frequency.  The default behavior for clock frequency scaling in the RTL and Gate level VCD flows is different, as described below:
.RS  "*" 2 RTL VCD - By default, the clock frequency is scaled to the SDC clock frequency (-scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency true) when the RTL VCD flow is enabled (set_power_analysis_mode -enable_rtl_vectorbased_dynamic_analysis true).   You can disable clock frequency scaling by setting the set_power_analysis_mode -scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency parameter to false.  "*" 2 Gate VCD - By default, scaling of the clock frequency is disabled (-scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency false)
.   You can enable the VCD clock frequency to be scaled up to the SDC clock frequency by setting the set_power_analysis_mode -scale_to_sdc_clock_frequency parameter to true. This works only when set_power_analysis_mode -use_zero_delay_vector_file is set to true, which means that the gate VCD is a zero-delay gate VCD.
.RE   "\fB-scan_chain_activity {design_name  chain_name  activity_number} | {vectorless  activity_number}\fR" Specifies to either provide vectorless activity for all scan chains or provide a specific activity for a specific chain. This parameter allows you to specify vectorless or user-defined activity to scan chains.  The following are the two use models:
.RS  "*" 2 Generate the scan control file for a specific chain:  set_power_analysis_mode -scan_chain_activity {design_name  chain_name  activity_number}  "*" 2 Generate the scan control file for all scan chains:  set_power_analysis_mode -scan_chain_activity {vectorless  activity_number}
.RE   The  -scan_chain_activity parameter is supported only in the XP mode.  "\fB-scan_chain_name {<design_name   chain_name   pattern>}\fR" Specifies to automatically generate a scan-chain control file from a scan-chain based DEF file for the shift mode scan-chain analysis. This parameter allows you to create a control file for a large-sized DEF containing long chains or for multiple-DEF files. The generated scan-chain control file is saved in the power output directory.  The use model of the parameter is:
.RS  "*" 2 -scan_chain_name {all pattern} - generate scan control file for all scan chains.  Example: -scan_chain_name {all 11010}  "*" 2 -scan_chain_name {design_name  chain_name  pattern} - generate scan control file for a specific chain.  Example: -scan_chain_name{counter AutoChain_1_seg1_clk_rising 10010}
.RE   Using this parameter, you can generate the control file for both flat and hierarchical DEFs.  "\fB-scan_control_file <filename>  \fR" Specifies the scan control file name required to run the Scan Mode Analysis flow.  The scan control file contains details about the scan analysis mode used for testing. For more information, refer to scan_fileScan Control File Format.  "\fB-scan_mbff_chain_type <type>\fR" Specifies the type of multi-bit scan flip-flop.
.RS  "*" 2 liberty - specifies to use the syntax in Liberty to decide the multi-bit flip-flop type.  "*" 2 serial - specifies to pick the first flop as the starting flop, and treat the scan chain as serial, regardless of
.lib.  "*" 2 parallel - specifies to treat the scan chain as parallel, regardless of
.lib.
.RE   "\fB-settling_buffer <value>\fR" Specifies the settling buffer time (in ps unit) between multiple windows of a VCD file. This parameter is used when you specify multiple pairs of the start time and end time for the non-overlapping multiple windows specified in an activity file (using the read_activity_file command).  Multiple current waveforms representing multiple VCD windows are merged into a single continuous current waveform. To capture the waveform for signals at the edge of user windows, a buffer time is added between the windows being stitched. This buffer time ensures that the stitched waveform is contiguous. The generated waveform hence has the duration of user windows and the intervening settling buffers. The default settling buffer period is 400ps.  You must specify the buffer value without unit.  The following is an example of this feature:  set_power_analysis_mode -verbosity true \\      -settling_buffer 200 -report_missing_nets true  read_activity_file \\      -format  VCD -scope  adder/u1 \\      -start  {0ps 2000ps} -end    {1100ps 3100ps} \\      -block 
../vcd/dut_5buf_full_chip.vcd  "\fB-smart_window {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to enable the smart window feature to extract peak power scenarios from a vector-based activity file. A smart window is a variable size window to capture maximum regions of high power dissipation. An activity file can have multiple variable-sized regions that are ranked in the descending order of power metric​.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   The use model of the parameter is:  set_power_analysis_mode -smart_window true​  set_power_analysis_mode -worst_step_size< value>  set_power_analysis_mode -worst_window_type [ power | activity | delta_power | delta_activity | ir | critical_inst_power ]  "\fB-split_bus_power {true | false}\fR" A value of false applies the internal power number to each individual bit.  A value of true divides the internal power number by bus width, before applying it to the bus bit.  Default : false  "\fB-state_dependent_leakage {true | false}\fR" When set to false, power analysis performs state independent leakage power calculation.  Default : true  "\fB-stateprop_ignore_unannot_pins {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to ignore unannotated pins in the functional logic of output pins for the RTL propagation flow.  This parameter is set to true if there are unannotated input pins for instances and such pins are used in the functional logic of output pins that are propagated. For example output pin Q is propagated with functional logic A & B where A is unannotated and might cause wrong propagation for the Q pin.   "\fB-static_multi_mode_scenario_file <filename>\fR" Specifies a file with information on instance scaling scenario for the static multi-mode IR analysis flow. When this parameter is specified, Power Analysis creates the multi-mode static current file that is used during rail analysis. The format of the input file is:  INST_NAME       PIN_NAME        SCALE_FACTOR_1      
.....   SCALE_FACTOR_N  Here, the first column indicates the macro instance name, the second column indicates the pin name, followed by multiple current scaling factors. Each column of the scaling factor is referred to as a scenario. You must specify positive values only for scale factors.

In the following example, scale factor value 0.45 will be used in the 3rd and 4th scenario for instanceC, and scale factor value 0.35 will be used in the 4th scenario for instanceD:  instanceA VDD 0.45 0.55 0.65 0.31  instanceB VDD 0.31 0.5 0.67 0.21  instanceC VDD 0.25 0.45  instanceD VDD 0.31 0.25 0.35  "\fB-static_netlist {verilog | def}\fR" Specifies to perform static power analysis using a Verilog or DEF only neltist.   By default, the static power analysis is performed using the Verilog netlist as the primary netlist. Using this parameter, you can specify DEF when a DEF netlist with logical connectivity is available, and use it as primary and not consider the Verilog netlist.  This parameter is also enabled when set_rail_analysis_mode -report_power_in_parallel is true for static power computation.  Default : verilog  "\fB-start_time_alignment {true |false}\fR" Specifies to align all the signals of the activity file at time zero. When set to true, the simulation period is max(endtime - starttime). When it is false, the simulation period is max(endtime)-  min(startime).  Default : true  Note:  This parameter is not supported in the vector profiling flow. In the vector profiling flow, the start time will always be the min(starttime) and the end time will always be max(endtime).  "\fB-switching_power_on_rise_only {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to perform switching power analysis only for rise toggles.   "\fB-thermal_input_file <file>  \fR" Specifies to read a power map file to perform thermal analysis. Thermal input file contains die area divided into tiles, and temperature value for each tile. This temperature of each tile is used to calculate power of all the instances that fall in that tile's bounding box.  The format of the thermal input file is:  DIE_TEMPERATURE_MAP   DIE_AREA   xmin(um) ymin(um) xmax(um) ymax(um) nx(int) ny(int)  NUMBER_OF_LAYERS    nLayers(int)  LAYER    layer_name(string)   TEMPERATUREXCOOR    x0(0)    x0(1)    x0(2)...

"\fB-use_physical_partition {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Enables tile or area-based partitioning of a design for distributed processing. When this parameter is specified, the top-level design is divided into physical tiles, which are then grouped to ensure that each group or partition has the same instance count. Each partition is considered and processed as a separate job.  Usage Guidelines: 
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is only applicable to the event-based power analysis flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method event_based) in the XP mode.  "*" 2 This parameter must be specified with the -partition_count parameter. 
.RE   "\fB-use_zero_delay_vector_file {true | false}\fR" Enables zero delay mode in vector-based dynamic analysis to avoid pessimism in current estimation.

"\fB-worst_case_vector_activity  {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to use the worst activity value when multiple vectors are specified in the static power calculation flow.  "\fB-worst_step_size <value>\fR" Default: Total simulation duration/100  Specifies the step size or resolution for vector profiling. Activity/ Power profiling is carried out for every step size that you specify.  When this parameter is used with -worst_window_size, the specified step size is the resolution at which window sliding is performed. The supported time units are s, ms, us, ns, and ps. If no explicit time unit is specified, the default ns will be applied.  "\fB-worst_window_count <value>\fR" Default: 1 (implements single worst window)  Specifies the number of worst windows from the last vector profile run to be used for dynamic power analysis.

.RE   Use Model:  set_power_analysis_mode -method event_based -worst_window_coverage tile  report_power -outfile power.rpt -power_density_tiles 100  This flow should be run with -method event_based.  When the -worst_window_coverage tile parameter is specified, you should include any one of the following parameters to specify the total number of tiles:
.RS  "*" 2 report_power -power_density_tile_size " 15 15 "  "*" 2 report_power -power_density_tiles_row_col " 2 2 "  "*" 2 report_power -power_density_tiles 100

"\fB-worst_window_reports {full | worst | both}\fR" Specifies to generate static power analysis reports for the specified worst window type. The possible arguments are:
.RS  "*" 2 full: creates the static power report for the full simulation window specified with the -start/-end parameters of the read_activity_file command.  "*" 2 worst: creates the static power report for the worst window only.  "*" 2 both: creates the static power report for both the full simulation and worst windows.
.RE   The default value is full.  The worst window report is created with '.1' added in the file name, as shown below:
.RS  "*" 2 Static reports for full simulation: power.rpt.avgpwr, power.rpt.instpwr  "*" 2 Static reports for worst window: power.rpt.1.avgpwr, power.rpt.1.instpwr
.RE   "\fB-worst_window_size <value>\fR" Default: None  Specifies the duration of dynamic analysis. This parameter is used for sliding window vector profiling that involves sliding the profiling windows by using a very small resolution value to get the window with the worst current profile. -worst_window_size must be specified with -worst_step_size.  The supported time units are s, ms, us, ns, and ps. If no explicit time unit is specified, the default ns will be applied.  "\fB-worst_window_type { power | activity | delta_power | delta_activity | ir | critical_inst_power }\fR" Default: power  Specifies the window type to be used for multi-window analysis. The possible arguments are:
.RS  "*" 2 power - worst instance power  "*" 2 activity - worst instance activity  "*" 2 delta_power - worst dp/dt (rate of change of power)  "*" 2 delta_activity - worst da/dt (rate of change of activity)  "*" 2 ir - worst IR  "*" 2 critical_inst_power - worst power for critical/IR-sensitive instance (worst timing and IR)
.RE   "\fB-write_boundary_leakage_edge_annotation {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Writes an edge annotation summary file for boundary leakage calculation. This parameter is used to report location-based Vt layer information on all the abutted edges in the design. The generated report name is boundarygateleakage.edgeannotation.rpt.   "\fB-write_default_uti {true | false}\fR" Default: true  For instances that are not hooked to any power/ground rail, the current for these instances are reflected in the default static current files:
.RS  "*" 2 static_default_ground_rail.ptiavg  "*" 2 static_default_power_rail.ptiavg
.RE   "\fB-write_dynamic_currents {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to create dynamic current files either for full simulation duration or for user-specified duration.  Usage Guidelines:  This parameter is only applicable to the event-based power analysis flow (set_power_analysis_mode -method event_based).  Example:  set_power_analysis_mode -method event_based -write_dynamic_currents true -enable_state_propagation true  read_activity_file sim.vcd -format VCD  report_power -outfile power.rpt  "\fB-write_profiling_db {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Writes out profiling databases which can later be viewed as histograms using the SimVision interface. You can specify this parameter during both the activity and power vector profiling.  The profiling databases support instance level and power/ground net histograms. It creates an output file name with the *.trn extension.  "\fB-write_simulation_db {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to save functional waveforms for each instance when parsing a vector-based activity file. When set to true, creates SimVision waveform database (SHM database) for toggle simulation used during power analysis, which can later be viewed as histograms using the SimVision interface.   The simulation database (shmdb.trn) is generated in the power analysis output directory.   "\fB-write_static_currents {true | false}\fR" Default: false  A value of true tells Voltus to generate the current data files per net.  Note:  When you perform static power calculation in the dynamic power analysis flow, you can use either the -disable_static or -write_static_currents parameter to enable static power calculation and write static current file. If only -disable_static is set to false and -write_static_currents is not set, the tool automatically sets -write_static_currents to true. Similarly, if -write_static_currents is set to true, and -disable_static is not set, the tool automatically sets -disable_static to false.  "\fB-x_count_transition_using_3_states {true | false}\fR" Default: false  Specifies to calculate the toggle rate using 3 states, pre-previous, previous and current states.   "\fB-x_transition_factor  <value>\fR" When using VCD/FSDB, one can specify how transitions to and from X are counted. These transitions are defined as shown in Table 5-1. Transitions to and from the X state will be treated as full transitions multiplied by the specified factor.  Note:  0 -> X -> 1 or 1 -> X -> 0 count as full transitions and they are not controlled by the parameter.  Default : 0.5  "\fB-z_transition_factor <value>\fR" When using VCD/FSDB, one can specify how transitions to and from Z are counted. These transitions are defined as shown in Table 5-1. Transitions to and from the Z state will be treated as full transitions multiplied by the specified factor.  Note:  0 -> XZ-> 1 or 1 -> Z-> 0 count as full transitions and they are not controlled by the parameter.  Default : 0.25  "\fB-zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift <value>\fR" Specifies to shift the current waveform in the zero-delay VCD flow. This parameter is useful in removing the idle period for the current waveform result with a long idle period (small flat current) before the first high current peak because of delay annotation. The parameter allows to offset the idle period from the delay values.   The use model is given below:  set_power_analysis_mode -zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift -3.0ns  The default value is 0ns. The supported time units are s, ms, us, ns, and ps. The default unit is ns. You can specify a negative or a positive value. A positive value means right shift in the timeline or add more delay to the original arrival time, and a negative value means left shift in the timeline or trim the unwanted idle period.  The -zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift parameter enables you to make a more realistic current waveform that can be easily aligned with the other current waveforms.  Note: This parameter is similar to the set_twf_attribute -shift_arrival_time parameter, with the only difference that -zero_delay_vector_toggle_shift supports both positive and negative values while -shift_arrival_time supports only a positive value.
