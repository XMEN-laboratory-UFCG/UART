.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_skew_group_delay\fR \-  By default, this command returns the longest source-to-sink delay for the specified skew group
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_skew_group_delay\fR  [-help]  [-check_type {setup | hold}]  [-delay_corner delay_corner]  [-delay_type {early | late}]  [-edge {rise | fall}]   [-exclude_pin_insertion_delays]  -skew_group <skew_group_name>   [-skew | -longest | -shortest ]  [-path_length <distance_metric> | -summarize_stage_depth <cell_type_list>]  [-all_active_sinks | -to pin | -from pin | -through pin]  [-virtual_delays_only | -real_delays_only]  [-wire_delays_only | -cell_delays_only]
.P By default, this command returns the longest source-to-sink delay for the specified skew group. Alternatively, you can use -shortest to return the shortest source-to-sink delay, or -skew to return the difference between the shortest and longest source-to-sink delay.
.P Optional arguments let you restrict the set of pins considered. For example, use -to to return the longest delay to the specified sink pin, use -delay_type and -delay_corner to specify how delays are calculated, and use -wire_delays_only to specify which delays are considered. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_ccopt_skew_group_delay parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man get_ccopt_skew_group_delay.   "\fB-all_active_sinks\fR" Specifies that the result should be a tcl dict of pairs of sink and delay, describing delays for all the active sinks of the skew group. For example, {sink_a latency_a sink_b latency_b
... sink_n latency_n}.  "\fB-cell_delays_only\fR" Specifies that CCOpt only considers cell delays when calculating delays and ignores wire delays.  "\fB-check_type {setup | hold}  \fR" Specifies whether to use setup or hold timing as the check type to use for the specified skew group.  If a check type is specified, but the -delay_type parameter is not specified, the software behaves in the following manner:
.RS  "*" 2 -check_type -setup will mean -delay_type -late  "*" 2 -check_type -hold will mean -delay_type -early
.RE   Note: If a check type is not specified, the software will always look at what the views permit, preferring the setup view if there is a choice.  "\fB-delay_corner <delay_corner>\fR" Specifies the delay corner to use when calculating delays.  If this parameter is not specified, the software will use the delay corner specified using the CCOpt property, primary_delay_corner. However, if no valid delay corner is found, the software will error out.  Note: For detailed help on the CCOpt property, primary_delay_corner, run the following command:  get_ccopt_property -help primary_delay_corner  "\fB-delay_type {early | late}\fR" Specifies whether to use early or late half delays.
.P When early is specified, CCOpt uses only early path timing data to calculate delay, for the clock edge specified. When late is specified, CCOpt uses only late path timing data to calculate delay, for the clock edge specified.   Note: If the delay type is not specified but the check type is specified as setup, the software will consider the delay type as late. If the check type is hold, the software will consider the delay type as early.  "\fB-edge {rise | fall}  \fR" Specifies the edge of the specified pin for which delay information is to be calculated.  When fall is specified, CCOpt uses only falling clock edge timing data to calculate delay. When rise is specified, CCOpt uses only rising clock edge timing data to calculate delay.  "\fB-exclude_pin_insertion_delays\fR" Specifies that the delay should exclude pin insertion delays.   "\fB-from <pin>\fR" Specifies the pin to query delays from. This means that only paths from the given pin to a sink of the skew group will be considered.   "\fB-longest\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the delay of the longest source-to-sink path within the skew group. This is the default option.  "\fB-path_length {half_perim pin_to_pin_steiner routed}\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will report by the distance from the root measured using the specified distance metric. You can choose to report for any of the following metrics:
.RS  "*" 2 half_perim: The sum of the Manhattan distances between terminals on the path. This is not blockage-aware and is suitable for unbuffered clock trees.  "*" 2 pin_to_pin_steiner: The sum of lengths calculated using a pin-to-pin steiner route. This is blockage-aware and is suitable for unbuffered clock trees.  "*" 2 routed: The sum of pin-to-pin paths calculated on the full steiner for each net. This is blockage-aware but is not suitable for unbuffered clock trees.
.RE   The routed metric is best post-CTS as it measures the actual clock path. The other metrics are good for pre-CTS although they can also be calculated post CTS. For pre-CTS, the half_perim metric is fast to calculate while the other metrics are slow.  Example:  get_ccopt_skew_group_delay -skew_group skew_group:clk/default_constraint_mode -longest -path_length half_perim 1177.8065  get_ccopt_skew_group_delay -skew_group skew_group:clk/default_constraint_mode -longest -path_length half_perim -to pin:nastyclock/flop001/CK 930.0045  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 You can only specify one metric at a time.  "*" 2  You have to specify a skew group and that the length reported will be from the skew group sources to the skew group sinks. This may not cover the entire clock tree. The calculated length will take account of any cells on the clock path, which may increase the path length. The behavior is consistent with delay. The -longest, -shortest, and -skew options work the same. This means that the software looks at all skew group sinks and finds the one with the longest/shortest distance. This sink will not always be the same with the three metrics.  "*" 2 This parameter is mutually exclusive with the -summarize_stage_depth parameter.
.RE   "\fB-real_delays_only     \fR" Specifies that CCOpt only considers real delays in the design. It will not include the virtual delays added by trial CTS to resolve skew constraints.  "\fB-shortest\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the delay of the shortest source-to-sink path within the skew group.  "\fB-skew\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the difference between the shortest and longest source-to-sink delays within the skew group.   "\fB-skew_group <skew_group_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the skew group for which the delay information will be returned. This is a required parameter.   "\fB-summarize_stage_depth <cellTypeList>\fR" Specifies that the command will consider the number of cells of the specified type(s) in the tree, instead of considering delay. Possible values are buffer, inverter,logic, clock_gate, and generator. You can also specify * to include all cell types.  For example, the following command tells you the number of buffers and inverters along the specified path type in the skew group, PM_HL_FUNC.  get_ccopt_skew_group_delay -summarize_stage_depth {buffer inverter} -skew_group m_dsram_clk/PM_HL_FUNC  Note: The * setting is not used in combination with any other cell type. For example, the below is not a valid setting.  -summarize_stage_depth {* buffer}  Note: This parameter is mutually exclusive with the -path_length parameter.  "\fB-through <pin>\fR" Specifies the pin to query delays through. This means that only paths from a source of the given skew group, through this pin, and to a sink of the given skew group, will be considered.   "\fB-to <pin>\fR" Specifies the pin to query delays to. This means that only paths from a source of the given skew group to this pin will be considered.  "\fB-virtual_delays_only  \fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the skew, shortest path delay, or longest path delay only considering the virtual path delays (added by trial balancing) in the design and any user pin insertion delays applied before CTS. It will not include real delays added by clustering buffers and existing cells in the design.  "\fB-wire_delays_only  \fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the skew, shortest path delay, or longest path delay only considering the wire delays in the design. (that is, ignoring cell delays)
