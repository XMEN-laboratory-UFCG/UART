.SH Name \fBclearDrc\fR \-  Clears all design rule checking (DRC) markers in your design
.SH Syntax \fBclearDrc\fR [-help] 
.P Clears all design rule checking (DRC) markers in your design.
.P Note: Do not use the clearDrc command before using ecoRoute or any other routing command. This is because NanoRoute works only on the existing DRC/violation markers. The routing commands will not necessarily perform DRC checks in the routing halo regions if the violation markers are already cleared. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description of the clearDrc command usage.  For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:   man clearDrc
