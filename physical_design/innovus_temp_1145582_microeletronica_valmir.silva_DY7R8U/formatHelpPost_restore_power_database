.SH Name \fBrestore_power_database\fR \-  Restores any power.db file in the Voltus/Innovus session
.SH Syntax  \fBrestore_power_database\fR   [-help]   -file {<file1> <file2> <file3> <...>}   [-hierarchy {<prefix1> <prefix2> <prefix3> <...>}]   [-hierarchy_separator "/"] 
.P Restores any power.db file in the Voltus/Innovus session. This command can be used after restoration of a design to view the static power results or incremental report generation without having to do power analysis again.
.P Note: You will be able to restore the power database that you created previously, only if you created the power database using the  set_power_analysis_mode -create_binary_db true command. Also, the command loads power databases created in the 9.1 release only, and not in the older releases.
.RS  "*" 2 The command can map a hierarchical instance to a flat netlist.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 It can restore multiple power dbs for blocks and top level, that are generated separately.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When the information for a net or an instance is present in multiple power dbs, the last one will overwrite.
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each restore_power_database parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man restore_power_database.  "\fB-file {<file1> <file2> <file3> <...>}\fR" Specifies the name of the power database file.  "\fB-hierarchy {<prefix1> <prefix2> <prefix3> <...>}\fR" Specifies to map each instance in the file with a prefixN/instance (for example, prefixA/inst) in the flat netlist, where '/' is the hierarchy separator.  This is an optional parameter.  Default: all  "\fB-hierarchy_separator "/"\fR" Specifies the separator character in the hierarchical net names, bus names, and pin names for the block or other part of the design that you want to analyze. It must be the same as the separator character in the design netlist.  This is an optional parameter.  Default: slash (/) 
.SH Use Model
.P restoreDesign  restore_power_database -file power.db  report_power # for text based power reports 
.SH Example
.P For each instance in file 'file2' a prefix "A" is added to instance name such as instC, A/instC. No prefix is added to 'file1' since prefix1 is none for file1.
.P restore_power_database -file {file1 file2} -hierarchy {none A}
