.TH report_voltage_swing  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreport_voltage_swing\fR \-  Reports the voltage swings that are shorter than the user-specified thresholds for both clock and data signals
.SH Syntax \fBreport_voltage_swing\fR  [-help]  -high_threshold <float>  -low_threshold <float>  [-output_file <string>]  [-required_width {all | clock}]  [-view <string>] 
.P Reports the voltage swings that are shorter than the user-specified thresholds for both clock and data signals. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description of the report_voltage_swing command. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man report_voltage_swing  "\fB-high_threshold <float>\fR" Specifies the high threshold percentage of the pin supply voltage.  "\fB-low_threshold <float>\fR" Specifies the low threshold percentage of the pin supply voltage.   "\fB-output_file <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file.   "\fB-required_width {all | clock}\fR" Reports the required high and low pulse widths corresponding to the user-specified high and low thresholds. You can specify one of the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 clock: Reports the required widths for all clock pins in the design.  "*" 2 all: Reports the required pulse widths for all input pins in the design.
.RE   Default: all  "\fB-view <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the view being defined.  Note: If this option is not specified, it will dump report for all views.
