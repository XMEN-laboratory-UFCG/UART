.SH Name \fBmark_physical_power_domains\fR \-  Marks the physical power domains that need fences in case the power domains share the same primary supply net and the available supply net setting (if specified). The command also enables the logical domains to exist without any fence
.SH Syntax \fBmark_physical_power_domains\fR  [-help]  {-domains <physical_domain_list> | -reset | -checkOnly}  [-groupPhyLogicalDomains {{<phyPd lpd1 lpd2>
...}
...}] 
.P Marks the physical power domains that need fences in case the power domains share the same primary supply net and the available supply net setting (if specified). The command also enables the logical domains to exist without any fence.
.P Note: mark_physical_power_domains needs to be called again (after the initial use), whenever the tool reads in an power intent file. Else, the file content is not recognized. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage. For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man mark_physical_power_domains  "\fB-checkOnly\fR" Checks the fence sharing against Power/Ground (P/G) nets.  "\fB-domains <physical_domain_list>\fR" Marks listed power domains as physical domains (a physical power domain must have a fence). Once a physical domain is marked, the power domain sharing the same P/G nets (not marked in this command) are recognized as logical domain (or fenceless domain). Therefore, this domain can be implemented without a fence. The instances within logical domain are placed within the fence of its corresponding physical domain. This parameter also executes the-checkOnly parameter, by default.  Note: Default power domain is not required to be marked, it is marked by default. This command needs to be called after each run of commit_power_intent. Otherwise the physical/logical power domain information will be lost in the database.  "\fB-groupPhyLogicalDomains {{<phyPd lpd1 lpd2>
...}
...}\fR" Groups a list of physical and logical domains for the mark_physical_power_domains command.   "\fB-reset\fR" Resets the status marking settings after running commit_power_intent. 
.SH Example
.P The following command marks PDdefault as physical domain:
.P mark_physical_power_domains -domains {PDdefault}
