.SH Name \fBflipchip_allow_routed_bump_edit\fR
.SH Syntax \fBflipchip_allow_routed_bump_edit\fR {0 | 1}  
.P Type: Integer
.P Default: 1
.P Specifies whether the tool should check routing status of bumps before allowing manipulation. By default, the tool ignores routing status and allows manipulation of routed bumps. Manipulation actions include moving, deleting, re-assigning, and swapping. Set this variable to 0 if you want the tool to check routing status of bumps and disallow manipulation of routed bumps.
.P The flipchip_allow_routed_bump_edit variable directly affects dbSetFPlanBox. If this variable is set to 1, a routed bump can be set to a new box (moving action is implemented by changing the object's box). All commands that call dbSetFPlanBox internally are also affected by this variable.
