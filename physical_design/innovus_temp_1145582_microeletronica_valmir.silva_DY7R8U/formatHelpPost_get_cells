.SH Name \fBget_cells\fR \-  Creates a collection of instances in the current design whose name matches the supplied pattern list
.SH Syntax  \fBget_cells\fR  [-help]  [-hierarchical]   [-hsc <char>]  [-filter <expr>]   [-leaf]  [-regexp]   [-nocase]  [-quiet]   [<<patterns>> | -of_objects <<object_list>>] 
.P Creates a collection of instances in the current design whose name matches the supplied pattern list. Assign this collection to a variable or pass it as an argument in another command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression. For any cells that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the cell.  You can filter cells using any of the cell properties supported through the get_propertycommand.  "\fB-hierarchical\fR" Specifies that the patterns should be matched hierarchically. If the flat name of an instance at a particular hierarchical level matches the patterns, it is included in the result. For example. if there is top level hierarchical instance Top and it contains another sub-instance called FF1, then the following command can be used to get the instance Top/FF1 (since the given pattern will be matched with instance flat name FF1):  get_cells -hier FF*  However, the following command will display an error:  get_cells -hier Top/FF*  "\fB-hsc <char>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical delimiter for patterns. For example, if the hierarchical delimiter is @, the sub/I1@I2 pattern matches instance I2 within the hierarchy limited at sub/I1.  "\fB-leaf\fR" Returns leaf cells only.  When the -leaf parameter is not specified, the get_cells command returns the hierarchical instances present on a net along with the flat instances at the same hierarchical level as the specified object.  Note: The -leaf parameter can only be specified with the -of_objects parameter.  "\fB-nocase\fR" Specifies that pattern matching is not case sensitive.  Note: You must specify -regexp in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all cells associated with the specified pins, nets, library cells, or design cells.  You can specify a list of pins or a list of nets, but you cannot specify a list that contains both pins and nets. You can specify patterns for the pin or net names, a collection of pins or nets, or a combination of patterns and a collection.  The -of_objects parameter supports get_designs and get_lib_cells as valid collection objects.  The use model is as follows:  get_cells -of_objects [get_designs <object_list>]  get_cells -of_objects [get_lib_cells <object_list>]  "\fB<patterns>\fR" Specifies patterns for instance names. Patterns include the * and ? wildcard characters and collections of instances.  The get_cells command returns a collection of instances that match the patterns. If no such instance is found, an empty collection is returned.  "\fB-quiet\fR" Suppresses all error and warning messages generated when the get_cells command is run.  "\fB-regexp\fR" Treats the specified patterns as a regular expression patterns.  When this parameter is specified, the given patterns start and end are assumed to be matching with the start and end part of the complete object name.  For example, the following can be used to retrieve the hierarchical instance Top/block1/block2/FF1:  get_cells Top/*/*/FF1  get_cells -regexp Top/.*/FF1  However, the following command will display an error :  get_cells Top/*/FF1  If this parameter is specified with -hier parameter, the given pattern will be matched with the complete hierarchical name of objects instead of only the flat name and all the successful matches are included in the result.  For example, if there is a top level hierarchical instance Top and it contains another sub-instance called FF1, then either of these can be used to retrieve Top/FF1 instance:  get_cells -hier FF1  get_cells -hier -regexp Top/FF1  However, the following commands will display an error :  get_cells -hier Top/FF1  get_cells -hier -regexp FF1
