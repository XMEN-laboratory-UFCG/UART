.SH Syntax \fBtiming_disable_netlist_constants\fR  {true | false}  Default: false 
.P When set to true, ignores constants defined in the Verilog netlist. This includes all uses of the in-place constant notation, such as 1'b0, and the use of power and ground nets. Constants from set_case_analysis assertions and from tie-hi and tie-lo cells are still recognized.
.P When set to false, the software recognizes all constants. 
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
