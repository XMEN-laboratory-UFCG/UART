.SH Name \fBverifyIsolatedCut\fR \-  Checks cuts in all or specified cut layers against the spacing rules set by setIsolatedCutRule
.SH Syntax \fBverifyIsolatedCut\fR  [-help]   [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}]   [-error <integer>]   [-layer {<cutLayer_list>}]   [-maxXY]   [-report <filename>] 
.P Checks cuts in all or specified cut layers against the spacing rules set by setIsolatedCutRule. If you use the -area parameter, checks cuts within the specified area. Reports violations in the log file and in verify.isoVia.rpt or the specified report file.
.P Note: Violations can be viewed in the Violation Browser. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyIsolatedCut parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man verifyIsolatedCut  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}   \fR" Specifies the coordinates of the area to verify. If you do not specify this parameter, the command checks the whole design. For example, verifyIsolatedCut -area {0 0 100 100}.  Default: Entire area  "\fB-error <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of errors to report.  Default: 1000  "\fB-layer {<cutLayer_List>}  \fR" Specifies the cut layers to be checked. If you specify only one layer name, you do not need the braces around the name. For example, verifyIsolatedCut -layer {Via1 Via2}.  Default: All cut layers  "\fB-maxXY\fR" Specifies that the Square metric should be used for checking isolated cuts. By this metric, another cut should exist within a square window from a certain cut. The size of the square window depends on the spacing rules set by setIsolatedCutRule.  Note: If this parameter is not specified, the Euclidean metric is used for checking isolated cuts.  "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the report file for the isolated cut violation information.  Default: verify.isoVia.rpt 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks isolated cuts on all layers and generates a report file named test.isoCut.rpt:  verifyIsolatedCut -report test.isoCut.rpt
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command checks for isolated cuts in the area specified and generates a report named verify_isoVia.rpt:   verifyIsolatedCut -area {0 0 1600 1600}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2  The following set of commands check for isolated cuts on all layers using the Square metric. Any cut that does not have another cut within a 25um x 25um square window is reported:> setIsolatedCutRule -spacing 25> verifyIsolatedCut -maxXY  In the following pattern, no isolated cut violation is reported as each cut has one or more cuts within a 25um x 25um square window.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  In contrast, the following pattern is not okay because no other cut exists within a 25um x 25um square window:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
