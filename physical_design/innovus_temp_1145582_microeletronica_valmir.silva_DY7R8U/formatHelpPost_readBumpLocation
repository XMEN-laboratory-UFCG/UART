.P The command creates or assigns objects on the current die according to the bumps on the adjacent die. In a TSV design, the micro bumps on the adjacent die should be aligned, and the aligned micro bumps should be with the same signal. Specify this command to sync-up the micro bump between dies. Firstly, the command tries to find the front side bump/back side bump/TSV at the location aligned to the bump on the adjacent dies. If all the specified bumps/TSVs are found on the current die, the command will assign the found bump/TSV with the same signal as the bump on the adjacent die; if none of the specified bumps/TSV are found, the command will create the specified bump/TSV with the same signal at the aligned position.
.P This command supports the combo bump and embedded bump flows.
.P Use this command after reading the stacked die config file (XML), by using readTSVConfig, as the die configuration is required for the bump alignment.
.P The command also checks for dummy bump overlaps by default. It checks overlaps between:
.RS  "*" 2 Dummy bumps by checking the OBS overlap.  "*" 2 Dummy bump and bump by checking the OBS and bump pin overlap.
.RE
.P In case there is dummy bump overlaps, the tool gives a warning message.
.P Note: A combo bump is a group of bumps that are treated as one bump, which means all bumps in the same combo bump will be created, assigned, unassigned, and manipulated at the same time. This command synchronizes the combo bump information between adjacent chips automatically. All bumps belonging to the same combo bump will be treated as one unit. Embedded bump is the bump at the block-level, and the information of these bumps can be exchanged between chips at the top-level.   
.SH Parameters   "\fB-allow_overlap_control {keep_all keep_existing_bumps keep_new_bumps}\fR" Specifies the overlap control type. The allowed values for the -allow_overlap_control parameter are:
.RS  "*" 2 keep_all: Keeps all overlapping bumps.  "*" 2 keep_existing_bumps: Keeps the existing bumps before calling readBumpLocation if there is an overlap. If this option is specified, readBumpLocation keeps creating a bump if there is an overlap and continues creating the remaining bumps. A warning message is displayed when bump creation is skipped to avoid overlap.  "*" 2 keep_new_bumps: Removes the existing bumps before calling readBumpLocation, places the newly created bump if there is overlap, and then continues creating the remaining bumps. A warning message is displayed when deleting the existing bumps to avoid overlap. If the status of the existing bumps to be deleted is covered or fixed, a warning is displayed and the new bumps overlapping with the covered or fixed old bump are not kept.
.RE   "\fB-backBump <bumpCellName>\fR" Creates or assigns the backside bumps at the location aligned with the bumps on the adjacent die.   "\fB-checkAlignment\fR" Use this parameter to check the alignment between current die and the adjacent dies. It also checks the overlap between the OBS layer and bumps (both front and back bumps).  When this parameter is specified, all other parameters are ineffective.  "\fB-bump_cell_from_bump_file \fR" Creates bumps with the same bump cell defined in the bump file.   "\fB-bump_name_from_bump_file {true | false}\fR" Creates bumps with the same bump name defined in bump file.    "\fB-die_box\fR" Draws the die bounding box based on the DieBox value in the bump file.  "\fB-force_current_die\fR" Specifies to consider the bump file as the current die bump file. Skip to check if the specified bump file is for current die or adjacent die or a block.   "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the bump location file of the adjacent die.   "\fB-frontBump <bumpCellName>\fR" Creates or assigns the frontside bumps at the location aligned with the bumps on the adjacent die.  "\fB-feedthru\fR" Creates or assigns the bump with feedthru net only. If -feedthruSize and -tsvViaName are specified, the TSV and the stacked via of the feedthru will also be created.  "\fB-feedthruSize <sizex sizey>\fR" Specifies the size for feedthru. This option is exclusive with the -nonFeedthru option.  "\fB-ignore_route_blockages\fR" Allows creation of bumps on route blockages. When this option is specified, the tool ignores checking route blockages when creating bumps.   "\fB-nonFeedthru\fR" Creates or assigns the bump with normal net only.  "\fB-offset x y\fR" Specifies the offset from the TSV to the corresponding bump.  Note: You can also specify the offset in the bump file by appending -offset x y to the line.  The offset in the bump file has higher priority than the offset specified in the command line. If -offset is specified at both command line and bump file, the program will follow the offset specified in the bump file.  "\fB-prefix <prefixName>\fR" Adds prefix name for a bump during bump creation and bump mapping.  The default name of bumps are frontBump_* or backBump_* with serial numbers.  If -prefix <prefixName> is applied, created bump names are prefixName_frontBump_* or prefixName_backBump_*.  Note: Single underscore (_) is automatically added between the <prefixName> and the default bump name.  "\fB-rotate_bump\fR" Rotates bumps during bump mapping according to the chip and bump orientation information of the adjacent die.   "\fB-stackViaUnderBump <stackViaName>\fR" Specifies the stack via name under the front bump.  The tool automatically adds the specified via cell stacking to the bottom layer of front-side bump.  "\fB-tsvViaName <viaCellName>\fR" Creates or assigns the TSV at the location aligned (or with offset if -offset is specified) to the bumps on the adjacent die.
.P Note: If neither -feedthru nor -nonFeedthru is specified, the bump/TSV with both feedthru net and non-feedthru net will be created and assigned.
