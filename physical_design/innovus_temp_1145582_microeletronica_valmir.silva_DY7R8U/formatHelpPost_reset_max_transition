.TH reset_max_transition  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreset_max_transition\fR
.SH Syntax \fBreset_max_transition\fR  <object_list> 
.P Resets the maximum slew (transition) limit specified using the set_max_transition command (from the SDC or the Tempus command line) on the objects in the given object list. The valid objects in the object list are primary ports, clocks, and current design.
.P The maximum transition limit that is set by the user overrides the dotlib value so that sharper slews are implemented on the timing sensitive nets, such as clocks. A violation due to the set_max_transition setting does not impact the timing accuracy.
.P Note: For command-line usage of this command, you need to use set_interactive_constraint_modes, for example,  set_interactive_constraint_modes [all_constraint_modes -active] 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the list (or collection) of ports, modules, and/or clock waveforms for which assertions are to be reset. For example, reset_max_transition [get_ports *]
