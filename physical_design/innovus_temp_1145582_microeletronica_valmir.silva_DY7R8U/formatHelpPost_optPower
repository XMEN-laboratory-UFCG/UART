.SH Name \fBoptPower\fR \-  Optimizes the power consumption of the design by swapping gates for those with lower power, or deleting buffers/inverters without degrading timing. This works in conjunction with the setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio command to determine the type of optimization being performed -  leakage, dynamic, or a combination of both

.P Optimizes the power consumption of the design by swapping gates for those with lower power, or deleting buffers/inverters without degrading timing. This works in conjunction with the setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio command to determine the type of optimization being performed -  leakage, dynamic, or a combination of both.
.P Since the default for setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio parameter is 1.0, optPower will perform leakage optimization only by default using LEF-safe optimization (if no other switch is set). It is vital to set up the design correctly before starting power optimization. For more information, see the Optimizing Power During optDesign section of the Optimizing Timing chapter in the Innovus User Guide.
.P The setup steps include the following:
.RS  "*" 2 Setting the correct power views for both leakage and dynamic optimization  "*" 2 Ensuring that the libraries contain cell_leakage_power information  "*" 2 Ensuring that the switching activity has been correctly specified either through read_activity_file -format { VCD | TCF | SAF } file_name or the set_default_switching_activity command

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each optPower parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man optPower.  "\fB-allowResizing\fR" Specifies that optimization uses resizing for power reclaim and, if needed, for recovery. Since the cells will be of different physical footprint, placement refinement and routing ECO will be used. The DRV and timing recovery steps will also be performed, as required. These extra steps will result in an increase in runtime. As this is a more aggressive optimization, the power savings should be superior to the default optPower values, but this may cause timing degradations in some cases. When this parameter is set, the  setOptMode -opt_post_route_check_antenna_rules true setting will be ignored and the software will give a warning to that effect.   "\fB-effortLevel {high}\fR" Specifies the effort level as high. When this parameter is specified, power optimization uses aggressive reclaim. The software performs a timing recovery step and there is a large increase in runtime on an average as compared to when regular power optimization is performed.   "\fB-force\fR" Resizes each instance to a cell with the lowest leakage power, disregarding design rule violations and optimum timing. This only works when setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio is set to 1.0.  "\fB-preCts\fR" Performs power optimization on the placed design, before the clock trees are created.  "\fB-postCts\fR" Performs power optimization on a design whose clock trees have already been created.  "\fB-prePlace\fR" When specified, performs power optimization on an unplaced design. This parameter must be used with the -force parameter.  "\fB-postRoute\fR" Performs power optimization on a design whose routing is complete.   "\fB-seqOnly\fR" Specifies that dynamic power optimization should be done on sequential cells only. This option works with the -force parameter in all modes; preCts, prePlace, postCts, and postRoute. 
.SH  Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following commands to optimize the design targeting total power at the preCts stage:  setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio 0.5   optPower -preCts   "*" 2 Use the following command to optimize the design, targeting leakage power only at the postCts stage (assuming that setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio has been untouched or has been set to the default value of 1.0):  optPower -postCts   "*" 2 Use the following commands to optimize dynamic power only at the postRoute stage:  setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio 0.0  optPower -postRoute   "*" 2 Use the following commands to perform resizing for total power optimization in the design at the preCts stage:   setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio 0.5   optPower -preCts -allowResizing
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following commands to perform aggressive dynamic power optimization in the design at the postCts stage:   setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio 0.0   optPower -postCts -effortLevel high   "*" 2 Use the following commands to optimize leakage power by forcing all cells to their lowest leakage equivalent, disregarding DRV and timing degradations at the preCts stage:   setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio 1.0  optPower -preCts -force   "*" 2 Use the following commands to optimize dynamic power by swapping sequential cells only in the design at the preCts stage:   setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio 0.0  optPower -preCts -seqOnly   "*" 2 Use the following commands to allow the tool to swap gates, including the gates with negative slack, up to the current negative slack at the postRoute stage:   setOptMode -opt_setup_target_slack <current_negative_slack>   optPower -postRoute   "*" 2 To prevent power optimization from working on near critical paths, you can set a different target to that of the timing optimization. A typical example is shown below where power optimization will not work on paths less than 0.1ns but the target for timing will remain 0.0 :   setOptMode -opt_setup_target_slack 0.0   setOptMode -opt_area_recovery_setup_target_slack 0.1  setOptMode -opt_leakage_to_dynamic_ratio 0.5   optPower -preCts
