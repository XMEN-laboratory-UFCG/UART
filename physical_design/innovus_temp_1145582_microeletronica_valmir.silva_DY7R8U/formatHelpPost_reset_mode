.TH reset_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreset_mode\fR \-  Resets the Liberty timing library modes for a specified instance
.SH Syntax \fBreset_mode\fR  [-type cell]   <list_of_modes>  <object_list> 
.P Resets the Liberty timing library modes for a specified instance.
.P Library modes are set using the set_mode command. By default, all library modes in the timing library are active. If you specify one or more library modes using the set_mode command, only the timing arcs consistent with the specified mode(s) are active for the instance. All other library modes become inactive. When you reset the library mode for the instance, all library modes become active again. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the instances to which to reset the library modes.  "\fB<list_of_modes>\fR" Specifies the name of the library modes to reset.  "\fB-type cell\fR" Resets the library mode at the instance level.  Note: Setting the library mode at the instance level is the only form of set_mode that is currently supported. This parameter exists to support constraints coming from external sources. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies that only the timing arcs consistent with the test_A library mode are active for instances of b1:  The test_A library mode is made inactive.  set_mode test_mode [get_cells BUF]  The following command reports the status of all library modes associated with BUF 'b1'
. It shows that test_A is active and test_B is inactive.  > report_mode b1  -------------------------------  Mode Group test_mode of b1  -------------------------------  Mode     Status    Condition  Name  -------------------------------  test_B   Inactive  !(Y)  test_A   ACTIVE    Y  -------------------------------  The following command resets the library mode for instances of b1 :  reset_mode test_A b1  If you generate a report of the library mode status for b1, it shows that both modes are now active:  > report_mode b1  -----------------------------  Mode Group test_mode of b1  -----------------------------  Mode    Status   Condition  Name  -----------------------------  test_B  ACTIVE    !(Y)  test_A  ACTIVE    Y  -----------------------------
