.SH Name \fBtiming_disable_timing_model_latch_inferencing\fR \-  Controls whether latch behavior is inferred for cell descriptions tagged with the Liberty timing_model_type attribute, including all values: abstracted, extracted, or qtm
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_disable_timing_model_latch_inferencing\fR  {true | false}   Default: true 
.P Controls whether latch behavior is inferred for cell descriptions tagged with the Liberty timing_model_type attribute, including all values: abstracted, extracted, or qtm. 
.P When set to false, the software infers latch behavior from the timing check and timing delay arc relationships in the model's description.
.P When set to true, latch inferencing does not happen for cells with the timing_model_type attribute. Explicit Liberty latch modelling constructs must be coded into the description in order to model latch behavior. 
.P This global does not affect Liberty timing model cells that do not contain the timing_model_type attribute. Standard cell core libraries generally do not have this attribute specified; therefore, they typically are not be affected by this global setting.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
