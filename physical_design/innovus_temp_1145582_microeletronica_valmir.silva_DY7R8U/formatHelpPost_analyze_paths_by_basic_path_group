.SH Name \fBanalyze_paths_by_basic_path_group\fR \-  Categorizes the timing paths based on basic path groups
.SH Syntax  \fBanalyze_paths_by_basic_path_group\fR  [-help]  [-master <master_category_name>]  [-predefined]  
.P Categorizes the timing paths based on basic path groups. The basic path groups are fundamental to timing analysis and help the user in observing the timing information of different basic path groups easily. For instance, if user is only concerned about the paths from registers to registers, the user can analyze the paths in the category REG -> REG. The basic path groups categories are:
.RS  "*" 2 Register to register  "*" 2 Input to register  "*" 2 Register to output  "*" 2 Input to output
.RE
.P The following categories are created:
.RS  "*" 2 REG->REG  "*" 2 IN->REG  "*" 2 REG->OUT  "*" 2 IN->OUT
.RE
.P Timing debug can also convert user defined path groups into path categories. The command can be applied wherever the user loads the machine readable timing report.
.P Note: If your design does not have paths belonging to a type of path group, the software will not create that category.
.P For more information on creating path categories, see "Creating Path Categories" in the Debugging Timing Results chapter of User Guide. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each analyze_paths_by_basic_path_group parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man analyze_paths_by_basic_path_group  "\fB-master <master_category_name>\fR" Specifies that the analysis should be performed only for the specified master category.  "\fB-predefined \fR" Creates path categories for user defined path groups. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command create path categories based on basic path groups:   analyze_paths_by_basic_path_group  The following categories are created: REG->REG, IN->REG, REG->OUT, IN->OUT.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command create path categories based on predefined path group "critical" :   group_path -name critical -from {ff*/CLK } -to {ff*/D} #create predefined path group  analyze_paths_by_basic_path_group -predefined  The category "critical" will be created based on the predefined path group name.
