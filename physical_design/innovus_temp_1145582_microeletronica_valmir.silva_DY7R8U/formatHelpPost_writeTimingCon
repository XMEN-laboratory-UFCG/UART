.SH Name \fBwriteTimingCon\fR \-  Generates the timing constraints file in Design Compiler format
.SH Syntax \fBwriteTimingCon\fR  [-help]  [-view <viewname>]   [-exclude_annotated {delays | checks | transitions}]  <[filename]> 
.P Generates the timing constraints file in Design Compiler format. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-exclude_annotated {delays | checks | transitions}\fR" Disables listing of annotated constraints.
.RS  "*" 2 delays: Suppresses dumping of set_annotated_delay constraints.  "*" 2 checks: Suppresses dumping of set_annotated_check constraints.  "*" 2 transitions: Suppresses dumping of set_annotated_transition constraints.
.RE   "\fB<filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the constraints file. By default, the constraint file is generated in the current directory. To save to a different directory, you need to specify the complete path.  "\fB-view <viewname>\fR" Specifies a view name to obtain the desired SDC. 
.SH Command Order
.P Use this command after reading in a timing constraints file. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates constraints file newc and saves the generated file in the directory new:   writeTimingCon new/newc
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Specifying the following constraints will have new entries in the output constraints file:   set_annotated_delay -from u1/A -to u1/Y -cell 2  set_annotated_check 2 -setup -from f0/CK -to f0/D  The output constraint file constr.pt will have the following new entries:   set_annotated_delay -cell 2 -from [get_pins {u1/A}] -to [get_pins {u1/Y}]  set_annotated_check -setup -from [get_pins {f0/CK}] -to [get_pins {f0/D}] 2
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 For the following constraints in the design :   set_annotated_delay -from u1/A -to u1/Y -cell 2  set_annotated_transition 2 u1/A  set_annotated_check 2 -setup -from f0/CK -to f0/D  The output constraint file constr.pt will have the following entries :   set_annotated_transition 2 [get_pins {u1/A}]  set_annotated_check -setup -from [get_pins {f0/CK}] -to [get_pins {f0/D}] 2  set_annotated_check -setup -from [get_pins {f0/CK}] -to [get_pins {f0/D}] 2
