.SH Name \fBgenerateRCFactor\fR \-  Generates the resistance and capacitance scale factors for optimal RC correlation by comparing the SPEF files generated by native extraction either with the user-specified reference RC data or with the automatic running of extraction in the higher accuracy mode
.SH Syntax \fBgenerateRCFactor\fR  [-help]  [-outputFile <file_name>]  [-preroute { true | false}]   [-postroute { low | medium }]   [-reference {low | medium | high | signoff | externalSpef}]   [-spefMapFile <file_name>]  [-use_ostrich_filters <file_name>]  
.P Generates the resistance and capacitance scale factors for optimal RC correlation by comparing the SPEF files generated by native extraction either with the user-specified reference RC data or with the automatic running of extraction in the higher accuracy mode. After generating the scale factors, the command prints a summary of the scale factors to a file. You can use this file to set the actual scale factors.
.P This command allows you to generate scale factors for one engine or multiple engines, depending on the parameters you specify. You can run preRoute (-preroute), or postRoute (-postroute) or both types of extraction to generate scale factors. For postRoute extraction, you can run extraction with effortLevel low or with effortLevel low and medium. The reference for comparison can be either an external SPEF or a SPEF generated from the postRoute extraction engine with the specified effortLevel.
.P When using an external SPEF as reference, use the -spefMapFile parameter to specify the name of a file containing multiple SPEF files for use in an MMMC setup.
.P Note: A Standalone Quantus extraction licence is required to run sign-off extraction in this command. Specify the Quantus path in the path setup. If you do not have a Standalone Quantus extraction license, you can use the -spefMapFile parameter to specify the signoff SPEF file(s). In addition, a proper setup of Quantus technology file(s) is required when specifying -reference medium, high or signoff. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for the generateRCFactor parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man generateRCFactor.  "\fB-outputFile <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the file in which the command will save the new RC factor setting. You can use this file to set the actual scale factors.   "\fB-preroute {true | false}\fR" Generates the scale factor for preroute extraction. When set to true, generates optimal scale factors for both signal nets and clock nets for preroute extraction.  Default: true  "\fB-postroute {low | medium}\fR" Specifies whether scale factors are to be generated for postRoute extraction. It also specifies whether scale factors are to be generated for engine with effortLevel low only, or for both engines with effortLevel low and medium.  If the -postroute parameter is not specified, scale factors are not generated for postRoute extraction.  When you use the -postroute low parameter, the software generates different scale factors for signal nets and clock nets.  "\fB-reference {low | medium | high | signoff | externalSpef}\fR" Specifies the postRoute engine or external SPEF that you want to use as reference for comparison.  Default: signoff  If you specify externalSpef, you should use the -spefMapFile parameter to specify the third party SPEF file(s) to be used for comparison.  "\fB-spefMapFile <file_name>\fR" Specifies the SPEF map file to be used for comparison when using MMMC designs. When you use this parameter, the design must be placed and fully routed, and the referenced SPEF file must be the one generated from the same routed design.  The map file has a list of RC corners and the corresponding SPEF file for each RC corner, as shown in the following example:  rcmin design_rcmin.spef  rcmax design_rcmax.spef  "\fB-use_ostrich_filters file_name\fR" Specifies the filename containing user-specified ostrich filter values for Tcap, res, and Xcap. These user-specified values are applied during the Ostrich run.  In case this parameter is not specified by the user, default ostrich filter values will be used.  The format of the file to be specified by the users for ostrich filters is:  -tcap {-min_data <value> -max_data <value> -min_fanout  <value> -max_fanout <value> -max_perc_dev <value>}  -res {-min_data <value> -max_data <value> -min_fanout <value>  -max_fanout <value> -max_perc_dev <value>}  -xcap {-min_data <value> -max_data <value> -min_fanout  <value> -max_fanout <value> -max_perc_dev <value>}

.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates scale factors for preroute and postroute -effortLevel low engines in an MMMC design by comparing the parasitics with an external supplied list of SPEF files:   generateRCFactor -preroute true -postroute low -reference externalSpef -spefMapFile preRoute_mapFile  In this example, the SPEF files specified in the file referenced in the -spefMapFile parameter must be generated using a postroute extraction tool on the same routed design.
