.SH Name \fBselectRouteBlk\fR
.SH Syntax \fBselectRouteBlk\fR   [-help]  [-box <llx lly urx ury>]   name   [-layer <layerId> | <layerIdlist
...>]
.P Selects the routing blockages based on the following specifications:
.RS  "*" 2 The coordinates of the bounding box  "*" 2 The name of the blockage  "*" 2 The layer(s) or the via(s). The command supports selection on multiple layers and/or vias.
.RE
.P If you don't specify the box coordinates, [llx lly urx ury], the command selects the first routing blockage by name and layer.
.P Use this command during partition floorplanning. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-box <llx lly urx ury>\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the blockage area.
.RS  "*" 2 <llx>: Specifies the lower left x coordinate of the blockage box.  "*" 2 lly: Specifies the lower left y coordinate of the blockage box.  "*" 2 urx: Specifies the lower right x coordinate of the blockage box.  "*" 2 ury: Specifies the lower right y coordinate of the blockage box.
.RE   Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each selectRouteBlk parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man selectRouteBlk.  "\fB-layer <layerId> | <layerIdlist
..>.\fR" Specifies the layer(s) and/or via(s). For layer names, specify the number. For example 3.  For via names specify the lowercase character v followed by the via number. For example, v3.  Note: The -layer parameter supports masterslice layers with type REGION.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the routing blockage. All the routing blockages with the specified name get selected.   You can use wildcards (* or ?) for specifying the names of routing blockages.  Data_type: string, required 
.SH Examples

.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command selects the routing blockages with names blk1, blk2, and so on.   selectRouteBlk blk*
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command selects the routing blockage blk1 that lies in the bounding box with the coordinates 17, 223, 1117, and 1223.   The commands selects the routing blockage on layer 1 and layer 2.  selectRouteBlk -box 17 223 1117 1223 blk1 -layer 1 2
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command selects the routing blockage blk1 on layer 3 and 4.  selectRouteBlk blk1 -layer 3 4
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command selects the routing blockage blk2 that lies in the bounding box with the coordinates 17, 223, 1117, and 1223.   The commands selects the routing blockage on layer1 and via 2.  selectRouteBlk -box 17 223 1117 1223 blk2 -layer 1 v2
