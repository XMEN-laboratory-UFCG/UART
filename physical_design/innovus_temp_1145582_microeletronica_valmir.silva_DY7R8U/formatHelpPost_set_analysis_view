.SH Name \fBset_analysis_view\fR \-  Defines the analysis views to use for setup and hold analysis and optimization.You must define at least one setup and one hold analysis view. The "active" views represent the different design variations that will be analyzed
.SH Syntax \fBset_analysis_view\fR  [-help]  [-drv <string>]  [-dynamic <string>]  -hold <list_of_views>  [-inactive <string>]  [-leakage <string>]  -setup <list_of_views>  [-update_timing] 
.P Defines the analysis views to use for setup and hold analysis and optimization.You must define at least one setup and one hold analysis view. The "active" views represent the different design variations that will be analyzed. These views can be changed throughout the flow to utilize different subsets of views. The libraries and data are loaded into the system that are required to support the selected set of active views. 
.P When the set_analysis_view command is issued, it will cause a full timing reset. During a timing reset, all the interconnect parasitics, delays, and timing slacks will be recalculated.
.P The order in which you specify the views with the -setup and -hold parameters is important. By default, the first views defined in the -setup and -hold lists are the default views. The default views serve two purposes:
.RS  "*" 2 Provide the library data that is used during the design initialization process.  "*" 2 Indicate to parts of the application, that are not MMMC-aware, which view's information to use for a particular analysis step (in most cases, the default view is the first setup or hold view). You can use the set_default_view command to change the default view to any currently active view without incurring a timing reset. This control is not frequently used since most applications either support MMMC or provide a direct control for selecting the appropriate view to use for that specific analysis.
.RE
.P Using the set_default_view command does not affect software performance because it only uses views that are already active in the design. If you use the set_analysis_view command to change the default views, the existing timing and delay calculation data is reset.
.P Use this command after creating multiple analysis views (create_analysis_view).
.P Note: The set_analysis_view command does not work in an incremental manner for setting parameters. Each invocation of this command must include the full specification of all the active views required for analysis. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-drv <string>\fR" Allows you to set DRV views.   "\fB-dynamic <string>\fR" Sets a view as a dynamic view.  Delay calculation is required to provide transition times. Delay calculation should not perform SI analysis if the delay corner is only required for the dynamic power. The timer is not required to propagate required times or perform slack computations.  "\fB-hold <list_of_views>\fR" Sets the active views for hold analysis.  "\fB-inactive <string>\fR" Sets views as inactive for timing analysis.   "\fB-leakage <string>\fR" Sets a view as a leakage view.  The Timing libraries must be loaded, if not already in use. The Timer constant propagation is required, whereas delay calculation is not required.  "\fB-setup <list_of_views>\fR" Sets the active views for setup analysis.  "\fB-update_timing\fR" Reloads the configuration described by the MMMC view and mode objects. When the timing global timing_defer_mmmc_object_updates is set to true, this parameter is required to update the MMMC timing environment.  The -update_timing parameter may be specified without any -setup or -hold arguments. In this case, the data associated with the current set of setup and/or hold views will be loaded. If no active setup or hold views exist, then using this parameter alone may display an error.  The -update_timing parameter may also be used in conjunction with the -setup and -hold options. In this case, the newly specified setup/hold view configuration will be loaded with the updated MMMC object information.
.P When you issue the set_analysis_view command, the software will perform a timing reset, so that only the new active view information is loaded up. The software requires the -setup and -hold view parameters to be explicitly specified for each set_analysis_view command run. If these parameters are not specified, the software issues an error message. Any optional settings, such as, -leakage or -dynamic views will be reset if they are not specified with the new set_analysis_view command.
.P Note: It is recommended to use the same power view for both leakage and dynamic, that is, both the -dynamic and -leakage parameters should have the same user-specified view settings. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets missionWCCOM and mission2WCCOM as the active views for setup analysis, and missionBCCOM and testBCCOM as the active views for hold analysis:   set_analysis_view -setup {missionWCCOM mission2WCCOM}      -hold {missionBCCOM testBCCOM}
