.SH Syntax \fBecoCloneFlop\fR  [-help]   [-force]  -instances <flopInstName>  [-max_num_loads <num_of_loads>]  [-numClones <number>]  [-radius <num_of_rows>]  [-verbose] 
.P Clones flop instances as long as the flops meet the following criteria:
.RS  "*" 2 They are not FIXED  "*" 2 They are allowed to be resized  "*" 2 When they do not share synchronization signals with some other instance
.RE
.P This command is used when you want to clone a flop as manual ECO. Manual flop cloning is usually performed on control signal flip-flops, when the output needs to reach sections of the floorplan that are spread out. Cloning the flip-flops allows you to place each clone close to its sink points, thereby reducing the timing closure effort.
.P This command should not be used to clone a flop that drives a clock net, which is a net with the attribute isDefInclock, because this may lead to problems during optimization or timing. The default behavior of the command may reject the flip-flop cloning due to design constraints or QOR impact.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ecoCloneFlop parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man ecoCloneFlop  "\fB-force\fR" When specified, forces the flop instance to clone. This parameter is used when flop cloning is rejected by the software.   "\fB-instances <flopInstName>\fR" Specifies the list of instances to be cloned. This is a required parameter.   "\fB-max_num_loads <num_of_loads>\fR" Specifies that cloning should be skipped for instances driving more than the specified number of loads.  Default: 50000  "\fB-numClones <number>\fR" Specifies the cloned numbers for the flop instance.   "\fB-radius <num_of_rows>\fR" Specifies that the clones should be placed within a radius of the specified number of rows from their preferred location based on the original instance location and the center of mass of the new set of loads.  Default: 10  "\fB-verbose\fR" When specified, verbose messages are displayed during the cloning of flop instances. 
.SH Example
.P The following command will clone the flip-flop $inst 3 times:
.P ecoCloneFlop -instances $inst -numClones 3
