.SH Name \fBsetWhatIfDriveType\fR \-  Sets the output and bidirectional ports that have the specified type of cell within the blackbox or blackblob as drivers on the interface nets
.SH Syntax  \fBsetWhatIfDriveType\fR  <blackBoxCellName>  [-port <outputPortName>]   [-lib <libName>]   -cell <cellName>  [-slew <value> [-outputCap <value>]]   [-inputPin <libraryInputPin>]  [-outputPin <libraryOutputPin>]  
.P Sets the output and bidirectional ports that have the specified type of cell within the blackbox or blackblob as drivers on the interface nets. You can not specify two different drivers for two timing arcs ending at the same output port. The software stores the drive type specification, and uses it to create a timing arc after you specify the delay.
.P You can use this command after the module definition of the blackbox or the blackblob is available with the I/O's in the Verilog netlist.
.P Note: The timing sense of the driver is taken into account in the combinatorial what-if timing arc description--while applying the drive type, the timing sense of the combinatorial arc is replaced by the timing sense of the driver's timing arc. For sequential arcs, the timing sense is always set to non_unate. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<blackBoxCellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the blackbox or blackblob cell.  "\fB-cell <cellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the cell. If there are two cells with the same name, the software uses the first one found.  You can specify a complex cell (with multiple inputs and/or outputs) with this parameter.  "\fB-lib <libName>\fR" Specifies the name of the timing library.  "\fB-outputCap <value>\fR" The value for this parameter is set as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 If the value of the -context parameter of the  setWhatIfTimingModesetWhatIfTimingModeis set to in, the output capacitance value is equal to the real capacitance. The   -outputCap parameter of the setWhatIfDriveType command is not applicable in this case.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If the value of the -context parameter of the setWhatIfTimingMode is set to out:
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 If the -outputCap parameter is specified with the setWhatIfDriveType command, the output capacitance is set to this value.
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 If the -outputCap parameter is not specified with the setWhatIfDriveType command, the outputCap value as specified with the -outputCap parameter of the setWhatIfTimingMode is used as the output capacitance for the setWhatIfDriveType command.
.RE 
.RE    Note: You cannot use this parameter in the intrinsic timing model mode.   "\fB-port <outputPortName>\fR" Specifies the name of the output port. If you do not specify a port name, the software sets all output and bidirectional ports as drivers on the interface nets. Each time you modify the driver on an output port of the blackbox or blackblob, the software recalculates all timing arcs attached to the output port with the new driver specification.  "\fB-slew <value>\fR" Specifies the slew at the input of the driver cell. If you specify the slew value, the software creates a one-dimensional timing table depending on the output capacitance.   If you do not specify the slew value, the software creates a two-dimensional timing table with input slew and output capacitance values. In this case, the software assumes that there is no slew variation between the input port of the blackbox or blackblob, and the driver input pin.   You must use this parameter in the normalized timing model mode. This parameter is not available in the intrinsic timing model mode  "\fB-inputPin <LibraryInputPin>\fR" Specifies the input or inout pin of the cell (specified by the -cell parameter) whose source arcs will be used for setting the drive type on the port.  Default: If this parameter is not specified, the software selects an input or inout pin automatically.  "\fB-outputPin <LibraryOutputPin>\fR" Specifies the output or inout pin of the library whose source arcs will be used for setting the drive type on the port.  Default: If this parameter is not specified, the software selects an output or inout pin automatically.
