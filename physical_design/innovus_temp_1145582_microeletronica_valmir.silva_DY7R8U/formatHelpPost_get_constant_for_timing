.SH Name \fBget_constant_for_timing\fR \-  Queries the design database for the state of the specified pin or the state propagated through the combinational logic cone to that pin
.SH Syntax  \fBget_constant_for_timing\fR   [-bidi_input | -bidi_output]   <pin_name> 
.P Queries the design database for the state of the specified pin or the state propagated through the combinational logic cone to that pin. The returned value is 0 for logic 0, 1 for logic 1, X for undefined, and Z for tristate.
.P Note: Constants on hierarchical ports are not computed.
.P The get_constant_for_timing command returns the state for one pin only. If you want to know the state on all ports that have a constant set, use the -type constant option with the report_ports command. For example:  report_ports -type constant.Use the -tcl_list option to process the list in Tcl.
.P See report_net examples for an example of the -tcl_list output.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-bidi_input | -bidi_output\fR" Returns the constant that is set on the input or output part of bidirectional pins.  Default: Returns the constant on the output part.  "\fB<pin_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the single pin to query for pin state. The pin must be an instance pin or primary I/O port. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the value of the specified pin(s) to either a 1 or 0 for use by the timing engine: set_case_analysis 0 J_block/zbuf0/A
