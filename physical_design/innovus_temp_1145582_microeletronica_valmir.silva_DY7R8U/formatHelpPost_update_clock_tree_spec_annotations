.TH update_clock_tree_spec_annotations  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBupdate_clock_tree_spec_annotations\fR \-  Updates all ideal nets, transition and delay annotations to match active timing constraints and removes all prior annotations from the clock tree specification
.SH Syntax \fBupdate_clock_tree_spec_annotations\fR  [-help]  [-file <file_name>] 
.P Updates all ideal nets, transition and delay annotations to match active timing constraints and removes all prior annotations from the clock tree specification. When this command is specified, all prior annotations are removed from the clock tree specification and the set_annotated_transition and set_annotated_delay values are mapped to the annotated_transition and annotated_delay_to property settings. The updated settings can be written to a file using the -file option or they can be applied immediately.
.P The following properties are provided to model the data captured by set_ideal_network, set_annotated_delay, set_annotated_transition, set_ideal_latency and set_ideal_transition:
.RS  "*" 2 
.SH ideal_net  If set the clock tree timing engine will consider this net as ideal.  Default: false  Required argument: net  "*" 2 
.SH annotated_delay_to  Overrides any clock tree timing engine-computed cell arc or net arc delays to the specified pin, in a manner similar to that of SDC set_annotated_delay command.  For cell arcs: The format is dict where the keys are pins and the values are a rise fall delay pair. For example:  "<from pin 1> {<from rise delay 1> <from fall delay 1>} <from pin 2> {<from rise delay 1> <from fall delay 2>}"  For net arcs: The format is dict where the keys are pins and the values are the delay. For example:  "<from pin 1> <delay 1> <from pin 2> <delay 2>}"  For convenience, set the property using a single value that will apply to all available delays from pins and rise/fall from edges. For example, "0.100".  Default: ""  Applicable arguments: "-delay_corner <name>", "-pin <name>", "-early", "-late", "-rise" and "-fall". Required: "-pin <name>".  "*" 2 
.SH annotated_transition  Overrides any clock tree timing engine-computed transition at the specified pin, in a manner similar to that of SDC set_annotated_transition command.  Default: auto  Applicable arguments: "-delay_corner <name>", "-pin <name>", "-early", "-late", "-rise" and "-fall". Required: "-pin <name>".
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description of the update_clock_tree_spec_annotations command. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command: man update_clock_tree_spec_annotations.  "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Writes commands to the specified file instead of applying the changes in memory. 
.SH   Example
.P Use the set of commands listed below to define a transition annotation at pin b1/I, delay annotation at net_b1, update the annotations from CTE to clock tree timing engine (CTTE), and verify that the annotation is corrected applied at  clock tree timing engine (CTTE).
.P set_interactive_constraint_modes [all_constraint_modes]   set_propagated_clock [all_clocks]
.P create_ccopt_clock_tree -name clk -source clk -no_skew_group  create_ccopt_skew_group -name clk/default_constraint_mode -sources clk -auto_sinks
.P Annotate transition at b1/I pin using the below command:  set_annotated_transition 1.234 [get_pins {b1/I}]
.P Annotate delay at net_b1 net using the below command:  set_annotated_delay 2.345 -net -from [get_pins {b1/Z}] -to [get_pins {b2_2/I}]
.P Update the annotations from CTE to CTTE using the below command:
.P update_clock_tree_spec_annotations
