.SH Name \fBswapSignal\fR \-  Swaps signal between selected instances (I/O pads or bumps). 
.P To swap bump assignments in a circle, determine the value of offset you want to use. Assuming that the value of offset is N, the number of the selected bumps is M, the order of the input bump is $index, and the name of the bump with $index is bump_$index, you can swap bump assignments in a circle by using the the following command:
.P swapSignal -from {bump_1 bump_2 bump_3
..
.SH Syntax \fBswapSignal\fR  [-help]  [[-from {<nameList>} -to {<nameList>}] | -circle_offset <value>]

... bump_$index} -to {bump_[1+N] bump_[2+N] bump_[3+N]... bump_[$index+N-M]} 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description of the swapSignal command.  For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man swapSignal  "\fB-circle_offset <value>\fR" Specifies the offset value to swap bumps in circle. The value should be be positive and less than the number of the selected bumps.  For example, if you select the bumps bump1, bump2, bump3, bump4 and bump5 in the GUI and specify -circle_offset as 2, the result of signal swapping will be as follows:  bump1(S1) bump2(S2) bump3(S3) bump4(S4) bump5 (S5) -> bump1(S4) bump2(S5) bump3(S1) bump4(S2) bump5 (S3)  "\fB-from <nameList>\fR" Specifies the names of bumps from which signal is to be swapped.   "\fB-to <nameList>\fR" Specifies the names of bumps to which signal is to be swapped. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The bumps Bump_74_3_7 and Bump_23_2_2 are selected. The following command swaps the signal between them:  swapSignal  "*" 2  The bumps Bump_100_9_9, Bump_90_9_8, Bump_80_9_7, and Bump_70_9_6 are selected. The following command swaps the bump assignments between them in a circle with an offset value of 1:  swapSignal -circle_offset 1
