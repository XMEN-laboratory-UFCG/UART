.TH viewLog  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBviewLog\fR \-  Opens up a log file in a separate console window for viewing within the Innovus
.SH Syntax \fBviewLog\fR  [-help]  [-file <logFileName>] 
.P Opens up a log file in a separate console window for viewing within the Innovus.
.P The log file viewer within the Innovus opens the current log file by default, and updates it in real time. If you specify a log file name, the software opens up the specified log file.
.P The log file displayed contains [+] and [-] markers that expand and collapse command information, so that you can control how much detail you want to read. Log messages are color coded for easier identification: blue messages are warnings, red messages are errors.
.P You can access documentation for commands in the log file that are underlined. Click on the command in the file, and the software opens an HTML window displaying the Innovus Text Command Reference documentation for that command.
.P You also can access the log file viewer from the Tools Menu - Log Viewer.
.P Note: You can specify viewLog more than once to view multiple log files in separate console windows simultaneously. However, you cannot open multiple versions of the current log file. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-file <logFileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the log file to open.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each viewLog parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man viewLog.
