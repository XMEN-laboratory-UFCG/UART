.TH update_library_set  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBupdate_library_set\fR \-  Updates an existing specified library set
.SH Syntax \fBupdate_library_set\fR    [-help]  [-aocv <string>]  [-library_side_file <string>]  -name <libSetName>  [-si <string>]  [-socv <string>]  [-timing <string>]
.P Updates an existing specified library set.
.P Note: You can edit a library set before (or after) the multi-mode multi-corner view definition file is loaded into the design. However, after the software processes the file, any change to an existing object when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner mode resets the timing, delay calculation, and RC data. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-aocv <string>\fR" Specifies a list of new AOCV libraries to include in the specified library set.  "\fB-library_side_file <string>\fR" Specifies the library side file.   "\fB-name <libSetName>\fR" Specifies the name of an existing library set to be updated. The library set must have been defined using the create_library_set command.  "\fB-si <string><>\fR" Specifies a list of new cdB libraries and user-defined noise (UDN) models to include in the library set.  "\fB-socv <string>\fR" Specifies a list of new SOCV libraries to be included in the library set.   "\fB-timing <string>\fR" Specifies a list of new timing libraries to include in the specified library set.  Note: The ECSM and CCS libraries can be very large and loading them may take significant time. You can convert the ASCII NLDM (Liberty
.lib), ECSM, and CCS libraries to a binary version using the write_ldb command. For conversion of libraries to a binary version, refer to write_ldb.  Instead of the original ASCII libraries, you can specify the following binary libraries in the configuration file:  create_library_set -name libName -timing "AAA.lib BBB.ecsm CCC.ccs" 
.SH   Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a library set that associates timing libraries and cdB libraries with a nominal voltage of 1 volt with the library name IsCOM-1V:   create_library_set -name IsCOM-1V -timing [list stdcell_F_1V.lib ram_F.lib pad.lib]   The following command changes the timing libraries associated with the library set IsCOM-1V:update_library_set -name IsCOM-1V -timing [list stdcell_CVF_1V.lib ram_CVF.lib pad.lib ]
