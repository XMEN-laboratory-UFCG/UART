.SH Name \fBstaggerBondPad\fR \-  Generates a staggered wirebond pad pattern on top of an existing I/O ring
.SH Syntax \fBstaggerBondPad\fR  [-help]   {-startIoInstName <instName> [-endIoInstName <instName>] | -ring <number> |   -side {e | w | n | s} [-ring <number>] | -all}  {-pattern <pattern_string> | -startStaggerPosition {i | m | o}}  [-pad <position> <padName position padName...>]  [-pinName <pinName>] 
.P Generates a staggered wirebond pad pattern on top of an existing I/O ring. In this design methodology, bond pads are separate LEF macro definitions from the I/O driver cells, but are placed on top of the I/O driver cells to form the combined bond pad and I/O driver circuitry.
.P The command only supports CLASS PAD  instances.
.P To produce the staggered pattern, multiple bond pad cells are defined in the LEF for each I/O cell, each with its bond pad in a specific location corresponding to an outer, middle, or inner stagger position. The bond pads are defined such that when placed on the I/O cell, any one of them will connect to the I/O cell pin with no or minimal RDL routing.
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P Innovus generates a stagger pattern by selecting the outer, middle, or inner stagger bond pad to place on each I/O cell based on the location of that I/O instance in the I/O ring and the pattern that is being generated. If the order of the I/O cells is changed, or if cells are added or deleted, the stagger pattern may be regenerated. Because the bond pad macros are separately defined, they can be easily swapped with bond pads of different stagger positions without changing the logic of the design.
.P To define the relationship between the bond pads and I/O cells in the LEF file,   the following properties must be defined in each LEF file where they are referenced:
.P PROPERTYDEFINITIONS
.P  PIN bondPadOuter STRING;
.P  PIN bondPadMiddle STRING;
.P  PIN bondPadInner STRING;
.P  PIN ioCellOriginX REAL;
.P  PIN ioCellOriginY REAL;
.P  MACRO ioCellOffsetX REAL;
.P  MACRO ioCellOffsetY REAL;
.P  END PROPERTYDEFINITIONS
.P The LEF macros define the property values as follows:
.P MACRO IOCELL
.P  CLASS PAD ;
.P 
...
.P  SIZE 50.0 BY 225 ;
.P 
...
.P  PIN PAD
.P  PROPERTY bondPadOuter "BUMPA BUMPA1 BUMPD" ;
.P  PROPERTY bondPadMiddle "BUMPB" ;
.P  PROPERTY bondPadInner "BUMPC" ;
.P  PROPERTY ioCellOriginX 25.0 ;
.P  PROPERTY ioCellOriginY 0.0 ;
.P  END PAD
.P  END IOCELL
.P MACRO BUMPA
.P  CLASS COVER BUMP
.P 
...
.P  PROPERTY ioCellOffsetX -40 ; 
.P  PROPERTY ioCellOffsetY -70 ;
.P  END BUMPA
.P Innovus automatically names the stagger bond pads as:
.P <IoCellInstName>_PAD<#>
.P Here:
.RS  "*" 2 <IoCellInstName> - Specifies the instance name of the I/O cell on which the bond pad is being placed.  "*" 2 <#> - Specifies the incremented bond pad number. The number 1 is used for all single pad I/O cells. This number is incremented when there are multiple bond pads on a single I/O cell.   For example, if I/O cell CKdiff contained two pins, two bond pads would be placed on this cell and named as CKdiff_PAD1 and CKdiff_PAD2. 
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each staggerBondPad parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man staggerBondPad  "\fB-all\fR" Specifies that bond pads will be placed on all I/O instances.  "\fB-endIoInstName <instName>\fR" Specifies the name of the last I/O instance of where bond pads will be placed. You can use this parameter in conjunction with the -startIoInstName parameter.  Note: Bond pads are placed in a clock-wise pattern from the starting I/O instance (-startIoInstName) to the last I/O instance (-endIoInstName).  "\fB-pad <position><padName><position><padName>...\fR" Specifies which bond pad and position to use when multiple bond pads are specified in the LEF file for a given inner (i), middle (m), or outer (o) position.   For example, If there are three outer bond pads specified in the LEF file, you can use this parameter to choose which bond pad to use as the outer bond pad.  Default: The software uses the first bond pad in the list of bond pads for a given position.  "\fB-pattern <pattern_string>\fR" Specifies the stagger pattern of the bond pads on the I/O instances. <pattern_string> specifies any combination of i (inner), m (middle), and o (outer).  "\fB-pinName <pinName>\fR" Specifies the name of the pin inside the instance. If the instance specified by the -startIoInstName parameter contains multiple pins, you use this parameter to specify which pin to start with.  "\fB-ring <number>\fR" Specifies which ring to operate on with ring 1 being the outer most ring. The ring number is incremented by one as you get closer to the core. For a three-ring design, the inner most ring is ring 3.  "\fB-side {e | w | n | s}\fR" Specifies the geographical side of the die. You can specify the East (e), West (w), North (n), or South (s) side of the die.  "\fB-startIoInstName <instName>\fR" Specifies the name of the first I/O instance of where bond pads will be placed. You can use this parameter in conjunction with the -endIoInstName parameter. If multiple pins exist in the instance, you can use the   -pinName parameter to specify which pin to start with.  Note: Bond pads are placed in a clock-wise pattern from the starting I/O instance (-startIoInstName) to the last I/O instance (-endIoInstName) if applicable.  "\fB-startStaggerPosition {i | m | o}\fR" Specifies the starting stagger position of the specified bond pad (-pad) on the specified I/O instance   (-startIoInstName). You can start the stagger position of the bond pad using the inner (i), middle (m), or outer (o) position. The default stagger position sequence is inner (i), middle (m), and outer (o). If you start with a stagger position of middle (m), the next bond pad is placed in an outer (o) stagger position followed by a bond pad placed in an inner (i) stagger position. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places bond pads on all I/O instances using a stagger pattern of inner, outer, and middle and using bond pad BUMPA1 at the outer position:   staggerBondPad -all -pattern iom -pad o BUMPA1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places bond pads on the I/O instances of the outer most ring (East side) starting with a bond pad placed in the middle stagger position:   staggerBondPad -side e -startStaggerPosition m -ring 1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command places bond pads from I/O instance abc to I/O instance xyz, starting with pin PAD of I/O instance abc and using an inner, inner, outer stagger pattern:   staggerBondPad -startIoInstName abc -endIoInstName xyz -pinName PAD -pattern iio
