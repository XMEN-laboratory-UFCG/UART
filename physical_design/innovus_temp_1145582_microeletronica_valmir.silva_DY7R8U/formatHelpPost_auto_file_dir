.P Specifies the directory to store files/sub-directories 'auto-generated' by the tool. This includes report files or other output files with default names that are automatically created by some commands in the current run directory. Default names that have been overridden with a name chosen by the user, are not affected. This allows multiple simultaneous runs from the same run directory to direct output files to different result directories to avoid collisions.
