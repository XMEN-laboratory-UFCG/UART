.SH Name \fBtiming_extract_model_disable_cycle_adjustment\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_extract_model_disable_cycle_adjustment\fR   {true | false}
.P Default: false
.P Controls cycle adjustment for multi-cycle paths.
.P When set to false, if the multi-cycle paths specified in the SDC at the block-level cannot be pushed out to the ports (since there are other paths going through these paths), then the Tempus software adjusts the delay/check numbers in the ETM to take into account the cycle adjustment.
.P When set to true, the cycle adjustment for the multi-cycle paths in ETM arc delay are disabled.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
