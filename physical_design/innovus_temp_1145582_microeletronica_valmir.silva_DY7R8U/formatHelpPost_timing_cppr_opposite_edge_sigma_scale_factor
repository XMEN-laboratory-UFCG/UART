.TH timing_cppr_opposite_edge_sigma_scale_factor  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_cppr_opposite_edge_sigma_scale_factor\fR \-  Default: 1.0
.P Value Range: 0 to 1
.P Controls the sigma delay component for CPPR credit for opposite transition edges at a common pin
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_cppr_opposite_edge_sigma_scale_factor\fR   {0.0 | 1.0} 
.P Default: 1.0
.P Value Range: 0 to 1
.P Controls the sigma delay component for CPPR credit for opposite transition edges at a common pin.
.P This global variable provides a finer level configuration of the CPPR credit for reducing Common Path Pessimism Removal (CPPR) in timing analysis.
.P You can use timing_cppr_opposite_edge_mean_scale_factor global variable for adjustment of the mean component of the CPPR credit. In SOCV analysis mode, you can use both of these global variables to separately control the adjustment of the mean and sigma components of the CPPR credit. In static-timing analysis (STA) mode, only the mean scale factor is considered.
.P You can use the set command to set this global variable.
