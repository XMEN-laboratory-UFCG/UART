.SH Name \fBjustifyBudget\fR \-  Queries and verifies the timing budgets generated by the Innovus software
.SH Syntax \fBjustifyBudget\fR   [-help]  {<partitionName> | <instanceName>}  {-pins <pinList>}  [-outfile <fileName>]   [-summary]  [-view <viewName>]
.P Queries and verifies the timing budgets generated by the Innovus software. You can also query budgets selectively for some/all partitions or instances.
.P The justifyBudget command honors the report_timing_format global, which allows you to customize the timing report according to the specified columns. You must set this global before specifying justifyBudget or deriveTimingBudget -justify to get the report in the desired format.
.P Note: In case of combined budgeting, the justifyBudget command will justify all the input or output delays attached to the port of a partition.   Note: The justifyBudget command only supports the -summary parameter in MMMC mode (the default mode). The report will contain only the headers. To print paths, use deriveTimingBudget -justify.
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each justifyBudget parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man justifyBudget  "\fB<-outfile fileName>\fR" Specifies the output file name that contains timing budget data for a pin.  "\fB<partitionName> | <instanceName>\fR" Specifies the name of the partition/instance to analyze. When used with -mergeClones, the software reports the worst-case data for specified partition/instance pins in the master/clone set containing the partition/instance. The <instanceName> can only be specified when the  deriveTimingBudget  command is used with the -inst option. In default partition mode, the <partitionName> is specified.  "\fB-pins <pinList>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical partition pin(s) to be analyzed. You can use * to specify all pins.  "\fB-summary\fR" Displays the style summary report containing the header section of the full report to show budget calculation only. Use this parameter after using saveTimingBudget/savePartition.    "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Prints a report for the specified view. If you derived the timing budget in MMMC mode (default), this parameter is required to obtain a report. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 For examples of budgeting for MMMC designs, see the Timing Budgeting chapter of the Innovus User Guide.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates the timing budget data for the pin input of partition/instance partition1 and prints a report for view SETUP_VIEW1:   justifyBudget partition1 -pins input -view SETUP_VIEW1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command generates the timing budget data for all pins of the partition/instance partition1 and prints a report for viewing HOLD_VIEW1 in the file justifyData:   justifyBudget partition1 -pins * -outfile justifydata -view HOLD_VIEW1
