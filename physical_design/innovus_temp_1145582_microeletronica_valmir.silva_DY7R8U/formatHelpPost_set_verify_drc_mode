.P Sets the global parameters for the verify_drc command. Parameters specified with the set_verify_drc_mode command are used automatically whenever verify_drc is being run. The settings are saved in the design database and will be restored after reloading a database saved earlier.
.P Use the get_verify_drc_mode command to return the current values of the set_verify_drc_mode parameters.
.P set_verify_drc_mode is pre-configured with a set of default parameter values. The -reset parameter can be used to reset all or certain parameters to the default values.
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description of each set_verify_drc_mode parameter, including type and default value.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man set_verify_drc_mode   "\fB-area {x1 y1 x2 y2}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the area to be verified. If the area specified is bigger than the chip boundary, all the objects inside and outside the die will be verified. If the -area parameter is not specified, the objects within the chip boundary are verified against the design rules.  Default: {0 0 0 0}  "\fB-check_illegal_trim_shapes {true | false}\fR" Checks the missing trim shapes for a fulfilled design.   "\fB-check_ndr_spacing {true | false | auto}\fR" Checks non-default rule spacing as a hard rule. Following are the parameter values:
.RS  "*" 2 true: Checks all non-default rules.  "*" 2 false: Skips checking any non-default rule.  "*" 2 auto: Checks only the non-default rules with hard_spacing.
.RE   Default: auto  Note: When the setNanoRouteMode -route_enforce_route_rule_on_special_net_wire parameter is set to true, the non-default rule for special net is also checked.  "\fB-check_only {all | regular | special | selected_net | selected | cell | default}\fR" Specifies which types of shapes are checked against the design rules. Following are the various values of this parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 all: Reports the violations between all routing shapes (regular and special) and all other shapes, including routing blockages and cell pin/obs shapes.  "*" 2 regular: Reports only the violations between regular routing shapes (normally created by NanoRoute) and all other shapes. It does not report violations between special routes, routing blockages and cell shapes. This is useful to find violations caused only by NanoRoute.  "*" 2 special: Reports only the violations between the special routes and all other shapes. It does not report violations between the regular routes, routing blockages, and cell shapes. This is useful while checking the power routing or pre-routed special routes with isolating these errors from other violations.  "*" 2 selected_net: Reports only the violations between the objects on the selected nets. Before running verify_drc, the nets need to be selected with the selectNet command.  "*" 2 selected: Reports only the violations on special wire objects/vias of the secondary PG nets with the specified user class.  "*" 2 cell: Reports only the violations between the shapes of cells including the objects inside the same cell and different cells.  "*" 2 default: This value is equivalent to specifying the regular and special at the same time.
.RE   Default: default  "\fB-check_reverse\fR" Reports the CONVEXCORNER REVERSE violation in the flow.   Default: false  "\fB-check_routing_halo {true | false}\fR" Checks for routing violations in the routing halo area. It also creates the DRV markers on any routing wire parallel to the block boundary or design boundary.  Default: false  "\fB-check_routing_halo_corner {true | false}\fR" Checks for routing violations in the halo corner. It also creates the DRV markers on all the routing wires in the halo corner.  Default: false  "\fB-check_same_via_cell {true | false}\fR" Checks the DRC issues in the same via cell.  Default: false  "\fB-check_short_only {true | false}\fR" Excludes checking all other DRCs except the short ones.   "\fB-check_trim_length {true|false}\fR" Checks for the maximum length on the trim shape layer.   "\fB-check_uncolored {true | false}\fR" Reports the color change violation when the DPT layer shapes have no color.   "\fB-disable_rules {jog2jog_spacing | eol_spacing | cut_spacing | min_cut | enclosure | color | min_step | protrusion | min_area | out_of_die | off_manufacturing_grid | off_routing_track}\fR" Disables checking of the specified design rules. The supported values for the rule list are: jog2jog_spacing, eol_spacing, cut_spacing, min_cut, enclosure, color, min_step, protrusion, min_area, out_of_die, off_manufacturing_grid, and off_routing_track  Use this parameter to make only specific checks with verify_drc and to skip checking certain design rules.  Examples:  The following set of commands disables the eol_spacing check and runs verify_drc. In other words, all other rules are checked by verify_drc, except eol_spacing.   set_verify_drc_mode -disable_rules {eol_spacing}   verify_drc  Default: "" This means no rules are disabled.  "\fB-enable_post_passive_fill_check {true | false}\fR" Checks if the track is fully filled for the full_fill trim layer.   "\fB-exclude_pg_net {true | false}\fR" Disables the design rule checking on power and ground nets.  Default: false  "\fB-ignore_cell_blockage {true | false}\fR" Ignores geometries of cell blockages inside cell.  Default: false  "\fB-ignore_fill_wire {true | false}\fR" Ignores metal fill wires while checking DRCs.   "\fB-ignore_non_rectangle_shapes {true | false}\fR" When set to true, this parameter ignores checking DRC markers for the objects with the non-rectangular shapes. When set to false, it checks DRC markers for the objects of all shapes.  Default: true  "\fB-ignore_trial_route {true | false}\fR" Ignores early global route objects while checking design rules.  Default: false  "\fB-layer_range {<layer1> [<layer2>]}\fR" Checks all the metal and cut layers between the specified bottom and  top layers. You can use the full layer name, or abbreviations such as 1 for the routing layer number, etc. For example, -layer_range {M1 M3} will check all the metal and cut layers between M1 and M3 (including M1 and M3). If <layer2> is not specified, it only checks design rules on <layer1>.  "\fB-limit <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of errors to be reported.  Default: 1000  "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the output report file, which will contain the detailed violation report. If the -report parameter is not specified, no external report will be saved.  Note: The output file will be overwritten each time verify_drc is run, if the filename is not changed in the meantime.  Default:  ""  "\fB-max_wrong_way_halo <haloLength>\fR" Specifies the length up to which short jog shapes in halo area can be ignored. Routing halos are used to avoid cross-coupling between top-level and inside-the-block routes, and short jogs do not affect cross-coupling much. Normally, it is better to have some short jogs rather than more vias. When this option is specified, any segment with length less than <haloLength> is ignored for wrong way check, even if it overlaps with the halo region. verify_drc reports violations only for jog shapes with lengths greater than <haloLength.>  Default: If you do not specify the -max_wrong_way_halo option, verify_drc uses 4* <pitch>as the default value, where <pitch>is the METAL2 routing pitch.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all, or a list of specified parameters. If no parameter(s) are specified, this parameter resets all the parameters. Any values, that do not already match the default value, are reset and reported. Values, that already match the default value for a particular parameter, will not be reported.  Example:  set_verify_drc_mode -reset -report -limit   "\fB-use_min_spacing_on_block_obs {true | false | auto}\fR" Performs as below with various parameter values:
.RS  "*" 2 true: Checks the Macro OBS with minSpacing. If the OBS SPACING was specified in the LEF file, it honors the SPACING from LEF.    "*" 2 false: Considers the Macro OBS as real metal to check the spacing rules. If the OBS SPACING was specified in the LEF file, it honors the SPACING from LEF.  "*" 2 auto: Considers the Macro OBS as real metal, if the OBS width is lesser than or equal to maxWidth. It also checks the Macro OBS with minSpacing if the OBS width is greater than maxWidth. If the OBS SPACING was specified in the LEF file, it honors the SPACING from LEF.
