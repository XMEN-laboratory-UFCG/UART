.SH Name \fBplace_opt_design\fR \-  Executes pre-CTS flow with both placement and pre-CTS optimization
.SH Syntax \fBplace_opt_design\fR   [-help]   [-expanded_views]   [-incremental]  [-incremental_timing]  [-num_paths <number_of_paths>]   [-out_dir <outputDirectory>]  [-prefix <outputFileName>]  [-timing_debug_report]
.P Executes pre-CTS flow with both placement and pre-CTS optimization.
.P Earlier, users had to perform the following two steps to do placement and preCTS optimization:
.RS  "*" 2 place_design  "*" 2 optDesign -preCTS
.RE
.P With place_opt_design, users need to run only a single command to do placement and preCTS optimization.
.P The place_opt_design command provides better integration between placement and optimization to achieve faster runtime and better PPA.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each place_opt_design parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man place_opt_design.  "\fB-expanded_views\fR" Prints timing information for each active view at the end of the command restoring all pruned views if absent.  "\fB-incremental\fR" Specifies place_opt_design to be run in the incremental mode. In the incremental mode place_opt_design incrementally improves the existing placement based on the critical timing paths and congestion. The command then re-optimizes the netlist based on the new placement. The optimization in incremental place_opt_design does DRV fixing, WNS, and TNS optimization.    The input to place_opt_design -incremental can be either a partial placement or full placement with placement violations, and the output is a legal placement as place_detail is called at the end. This can be used if you want to further improve the congestion and timing QoR or if there is a minor floorplan change and this by default, congestion-driven, and timing-driven. It also honors density screens and floorplan constraints. If you run place_opt_design and notice some areas of congestion, you can introduce density screens and run place_opt_design -incremental. As place_opt_design -incremental honors density screens, it would spread out some of the cells, reducing congestion in that area. In contrast, place_detail would not do this as it only works on the hard placement violations such as cell overlaps, while density screens is a "soft" constraint.   There is no scan-reordering done in place_opt_design -incremental.  Note: Early clock flow mode place_opt_design -incremental reuses the existing early clock flow clock tree without any logical or physical modification and makes adjustments only to useful skew using virtual delays. It is also essential to note that the CCOpt clock tree spec must not be deleted between the original and incremental place_opt_design steps, just like it must not be done between place_opt_design and ccopt_design, otherwise any useful skew will be lost.   "\fB-incremental_timing\fR" In the incremental_timing mode,  place_opt_design does incremental DRV and timing optimization. In this mode,  place_opt_design incrementally optimizes the critical timing path. Also, the optimization in incremental timing  place_opt_design does DRV fixing, WNS, and TNS optimization.    "\fB-num_paths <number_of_paths>\fR" Specifies the number of paths reported in the timing report. By default, all timing paths are reported.   "\fB-out_dir <outputDirectory>\fR" Specifies the output directory in which the timing/drv reports will be saved.   "\fB-prefix <outputFileName>\fR" Specifies the file name prefix for the timing/drv reports that are generated at the end of place_opt_design.  "\fB-timing_debug_report\fR" When specified, generates a machine-readable timing debug report after completing placement and preCTS optimization. This report is used for debugging timing results using the timing debug feature in Innovus.  Note: You can specify the number of paths to be reported using the -num_paths parameter.
