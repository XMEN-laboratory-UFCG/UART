.TH spaceObject  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBspaceObject\fR \-  Spaces objects (instances, modules, or blockages) horizontally or vertically by a specified distance value, and can evenly distribute the spacing horizontally or vertically between three or more objects. You can use this command after selecting two or more objects in the design display area
.SH Syntax   \fBspaceObject\fR     [-help]    -fixSide {left | right | center | top | bottom | middle | distHorizontal | distVertical}     [-honorHalo]     [-space <value>[-isSpaceMeanLLtoLL ]<>]  
.P Spaces objects (instances, modules, or blockages) horizontally or vertically by a specified distance value, and can evenly distribute the spacing horizontally or vertically between three or more objects. You can use this command after selecting two or more objects in the design display area.
.P Note: To space I/O cells, use the spaceIoInst command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-fixSide\fR" Specifies the vertical and horizontal object spacing. Choose one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 left: Specifies that the left most object is fixed and all other objects are shifted horizontally to the right side of the fixed object, maintaining space defined in the -space option.  "*" 2 right: Specifies that the right most object is fixed and all other objects are shifted horizontally to the left side of the fixed object, maintaining space defined in the -space option.  "*" 2 center: Maintains the center point of the selected objects. It calculates the mid-point between the left most edge and right most edge of the selected objects and then spaces the blocks at the specified distance and centers them around this mid-point so that the left most edge and right most edge are at an equal distance from the mid-point.  "*" 2 top: Specifies that the top most object is fixed and all other objects are shifted vertically to the down side of the fixed object, maintaining space defined in the -space option.  "*" 2 bottom: Specifies that the bottom most object is fixed and all other objects are shifted vertically to the up side of the fixed object, maintaining space defined in the -space option.  "*" 2 middle: Maintains the center point of the selected objects. It calculates the mid-point between the top most edge and bottom most edge of the selected objects and then spaces the blocks at the specified distance and centers them around this mid-point so that the top most edge and bottom most edge are at an equal distance from the mid-point.  "*" 2 distHorizontal: Specifies an even horizontal distribution.  "*" 2 distVertical: Specifies an even vertical distribution.
.RE   Data_type: enum, required  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each spaceObject parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man spaceObject  "\fB-honorHalo\fR" Honors placement halo. With this option on, selected objects are spaced by a given value measured from the edge of the halo and not from the edge of the object.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-isSpaceMeanLLtoLL         \fR" When specified it signifies that the spacing value denotes the distance from the Object A's lower left to Object B's lower left. By default, this parameter is false. This implies that the spacing value signifies the distance between the bounding of Object A and Object B.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-space <value>  \fR" Specifies the spacing value, in micrometers.  Data_type: float, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command fixes the bottom-most highlighted object and moves all the other objects vertically to the top, spacing the objects 5 micrometers apart from each other:
.P spaceObject -fixSide bottom -space 5
