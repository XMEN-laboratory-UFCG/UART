.TH setPtnPinStatus  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsetPtnPinStatus\fR \-  Sets the pin status for a pin of a partition as fixed, placed, cover, or unplaced. The setPtnPinStatus command operates, like a lot of other pin commands, on the top cell in addition to on partitions
.SH Syntax \fBsetPtnPinStatus\fR   [-help]   [-selectedPinStatus {fixed | placed | cover}]  [-pin {<pinName>| <pinNameList>}]   [-status {fixed | placed | unplaced | cover}]  {[-pin {<pinName>| <pinNameList>} -status{fixed | placed | unplaced | cover} [-cell <partitionName>]] }
.P Sets the pin status for a pin of a partition as fixed, placed, cover, or unplaced. The setPtnPinStatus command operates, like a lot of other pin commands, on the top cell in addition to on partitions. If the top cell name is specified, or if setPtnPinStatus receives a "*" as its first argument, the IO pin status is modified. You can use this command any time after assigning pins.
.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 Use this command to unassign blackbox pins before the blackbox is committed. To unassign blackbox pins after the blackbox is committed, use the flattenPartition command instead.  "*" 2 If this command is run on a blackbox that has one or more pins with a single LEF port but with multiple shapes within the LEF port, the command will remove these multiple shapes and create a single shape. If this command is run on a blackbox that has one or more pins with multiple LEF ports, the first LEF port will be processed as per the command and the remaining LEF ports will remain unchanged.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-cell <partitionName>\fR" Specifies the name of the partition. You can use wildcards (*?) with this parameter.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setPtnPinStatus parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setPtnPinStatus.  "\fB-pin <pinName> | <pinNameList>\fR" Specifies the name of the pin(s) of the partition. You can use wildcards (*?) with this parameter.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-selectedPinStatus {fixed | placed | cover}\fR" Selects pins with only specified status. This options enables the setPtnPinStatus command to change the status of selected pins based on their present status and not just the names.
.RS  "*" 2 fixed: Selects pins with fixed status.  "*" 2 placed: Selects pins with placed status.  "*" 2 cover: Selects pins with cover status.
.RE   Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-status {fixed | placed | unplaced | cover}\fR" Specifies the status of the pin.
.RS  "*" 2 Fixed: Fixed pin status specifies the pin's location, orientation, and that it's location cannot be moved by automatic tools, but can be moved by interactive commands.  Note: Fixed pins can be moved by automatic pin assignment commands by using the -moveFixed parameter.  "*" 2 Placed: Placed pin status specifies the pin's location, orientation, and that it's location is fixed, but can be moved during automatic layout.   "*" 2 Unplaced: Unplaced pin status specifies that the pin does not have a location.  "*" 2 cover: Cover pin status specifies the pin's location, orientation, and that it is a part of the cover macro. A cover pin cannot be moved by automatic tools or by interactive commands. 
.RE   Data_type: enum, optional 
.SH Example
