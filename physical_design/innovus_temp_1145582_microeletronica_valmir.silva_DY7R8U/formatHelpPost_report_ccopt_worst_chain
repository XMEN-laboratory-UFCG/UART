.SH Name \fBreport_ccopt_worst_chain\fR \-  This command displays information about the worst chain, which is the chain that contains the path with the worst negative slack or WNS in the design
.SH Syntax \fBreport_ccopt_worst_chain\fR  [-help]  [-check_type {setup | hold}]  [-file <filename>]  [-through <pin> |<>-through_file <filename>]  [-view <viewname>] 
.P This command displays information about the worst chain, which is the chain that contains the path with the worst negative slack or WNS in the design. CCOpt is able to move slack between paths, so the fundamental timing constraint is not from one flop to the next, but chains of floptoflop paths. At each flop, timing can be shifted before or after the flop in order to make the physical optimization problem easier. 
.P The command reports a chain as a series of nodes linked together by timing paths. Additionally, it contains information to let you determine how well the chain has been optimized. This report contains the following information:
.RS  "*" 2 The timing chain containing the worst flop-to-flop path, which is identified in the report output by the string, "*WNS*"  "*" 2 Timing path and constraint information to show why that WNS cannot be improved  "*" 2 The path group name for each path

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_ccopt_worst_chain parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man report_ccopt_worst_chain.   "\fB-check_type setup | hold\fR" Specifies whether setup views or hold views are used for the report.  Default: By default, only the worst chain for setup views is reported.   "\fB-file <filename>\fR" Specifies that a copy of  the contents of the report will be saved to the specified file name.   "\fB-through <pin>\fR" Specifies the path through which the worst chain is being reported. When this parameter is specified, the chain containing the given pin or port is reported. The timing path which contains the -through pin is labelled with *SEL*.   When this parameter is not specified, the chain with the WNS timing path is reported. The WNS timing path in the chain is labelled *WNS*.  "\fB-through_file <filename>\fR" Creates a worst chain report for each pin or port in the specified file.  Note: The parameters, -through and -through_file are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-view <viewname>\fR" Specifies the view for which the worst chain is being reported.
