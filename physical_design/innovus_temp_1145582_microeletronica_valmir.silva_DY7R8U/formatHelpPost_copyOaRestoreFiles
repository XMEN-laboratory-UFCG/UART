.SH Name \fBcopyOaRestoreFiles\fR \-  Copies Innovus-specific restore files from one OpenAccess database to another
.SH Syntax \fBcopyOaRestoreFiles\fR  <fromLib fromCell fromView>  <toLib toCell toView> 
.P Copies Innovus-specific restore files from one OpenAccess database to another. The software copies all of the files (except master.tag and layout.oa) and renames those with the cell to match the toCell cell name. This feature supports the ECO flow, where a cellview saved with the saveDesign command and set of restore files is edited by an external tool (Virtuoso Chip Editor), then saved to a new database to avoid overwriting the unedited version. The external tool does not copy the restore files to the new cellview.
.P If the originating database does not contain restore files (such as cell.conf, cell.mode, siFix.options, and enc.pref.tcl, then the software generates an error message such as the following:
.P ERROR: No restore Files found at specified source   /usr4/Tests/CE/OA22/PC44d_test/mydesign/top/layout
.P If the destination OpenAccess database already contains restore files, the software generates a warning message and overwrites the files.
.P You can use the copyOaRestoreFiles command after you start a new Innovus session, and before you use the restoreDesign -cellview command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB<fromLib> <fromCell> <fromView>\fR" Specifies the location of the files to copy. This is the design from the previous Innovus session.  "\fB<toLib> <toCell> <toView>\fR" Specifies where to copy the files. This refers to the new design. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command copies Innovus-specific restore files from myDesign/topCell/layout to newDesign/newTopCell/newLayout:   copyOaRestoreFiles myDesign topCell layout newDesign newTopCell newLayout
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following procedure performs ECOs with the Virtuoso Chip Editor:
.RS  "*" 2 From an Innovus session, save the OpenAccess design.  saveDesign -cellview {<lib> <cell> <view>}  "*" 2 Exit the Innovus session.  "*" 2 Open the OpenAccess database in the Virtuoso Chip Editor tool and edit the design. Exit the tool.  Note: You must use either of the following: Virtuoso Chip Editor, Virtuoso Layout XL , or Virtuoso Layout GXL.  "*" 2 Start an Innovus session.  "*" 2 Copy Innovus-specific files from the old design to the new design.  copyOaRestoreFiles <fromLib> <fromCell> <fromView> <toLib> <toCell> <toView>  "*" 2 Restore the OpenAccess design.  restoreDesign -cellview {<lib> <cell> <view>}
