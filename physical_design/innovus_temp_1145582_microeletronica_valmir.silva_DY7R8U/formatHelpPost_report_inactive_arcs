.SH Name \fBreport_inactive_arcs\fR \-  Reports information about disabled timing and timing check arcs in the design
.SH Syntax \fBreport_inactive_arcs\fR  [-help]   [<instance_or_port_list>]  [-exclude_type {const snipped disable library_disable global_disable conditional_disable Library_Mode}]  [-include_net_arcs]  [-include_when_cond]  [-type {const snipped disable library_disable global_disable conditional_disable Library_Mode power_mode_disable}]  [-view <view_name>]   [> <filename[.gz]>]  [>> <filename[.gz]>]  [-delay_arcs_only | -check_arcs_only]
.P Reports information about disabled timing and timing check arcs in the design. Reports all arcs disabled due to user-specified exceptions such as set_disable_timingor set_case_analysis, as well as information about arcs disabled by constant propagation during timing analysis, snipped loop arcs, and arcs disabled in the timing library.
.P The report output prints only the 'from' and 'to' information of arcs, and not the full instance name for each arc. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB<instance_or_port_list>\fR" Reports disabled timing arcs for the specified list of instances or ports. If you specify a list of instances, the software reports all disabled arcs of the specified cells. If you specify a list of ports, the software reports all disabled arcs directly connected to the ports.  Default: Reports all disabled net and cell arcs.  "\fB-check_arcs_only\fR" Lists only disabled check arcs. The check_arcs are disabled by using the set_disable_timing command.  Default: Both disabled timing delay arcs and check arcs are listed.  "\fB-delay_arcs_only\fR" Lists only disabled timing delay arcs.  "\fB-exclude_type {const snipped disable library_disable global_disable conditional_disable Library_Mode}\fR" Excludes the disabled arcs that belong to the specified category of disabled arcs.  The valid options are: const, snipped, disable, library_disable, global_disable, conditional_disable, and, Library_Mode.  "\fB-include_net_arcs\fR" Includes disabled net arcs in the report.  "\fB-include_when_cond\fR" Shows the when_cond of arcs in the output report.   "\fB-type {const snipped disable library_disable global_disable conditional_disable Library_Mode power_mode_disable}\fR" Lists only the disabled arcs that belong to the specified category of disabled arcs.  The -type options restrict the report to only those arcs which are disabled due to a particular timing analysis step, such as constant propagation, specified disables, or loop arc disables. The valid type options are:
.RS  "*" 2 const:Propagated constant -- arcs disabled due to a constant value. The constant value can apply to one of the arc nets/pins, to side inputs which disable a condition for the arc, to nets that disable an active mode for the arc, or disable a default conditional arc.  "*" 2 snipped:Loop snipped arcs -- arcs automatically disabled by the software as part of a feedback loop.  "*" 2 disable:Defined by using the set_disable_timing command.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 library_disable: Delay arc disabled due to library disables. These disables may be caused by the following conditions:
.RS  "*" 2 Disables specified using the set_disable_timing command.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The arc is an asynchronous arc and the timing_enable_preset_clear_arcs global variable is set to false.
.RE  "*" 2 global_disable: Lists the arcs that are disabled through user-specified global variable settings.   "*" 2 conditional_disable: Arcs disabled if a when condition is specified. There is no constant on sink or source pin and arc is disabled due to the when condition.  "*" 2 Library_Mode: Displays library mode of disabled arcs.  "*" 2 power_mode_disable: Reports the arcs for which power mode is disabled.
.RE   "\fB-view <view_name>\fR" Generates the report for the specified analysis view only. You can specify this parameter only when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner timing analysis mode.  "\fB{> | >>} <filename>\fR" When specified with >, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.  The <filename> parameter must be the last argument in the list.  Note: To write a compressed report, add the
.gz extension to the file name.  Default: Report is displayed on standard output without being saved. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reports all disabled arcs in the design:   report_inactive_arcs > Report  The following example shows the report generated:  -----------------------------------------------  Flags :   const                propagated constant            snipped              loop snipped arcs            disable              set_disable_timing            disable_clock_gating set_disable_clock_gating            library_disable      set_disable_cell_timing            Missing_Phase        No Arc Phase Data  From         To           DisableType ArcType              Reason  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  u8/CK ^      u8/D ^       const       hold_rising_clk_rise  u8/D = 1  u8/CK ^      u8/D v       const       hold_falling_clk_rise u8/D = 1  seg3/u12/A ^ seg3/u12/Y v disable     combinational         User Disable  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When the software is in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode, the report generated lists the disabled arcs by active analysis view, as shown in the following example:  --------------------------------------------------  Flags : const propagated constant  snipped loop snipped arcs  disable set_disable_timing  disable_clock_gating set_disable_clock_gating  library_disable set_disable_cell_timing  Missing_Phase No Arc Phase Data  From        To                 DisableType ArcType  Reason         View  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  gscanmode ^ FE_O305_gmode/I ^  const       net_arc  gscanmode = 0  setup_view2  gscanmode v FE_O305_gmode/I v  const       net_arc  gscanmode = 0  setup_view2  gscanmode ^ FE_O305_gmode/I ^  const       net_arc  gscanmode = 0  hold_view1  gscanmode v FE_O305_gmode/I v  const       net_arc  gscanmode = 0  hold_view1  gscanmode ^ FE_O305_gnmode/I ^ const       net_arc  gscanmode = 0  hold_view2  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
