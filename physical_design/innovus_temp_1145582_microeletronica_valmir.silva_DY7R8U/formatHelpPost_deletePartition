.SH Parameters   "\fB-all\fR" Deletes all partitions.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each deletePartition parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man deletePartition.  "\fB-nested\fR" Deletes all nested partitions in the design.  Data_type: bool, optional   "\fB-non_leaf\fR" Deletes all non-leaf partitions in the design.  Note: It saves the information of the deleted partitions in a tcl file, so that the same can be used to restore the deleted partitions.

Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-undo_tcl_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the file that can be sourced to undo deletion of partitions.  With this parameter, the partition definition of the partition being deleted is written to the specified file. Later, if required, this file can be sourced to bring back the partition definition.
