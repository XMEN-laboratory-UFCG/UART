.SH Name \fBinitCoreRow\fR \-  Regenerates rows for the core area and the power domains in a design
.SH Syntax \fBinitCoreRow\fR  [-help]  [-powerDomain <string>]
.P Regenerates rows for the core area and the power domains in a design. The rows are based on the current row parameters instead of using the floorPlan command. You can use this command after importing the design.
.P Note: In a common flow, Innovus goes over all technical sites used in the netlist and creates rows for these sites. It chooses the shortest tech site in the design (with the smallest height and width) as the default-technical-site. All other used tech-sites with integer-multiple height/width are considered as compatible. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description of the initCoreRow command. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:   man initCoreRow  "\fB-powerDomain <string>\fR" Specifies the power domain for which rows are to be created.  Data_type: string, optional
