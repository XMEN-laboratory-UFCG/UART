.SH Name \fBfreeDesign\fR \-  Removes library data and design data from the Innovus database
.SH Syntax \fBfreeDesign\fR [-help] 
.P Removes library data and design data from the Innovus database. This allows you to reload the design in the same session while debugging some problem and provides faster debugging when repeatedly loading files to debug problems inside one session.
.P It does not reset the internal state of applications or global settings, so it is not reliable enough to use in a real flow. For example, it does not free collections but only invalidates them. If you try to access collections saved in TCL variables, you will not be able to see those collections. If you have saved pointers to DB objects in Tcl variables, they will be invalid and may even cause a crash if used.
.P If you have any unexpected problems, you should start a new session without using freeDesign. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description of the freeDesign command usage.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man freeDesign 
.SH Example
.P The intended usage model is given below:
.P init_design (or restoreDesign)
.P <read some files that have problems (such as a Tcl script, MMMC file, LEF file)>
.P <fix the files based on error messages>
.P freeDesign
.P init_design (or restoreDesign)
.P <read modified files to see if they are ok now>
.P If there are still errors, make more modifications, and go back to freeDesign.   If the final result is good, you should start over in a new session and repeat it without freeDesign to continue with the flow.
