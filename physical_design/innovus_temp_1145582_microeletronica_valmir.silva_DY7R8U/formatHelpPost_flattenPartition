.SH Name \fBflattenPartition\fR \-  Uncommits (flattens) the partition back to normal module status
.SH Syntax \fBflattenPartition\fR  [-help]  [<partition_name>]  [-bringBackRow]   [-keepPinGeometry]  [-noUninheritPhysical]  
.P Uncommits (flattens) the partition back to normal module status. This command should also be used to unassign blackbox pins after the blackbox is committed. To unassign blackbox pins before the blackbox is committed, use the setPtnPinStatuscommand. This command unassigns partition pins as well. To bring back row information for a partition, use the -bringBackRow parameter. If the partition rows are non-integer-multiple-height rows or are not aligned with the top-level rows, the flattenPartition command will automatically create a power domain associated with the partition. The power domain will have the following characteristics:
.RS  "*" 2 The timing library will the same as that for the top level.  "*" 2 If a global net connection is defined in the partition block, the power domain will have the same global net connection. Otherwise the global net connection for the power domain will be set to the top-level net connection.  "*" 2 The minimum gap values will be the same as the placement halo values for the partition.
.RE
.P The recommended use model for bringing back non-integer-multiple height rows or unaligned rows is as follows.
.P Top-down flow:
.RS  "*" 2 Create a power domain at full chip-level design.  "*" 2 Specify the same hierarchical instance as the partition
.RE
.P Bottom-up flow:
.RS  "*" 2 Create a power domain at top-level design.  "*" 2 Assign the instance block as a member of the power domain created in step 1.
.RE
.P The flattenPartition command supports partitions with FlexModels. It restores back FlexModel information if the committed partition has a FlexModel netlist. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each flattenPartition parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man flattenPartition  "\fB-bringBackRow\fR" Specifies that partition row information should be brought back for cases where:
.RS  "*" 2 the partition is not a power domain and row information in partition is different from top-level design, and
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 after uncommiting the partition, the rows of the partition space are not aligned with the top-level rows
.RE   When you use this parameter, a power domain is created for the partition.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the row information is not brought back in such cases.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-keepPinGeometry\fR" Specifies that for every partition pin, a DRCFILL metal of the type special route is placed on top of the partition pins.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noUninheritPhysical\fR" Specifies that physical only cell instances are removed during flattenPartition.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB<partitionName>\fR" Specifies the name(s) of the partition(s). You can specify any number of partitions.  Data_type: string, optional 
.SH Example
