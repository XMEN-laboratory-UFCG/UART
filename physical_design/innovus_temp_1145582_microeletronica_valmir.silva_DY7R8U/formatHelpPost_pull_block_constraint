.SH Name \fBpull_block_constraint\fR \-  Pulls the routing constraints stored on the interface nets of blocks in a design, to their corresponding top-level nets
.SH Syntax \fBpull_block_constraint\fR  [-help]   [-file <report_file_name>]   [-override]   {-all_blocks | -block <list_of_blocks> | -inst <list_of_instances> | -cellview {<list_of_libName_cellName_viewName>}}  
.P Pulls the routing constraints stored on the interface nets of blocks in a design, to their corresponding top-level nets. The pull_block_constraint command uses a two-pass approach to handle conflicting constraints on the same net. In this approach, the  pull_block_constraint command detects block-level and top-level conflicts and reports a warning.
.P If the -override parameter is not specified (non-override mode) and a block-level conflict is detected, no constraints are pulled.
.P If the -override parameter is specified (override mode), pull_block_constraint reports the conflicts but pulls the constraints such that the lower-level net constraints override any constraints that might exist on the top-level nets.. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each pull_block_constraint parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command  man pull_block_constraint  "\fB-cellview {<list_of_libName_cellName_viewName>}\fR" Specifies the list of library, cell, and view names from which the constraints need to be pulled.   "\fB-file <report_file_name>\fR" Specifies the report file name. Given that the standard out report is in the abbreviated format, more details are written out in this mode indicating:
.RS  "*" 2 The lower, and upper level net names, the type of constraints pulled.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 All the associated parameters.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Any conflicts that need to be resolved.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Which constraint were written to a particular net.
.RE   Default: dumpPullInfo.log  "\fB-override\fR" When specified, the lower-level net constraints will override any constraints that might exist on the top-level nets.  Default: off  "\fB-all_blocks\fR" Specifies that constraints with hierarchical scope will be pulled from all blocks in the design.  "\fB-block <list_of_blocks>\fR" Defines the list of block names of the instances in the design for which the constraints with hierarchical scope will be pulled.  "\fB-inst <list_of_instances>\fR" Defines the instances in the design for which the constraints with hierarchical scope will be pulled. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Using the following command, the constraints on the pins in the cellview binded to the block macro of all the instantiations of the block list pll_clock and pwr_monitor will be pulled up to the top-level nets connected to the instance pins.   pull_block_constraint -block {pll_clock pwr_monitor}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Using the following command, the constraints on the pins in the cellview binded to the macro instance I1/I2 will be pulled up to the nets connected to the pins of the instance.   pull_block_constraint -inst {I1/I2}
