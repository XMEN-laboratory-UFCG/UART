.SH Name \fBset_ccopt_property\fR \-  This command is used to set the values of various CCOpt object properties
.SH Syntax \fBset_ccopt_property\fR  [-help]  name  value  [-cell <library_cell_name>]  [-clock_tree <clock_tree_name>]  [-clock_tree_source_group <source_group_name>]  [-delay_corner <delay_corner_name>]  [-flexible_htree <flexibleHtreeName>]  [-help <propertyname>]  [-inst <instance_name>]  [-lib_pin <pin_name>]  [-net <net_name>]  [-net_type leaf | trunk | top]  [-pin <pin_name>]  [-power_domain <domain_name>]  [-skew_group <skew_group_name>]  [-early | -late]  [-rise | -fall]  [-min | -max] 
.P This command is used to set the values of various CCOpt object properties.
.P There are some properties that cannot be set by you because these are read-only properties. This means that you can obtain information about these properties by using the get_ccopt_property command, but you cannot change that information. However, there are writable properties that can be modified. These properties let you configure different aspects of CCOpt behavior. This command is used to set the writable CCOpt properties.
.P To set a property, you need to specify the property name, value, object type, and object pattern. The following syntax are acceptable:
.RS  "*" 2 set_ccopt_property <<name>> <<value>> [-obj <<obj_pattern>>]   "*" 2 set_ccopt_property <<name>> [-obj  <<obj_pattern>>] <<value>>  "*" 2 set_ccopt_property [-obj <<obj_pattern>>] <<name>> <<value>>
.RE
.P Where,
.P <name> is the name of the property to be set
.P value is the new value to which you want to set the property
.P For example, all three commands below are equivalent:
.RS  "*" 2 set_ccopt_property target_skew 0.1 -skew_group sg1   "*" 2 set_ccopt_property target_skew -skew_group sg1  0.1  "*" 2 set_ccopt_property -skew_group sg1 target_skew 0.1

.P For details about the key considerations for setting CCOpt properties, getting properties from Tcl, getting a list of properties and their detailed descriptions, key/value pairs, and defaults for key/value pairs, see the "CCOpt Properties and Configuration" section in Clock Tree Synthesis chapter of the Innovus User Guide. For detailed descriptions about all the public CCOpt properties, see the CCOpt Properties chapter of the Innovus User Guide. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description for the set_ccopt_property command.  For a detailed description of the command, use the man command: man set_ccopt_property.  "\fB-cell <library_cell_name>\fR" Specifies the library cell to which the property applies.   "\fB-clock_tree <clock_tree_name>\fR" Specifies the clock tree to which the property applies.   "\fB  -clock_tree_source_group <source_group>_<name>\fR" Specifies the clock tree source group to which the property applies.   "\fB-delay_corner <delay_corner_name>\fR" Specifies the delay corner to which the property applies.   "\fB-early\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the early signal.   "\fB-fall\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the fall signal.   "\fB-flexible_htree <flexibleHtreeName>\fR" Specifies the flexible H-tree to which the property applies.   "\fB-help <propertyname>\fR" Provides help for the specified property. Other options are ignored.   "\fB-inst <instance_name>\fR" Specifies the instance to which the property applies. This parameter enables properties to be added to instances.  "\fB-late\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the late signal.    "\fB-lib_pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the library pin to which the property applies.   "\fB-max\fR" Specifies the maximum value for the property.    "\fB-min\fR" Specifies the minimum value for the property.   "\fB<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the property to be set.   "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the net level to which the property applies.   "\fB-net_type <leaf | trunk | top>\fR" Specifies the net type to which the property applies. It could be leaf net, trunk net, or top net.   "\fB-pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the pin to which the property applies.   "\fB-power_domain <domain_name>\fR" Specifies the power domain to which the property applies.   "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies that the property applies to the rise signal.   "\fB-skew_group <skew_group_name>\fR" Specifies the skew group to which the property applies.   "\fB<value>\fR" Specifies the new value to which to set the property. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following commands will cause all 'trunk' type clock tree nets to be routed using route_type 'CTS_2w2s' and all 'leaf' type clock tree nets to be routed using route_type 'CTS_1w2s':  set_ccopt_property route_type -net_type trunk CTS_2w2s  set_ccopt_property route_type -net_type leaf CTS_1w2s  "*" 2  The following command will cause all 'trunk' clock tree nets for clock trees matching pattern MAIN* to be routed with route_type 'NDR_xtra_wide':  set_ccopt_property route_type -net_type trunk -clock_tree MAIN* NDR_xtra_wide  Note: For details regarding the usage of the route_type property, see the CCOpt Properties chapter in the InnovusUser Guide.   "*" 2 The following command sets the net type to leaf:  set_ccopt_property -net_type leaf   "*" 2 The example below specifies that clock tree synthesis should use inverters when balancing clock tree ct1:  set_ccopt_property use_inverters -clock_tree ct1 true  "*" 2 Some properties are global, and others are specific to a particular object. Some examples are provided below.
.RS  "*" 2 The adjacent_rows_legal property is global. This means that you can set this property using the following command:  set_ccopt_property adjacent_rows_legal true/false   "*" 2 Some properties can be set on particular objects. For example, minimum number of transitive fanout for a net to be routed as a top net can be set for a clock tree:  set_ccopt_property -clock_tree clk500m routing_top_min_fanout 10000   "*" 2 Some other properties can be set per object AND per early/late path. For example, the insertion_delay property can be set in the following manner:  set_ccopt_property insertion_delay 0.8 -pin pinA -early  set_ccopt_property insertion_delay 0.7 -pin pinA -late
