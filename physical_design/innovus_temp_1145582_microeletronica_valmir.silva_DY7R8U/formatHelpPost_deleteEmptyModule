.TH deleteEmptyModule  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBdeleteEmptyModule\fR \-  Deletes modules and their instantiations
.SH Syntax \fBdeleteEmptyModule\fR  [-help]   [-deleteEmpty1801Modules]  
.P Deletes modules and their instantiations. Modules and their instantiations are deleted if the following criteria are met:
.RS  "*" 2 The netlist is unique
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The module does not contain any instances, or the module contains only unconnected instances of other empty modules
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The instances of the module are not connected to other instances or ports
.RE
.P The deleteEmptyModule command does not delete used empty modules, where there exists at least one connected instance of the empty cell. For example, black boxes typically are empty, but they are still connected to other instances or ports. 
.P At times, the lowest hierarchy is connected to the immediate higher-level hierarchy but the module is dangling and should be deleted. You can delete the dangling modules by first deleting the dangling ports followed by the deletion of the empty modules as given below:
.P deleteDanglingPort
.P deleteEmptyModule
.P Note: A design can contain empty modules for different reasons. Modules can become empty due to optimization processes. A design also can contain MCPO modules that were read in with the netlist. To convert empty modules into special leaf cells when reading in the netlist, see the setImportMode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each deleteEmptyModule.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man deleteEmptyModule  "\fB-deleteEmpty1801Modules  \fR" Deletes empty UPF modules.
