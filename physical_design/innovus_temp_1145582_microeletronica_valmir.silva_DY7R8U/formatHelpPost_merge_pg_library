.SH Name \fBmerge_pg_library\fR \-  Specifies to merge power-grid libraries
.SH Syntax  \fBmerge_pg_library\fR  [-help ]  [-force {true | false}]  -library_list_file <file_name>  [-library_prefix <prefix>]  [-merge_single_voltage_pgvs {true |false}]  [-output <directory> <_name>]  [-remove_tech{true | false}]  [-validate_rail_merge {true | false}] 
.P Specifies to merge power-grid libraries. Using this command, you can merge multiple same-type power-grid libraries into one consolidated power-grid library.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB -help   \fR" Outputs the command usage.   "\fB-force {true | false}\fR" Specifies to force merge PGVs with different resistivity and layers. It uses the technology information of the first library. If multiple tech-only PGVs are specified, it will take the first tech-only PGV definition and the first cell definition. If you are merging a tech-only PGV with other PGVs, it will keep the tech-only technology definition and the first cell definition.  The default value of the parameter is false.  "\fB-library_list_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the file containing the list of libraries.  "\fB-library_prefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies a prefix for the generated power-grid library.  "\fB-merge_single_voltage_pgvs {true |false}\fR" Specifies to merge all the single voltage PGVs into a multi-voltage PGV for better handling of the library characterization flow. This parameter is used in a scenario when you have generated multiple PGVs for different voltages, instead of generating a single multi-voltage PGV that has voltage-dependent capacitance.  The default value of the parameter is false.  "\fB-output <directory_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the output directory in which power-grid libraries are created. The default is the current working directory.  Note: If you specify both -output <output_dir> and -library_prefix <prefix> parameters, the command generates the PGV in the output_dir directory with PGV name prefix.cl.  "\fB-remove_tech{true | false}\fR" Specifies to remove technology dependency from the specified or merged library. The newly created library will not contain the technology information.  The default value of the parameter is false.  "\fB-validate_rail_merge {true | false}\fR" Specifies to validate the merged PGV in the same way as done when merging PGV during rail analysis. When this parameter is specified, the log file reports error, warning, and info messages if the tool finds any issues during PGV merging. The parameter allows you to check the PGV merging issues as reported during rail analysis, without having to run the full design.  -validate_rail_merge is used only for validation purpose, and the merged PGV is not to be used for analysis. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command merges the power-grid libraries specified in the merge_lib.list file into one consolidated power-grid library:  merge_pg_library -library_list_file "merge_lib.list" -output
./ -library_prefix "new_merged"  The content of merge_lib.list file is:  library1.cl  library2.cl  library3.cl
