.SH Name \fBreport_ccopt_skew_groups\fR \-  This command displays information about skew and insertion delay in skew groups
.SH Syntax \fBreport_ccopt_skew_groups\fR  [-help]  [-delay_corners {<list_of_delay_corners>} | -views {<list_of_views>}]  [-exclude_pin_insertion_delay]  [-exclude_source_latency]  [-file <file_name>]  [-from <sources>]  [-histograms]  [-no_invalidate]  [-paths <number_of_paths>]  [-skew_groups <list_of_skew_groups |>-include_reporting_only_skew_groups]  [-skip_timing_update]  [-summarize_stage_depth <cell_type_list>]  [-summary]  [-tcl_list]  [-through <list_of_pins>]  [-to <list_of_sinks>]  [-early | -late ]  
.P This command displays information about skew and insertion delay in skew groups. By default, the report_ccopt_skew_groups command displays two summary tables at the beginning of the report. The first table lists the insertion delays and skews (along with target values) for each skew group in each timing corner. The second table lists the start and end points of the min and max paths in the skew group. The remainder of the report contains detailed min and max path information for each skew group, in each timing corner.
.P You can customize the columns included in the skew group report by configuring set_ccopt_property skew_group_report_columns.
.P You can customize the size of the histogram ranges by configuring set_ccopt_property skew_group_report_histogram_bin_size. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_ccopt_skew_groups parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man  report_ccopt_skew_groups.   "\fB-delay_corners <list_of_delay_corners>        \fR" Specifies that the report will be restricted to the specified delay corners.  Note: The -delay_corners and -views parameters are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-early\fR" Specifies that only the early half of the delay corners will be reported.   "\fB-exclude_pin_insertion_delay\fR" Specifies that pin insertion delay should be excluded from the report.   "\fB-exclude_source_latency\fR" Specifies that source latency of the clocks should be excluded from the report.   "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Specifies that a copy of  the contents of the report will be saved to the specified file name.   "\fB-from <sources>\fR" Specifies the list of sources of the skew group to consider for the report. If specified, only paths beginning at one of the sources specified will be reported.  "\fB-histograms \fR" Specifies that histograms of key information will be displayed.   "\fB-include_reporting_only_skew_groups\fR" When specified, the report additionally includes the reporting-only skew groups. A reporting-only skew group is a skew group whose constrains property is set to none. Such a skew group imposes no clock balancing constraint and is not considered by CTS.  By default, the reporting-only skew groups are not included in the report. If a reporting-only skew group is explicitly specified using the -skew_groups parameter, then that skew group is always included in the report output.  Note: The -include_reporting_only_skew_groups and -skew_groups parameters are mutually exclusive. If both these parameters are specified together, the software errors out.  "\fB-late\fR" Specifies that only the late half of the delay corners will be reported.   "\fB-no_invalidate\fR" Specifies that the timing engine should not be invalidated. The timing engine is used to calculate the timing data that is displayed in the report. By default, this is invalidated when you generate the report, so all the timing data is recalculated. This increases the time taken to generate the report. Use the -no_invalidate option to reuse the existing timing data for the report.   "\fB-paths <number_of_paths>\fR" Specifies the number of paths to report on for each timing corner.  Default: 1  "\fB-skew_groups <list_of_skew_groups>\fR" Restricts the report to the specified skew groups. By default, all defined skew groups are displayed.   "\fB-skip_timing_update\fR" Specifies that the timing engine should not be updated. The timing engine is used to calculate the timing data that is displayed in the report. By default, when you generate the report, the timing data is recalculated. This increases the time taken to generate the report. Specify this parameter to skip calculation of timing data.   "\fB-summarize_stage_depth <cell_type_list>\fR" Specifies that the command will consider the number of cells of the specified type(s) in the tree, instead of considering delay while reporting. Possible values are buffer, inverter, logic, clock_gate, and generator. You can also specify * to include all cell types.  The following command shows a report of the skew groups with counts of the buffers and inverters, instead of the delay.  report_ccopt_skew_groups -summarize_stage_depth {buffer inverter}  Note: The * setting is not used in combination with any other cell type. For example, the below is not a valid setting.  -summarize_stage_depth {* buffer}  "\fB-summary\fR" Specifies that just the summary table should be displayed in the report.   "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Specifies that the report will be created as Tcl data instead of a text report.   "\fB-through <list_of_pins>\fR" Provides a list of pin objects representing points that all # paths reported must pass through. The paths must pass through one of the pins specified.  "\fB-to <list_of_sinks>\fR" Provides a list of pin objects representing all the sinks of skew groups to consider for the report. If specified, only paths terminating at one of the sinks specified will be reported.  "\fB-views {<list_of_views>}\fR" Restricts the report to the delay corners associated with the specified views.  Note: The -delay_corners and -views parameters are mutually exclusive.

.P Note:
.RS  "*" 2 The Timing Corner column specifies the delay corner, timing check type (setup or hold) and derate type (early or late) reporting conditions for the skew group. All *early corners are reported using early clock derates and all *late corners are reported using late clock derates. A skew group row with no timing column specification is using the timing corner specified above it.    "*" 2 The "Skew Target Type" column shows either "explicit", auto computed or ignored.  Only the timing corner(s) with "explicit" or "auto computed" are actually considered during clock tree construction, and only these corners will have a numeric skew target in the Target Skew column. Generally, only timing corners with late derates for a delay corner are activated for clock tree construction.    "*" 2 The "Skew window occupancy" column is defined as the percentage of sinks in the skew group that fall within the user-defined skew target. It is computed by finding a min and max latency window in which the largest proportion of sinks fall. The intent of this column is to indicate, when the skew target is not met, some measure of how badly it has not been met by showing the largest proportion of sinks that occupy the desired skew target.
