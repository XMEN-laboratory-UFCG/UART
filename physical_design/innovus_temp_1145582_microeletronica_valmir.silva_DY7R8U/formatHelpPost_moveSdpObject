.TH moveSdpObject  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBmoveSdpObject\fR \-  Moves specified SDP objects before or after the specified reference object
.SH Syntax \fBmoveSdpObject\fR  [-help]   <moveObject>{<objName> <s>}  {-before <refObject> | -after <refObject>} 
.P Moves specified SDP objects before or after the specified reference object. Use this command to:
.RS  "*" 2 Move a subgroup or member to a different position within the current SDP group  "*" 2 Move a subgroup or member to a different group to improve congestion and/or timing.  "*" 2 Move multiple instances, SDP groups, or a mix of instances and SDP groups to the specified location.
.RE
.P In the traditional SDP flow, this command can be used while defining SDP constraints or while analyzing SDP alignment. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each moveSdpObject parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man moveSdpObject.  "\fB-after <refObject>\fR" Indicates that the specified SDP objects should be moved after the reference object:
.RS  "*" 2 For column with justifyBy SW/SE, after means the specified SDP objects are placed above the reference object.
.RE   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.RS  "*" 2 For column with justifyBy NW/NE, after means the specified SDP objects are placed below the reference object.
.RE   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.RS  "*" 2 For row with justifyBy SW/NW, after means that the specified SDP objects are placed on the right side of the reference object.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 For row with justifyBy SE/NE, after means that the specified SDP objects are placed on the left side of the reference object.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE   "\fB-before <refObject>\fR" Indicates that the specified SDP objects should be moved before the reference object:
.RS  "*" 2 For column with justifyBy SW/SE, before means the specified SDP objects are placed below the reference object.
.RE   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.RS  "*" 2 For column with justifyBy NW/NE, before means the specified SDP objects are placed above the reference object.
.RE   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.RS  "*" 2 For row with justifyBy SW/NW, before means that the specified SDP objects are placed on the left side of the reference object.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 For row with justifyBy SE/NE, before means that the specified SDP objects are placed on the right side of the reference object.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE   "\fB<moveObject> {<objNames>}\fR" Specifies the names of the SDP objects to be moved. The objects can be SDP groups, instances, or a mix of both.  If multiple SDP objects are specified, the option works as follows:
.RS  "*" 2  If both the objects being moved and the reference object are instances, the instances being moved will become members of the SDP group to which the reference instance belongs.  "*" 2 If both the objects being moved and the reference object are SDP groups, the SDP groups being moved will become members of the SDP group to which the reference SDP group belongs.   "*" 2  If the objects being moved are SDP groups and the reference object is an instance, the SDP groups being moved will become members of the SDP group to which the reference instance belongs.  "*" 2 If the objects being moved are instances and the reference object is an SDP group, the instances being moved will become members of the SDP group to which the reference SDP group belongs.   "*" 2  If the objects being moved are a mix of instances and SDP groups and the reference object is an instance, the instances and SDP groups being moved will become members of the SDP group to which the reference instance belongs and the result is based on the input sequence.  "*" 2  If the objects being moved are a mix of instances and SDP groups and the reference object is an SDP group, the instances and SDP groups being moved will become members of the SDP group to which the reference SDP group belongs and the result is based on the input sequence.

.RS  "*" 2 The following command moves the SDP group sdpGrp1, which is an SDP group of type row with justifyBy SE, to the right side of the group sdpGrp3:   moveSdpObject sdpGrp1 -before sdpGrp3 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command moves the SDP group SDP_col145, which is an SDP group of typecolumn with justifyBy NE, to the position below SDP_col170.   moveSdpObject SDP_col145 -after SDP_col170   "*" 2 Consider the SDP group structure given below:  column group1 {     justifyBy SW       row selInstGrp_9 {         justifyBy SW          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/EXECUTE_INST/ar1_reg_1          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/EXECUTE_INST/ar1_reg_13 orient MX          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/EXECUTE_INST/ar1_reg_12          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/EXECUTE_INST/ar1_reg_3          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/EXECUTE_INST/ar0_reg_12 orient R0          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/EXECUTE_INST/ar0_reg_13 orient MX          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/PORT_BUS_MACH_INST/data_out_reg_8          inst DTMF_INST/TDSP_CORE_INST/EXECUTE_INST/ar1_reg_14       }
