.TH report_annotated_assertions  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreport_annotated_assertions\fR \-  Reports information for annotated assertions, set using the set_load or set_annotated_transition command, according to the specified assertion type
.SH Syntax  \fBreport_annotated_assertions\fR  -type {load | transition}   [-list_annotated]   [-list_non_annotated]   [-view <viewName>]   [-max_lines <number>]   [-min | -max | -min_max]   <object_list>  [{> | >>} <file_name>]  
.P Reports information for annotated assertions, set using the set_load or set_annotated_transition command, according to the specified assertion type. You can select load or transition reporting.
.P Note: The report_annotated_assertions command is now obsolete. This command will continue to be supported in the current release, but will be removed in the next major release of the software. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB{> | >>} <file_name>\fR" Writes the report to the specified file name.  When specified with >, writes the report to the specified file name. If the file already exists, the software overwrites it.  When specified with >>, writes the report to the specified filename. If the file already exists, the software concatenates the report to the end of the file.  "\fB-list_annotated\fR" Lists the detailed information for the specified assertion types.  "\fB-list_non_annotated\fR" Lists information for non-annotated assertions.  "\fB-min | -max | -min_max\fR" Specifies to report minimum, maximum, or both values of the specified assertion type.  When input assertions are applied using both -min and -max parameters, you can specify the -min_max parameter to report both the assertion values. In this case, you do not need to specify this command twice, that is, separately with -min and -max parameters.  Default: max  "\fB-max_lines <number>\fR" Controls the number of output lines reported by -list_annotated or -list_non_annotated parameter. By default, the specified net, pin, or port names are reported.  "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the list of nets, pins, or ports to be reported.  "\fB-type {load | transition}\fR" Specifies the assertion type, load or transition, to be reported.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Reports the annotations for the specified analysis view.  In multi-mode multi-corner timing analysis mode, annotations are reported for the specified mode or corner.
