.SH Name \fBtiming_path_based_exhaustive_enable_design_coverage\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_path_based_exhaustive_enable_design_coverage\fR   {true | false}
.P Default: false
.P Enables exhaustive path-based analysis (PBA) to automatically pick up and analyze all the violating endpoints in the design, irrespective of the specified maximum paths.
.P When set to true, exhaustive PBA analysis automatically picks up and analyzes the violating design endpoints instead of N endpoints (specified with the report_timing -max_paths parameter). After analyzing the violating endpoints, the software reports the top N worst endpoints - depending on the specified value of N.
.P When set to false, exhaustive PBA analysis restricts analysis (using the -max_paths parameter) to the specified number of N endpoints. 
.P Note: When this global variable is enabled, there may be an increase in run time because the software will analyze all the violating endpoints and analysis will not be restricted to the specified N endpoints.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
