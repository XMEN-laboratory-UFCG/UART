.P Modifies the parameters of an existing delay calculation corner object. You can use the update_delay_corner command to add or change attribute values for an existing delay calculation corner object, or for an existing power domain definition.
.P You can update a delay calculation corner object before the multi-mode multi-corner definition file is loaded into the design, or after. However, after the software processes the file, any change to an existing object when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner mode results in the timing, delay calculation, and RC data being reset.
.P You also can use the update_delay_corner command to add a power domain definition to the specified delay calculation corner. Instances contained within an MSMV power domain often require a different library or operating condition that used for the default power domain. Power domain definitions within a delay calculation corner object can be used to assign specific libraries and PVT settings per power domain.
.P Note: Use separate delay calculation corners to define major PVT corner differences. Use the -early_* and -late_* parameters within a single delay calculation corner to control on-chip-variation.
.P The -early_* and -late_* parameters can be specified separately, to update a delay corner object with early or late information. If you only specify one of the -early_* or -late_* parameters, the software uses the original information pointer in place of the missing early/late parameter.
.P For example, if you initially created a delay corner object using:
.P create_delay_corner   -library_set libsNominal 
...
.P If you specify update_delay_corner -early_library_set libsEarly, the software actually uses:
.P update_delay_corner   -early_library_set libsEarly   -late_library_set libsNominal
.P Use this command after creating at least one delay calculation corner (create_delay_corner). 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-early_estimated_worst_irDrop_factor <percent>\fR" Specifies the early voltage derating factor.   When this parameter is specified, the software performs delay calculations using the voltage = nomVolt * (1 - value).  Default: 0.0  "\fB-early_irdrop_data <files_or_directories>\fR" Specifies the IR drop files or directories to apply when calculating the early arrival times at a single delay corner.  "\fB-early_irdrop_file <list_of_files>\fR" Specifies the list of IR drop files to apply when calculating early arrival times at a single power domain.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.

This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Default: Each library in the early library set uses its own default operating condition.  "\fB-early_opcond_library <libName>\fR" Specifies the internal library name for the library in which the early operating condition is defined. This is not the library file name.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Default: The software searches the early library set for the specified operating condition (-early_opcond), starting with the master library.  "\fB-early_rc_corner <rcCornerObj>\fR" Specifies the RC corner object to associate with the early corner object.  "\fB-early_temp_file <tempName>\fR" Specifies the name of the temperature file for temperature aware delay calculation for early corner.

"\fB-irdrop_file <list_of_files>\fR" Specifies the list of IR drop files to apply to both early and late delay calculation for this power domain object.  This parameter is used primarily to configure single-corner or Best-Case Worst-Case (BC-WC) analysis modes.  Note: This parameter is obsolete and will be removed in a future release. To ensure compatibility with future releases, you should update your scripts.  "\fB-late_estimated_worst_irDrop_factor <percent>\fR" Specifies the late voltage derating factor.   When this parameter is specified, the software performs delay calculations using the voltage = nomVolt * (1 - value).  Default: 0.0  "\fB-late_irdrop_data <files_or_directories>\fR" Specifies the IR drop files or directories to apply when calculating the late arrival times at a single delay corner.  "\fB-late_irdrop_file <list_of_files>\fR" Specifies the list of IR drop files to apply when calculating late arrival times at a single power domain.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Note: This parameter is obsolete and will be removed in a future release. To ensure compatibility with future releases, you should update your scripts.  "\fB-late_library_set <libSetName>\fR" Specifies the library set to associate with this delay corner object for calculating late arrival times for this power domain.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  "\fB-late_opcond <opcondName>\fR" Specifies the operating condition to use for calculating late arrival times for this power domain.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Default: Each library in the late library set uses its own default operating condition.  "\fB-late_opcond_library <libName>\fR" Specifies the internal library name for the library in which the late operating condition is defined. This is not the library file name.  This parameter is used primarily when configuring the multi-mode multi-corner environment for on-chip-variation (OCV) analysis.  Default: The software searches the late library set for the specified operating condition (-late_opcond), starting with the master library.  "\fB-late_temp_file <tempName>\fR" Specifies the name of the temperature file for temperature aware delay calculation for late corner.  "\fB-late_rc_corner <rcCornerObj>\fR" Specifies the RC corner object to associate with the late corner object.  "\fB-library_set <libSetName>\fR" Specifies the library set to associate with the power domain. All of the cells and macros in the power domain get their timing and power information from these libraries.  This parameter is used primarily to configure single-corner or Best-Case Worst-Case (BC-WC) analysis modes.  "\fB-name <dcCornerObj>\fR" Specifies the delay calculation corner to which to add the power domain definition, or to which to update the delay corner or power domain attribute values.  "\fB-opcond <OpcondName>\fR" Specifies the operating condition to use for the power domain.  This parameter is used primarily to configure single-corner or Best-Case Worst-Case (BC-WC) analysis modes.  Default: Each library in the library set uses its own default operating condition.

"\fB-power_domain <powerDomainName>\fR" Specifies the name of the power domain to add to the delay calculation corner. This name must match the name of a power domain specified in the power domain file.  Note: This parameter is required for all the designs that use power domains and should be specified for each delay corner in the MMMC file.  "\fB-rc_corner <rcCornerObj>\fR" Specifies the new RC corner object to associate with this delay corner.  "\fB-si_enabled {true | false}\fR" Controls signal integrity (SI) analysis.  When set to true, the analysis of all MMMC views will include SI analysis by default. You can use this parameter to further determine which analysis views receive SI analysis and which do not.  When this parameter is set to false on a delay corner, the software will disable SI analysis for all the views that reference that corner. By default (or when this parameter is set to true), SI analysis is computed for all the views related to that corner - whenever SI is globally enabled. (The global control of signal integrity (SI) analysis is determined by the setDelayCalMode -SIAware setting.)  "\fB-supply_set <supplySetName>\fR" Specifies the name of the supply set to add to the delay calculation corner.   "\fB-temp_file <tempName>\fR" Specifies the name of the temperature file for temperature aware delay calculation for single corner.
