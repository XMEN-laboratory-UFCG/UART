.P Loading power/rail analysis results into GUI.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each read_power_rail_results parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man read_power_rail_results.  "\fB-cell_library { <library1>.cl}\fR" Specifies the single cell library that is required to load the state directory. The specified cell library must contain the technology layer information that is required to load the state directory. Therefore, you do not need to load all cell libraries used during analysis.   "\fB-custom_value_inst_file_1 <file>\fR" Specifies the name of the custom value instance file (CVIF). This file can be used to display a user-specified instance voltage file in GUI.    The format of the CVIF file is:  <value1>    <instancename1>  <value2>    <instancename2> 
....  where, <value1> and <value2> are voltage values mapping to the specified instance.  You can use the cvil argument of the set_power_rail_display -plot command parameter to view the EIV map in GUI.  "\fB-data_type {rail | all}\fR" Controls the type of data to be loaded in the GUI. The possible arguments of this parameter are:
.RS  "*" 2 rail - Loads only the rail analysis results.  "*" 2 all - Loads both the power and rail analysis results. This is the default value.
.RE   "\fB-detail_delta_temperature_file <file>\fR" Specifies the name of the detailed wire-based delta temperature file from self-heating analysis.  "\fB-die_instance_name <dieinstname>\fR" Specifies the name of the die whose results you need to view. This parameter is only applicable to the multi-die analysis flow (set_rail_analysis_mode -die_mode multi-die).  The -die_instance_name parameter must be specified with the -rail_directory parameter (multi-die rail directory).  "\fB               -effective_resistance_file  <file>\fR" Specifies the result file from effective resistance analysis (only instance-based result is supported). When the rail analysis plot type effr is selected and a result file is specified, the layout shows effective resistance analysis result for each instance.  Note: Currently, this feature only supports loading one net at a time.  "\fB-enable_plots <plot_names>\fR" Specifies the list of power or rail plots names that are to be loaded.   "\fB-esd_directory <dir>\fR" Specifies the ESD analysis directory.   "\fB-esd_rj<dir>\fR" Specifies the name of the directory where the current density/EM results generated by a previous ESD analysis run reside. This parameter allows you to selectively load the required EM result directory if there are multiple ESD EM result directories under the ESD directory.  You must either load the rail directory (-rail_directory) before running this command, or specify the rail directory with the -esd_rj parameter.  "\fB-instances<instancenames>\fR" Specifies a list of instances to load in the GUI. This parameter loads only those partitions that include the specified instances. The -instances parameter allows you to analyze parts of the designs, thereby reducing the loading time and memory footprint.  The -instances parameter is applicable to the Voltus-XP flow only.  "\fB-instance_delta_temperature_file <file>\fR" Specifies the name of the instance-based delta temperature file from self-heating analysis. This is the device instance temperature.  "\fB-instance_voltage_method { best | worst | avg | worstavg }\fR" Loads the instance voltage data for the specified EIV computing method. If this parameter is not specified (default), the instance voltage results for all the four methods are loaded.   "\fB-instance_voltage_window { timing | whole }\fR" Loads the instance voltage data for the selected EIV window. If this parameter is not specified (default), the instance voltage results for both the timing and switching windows, and the entire rail simulation are loaded.   "\fB-nets <net_names>\fR" Loads only the specified nets in the domain-based state directory to the GUI. If this parameter is not specified with the -rail_directory parameter, all the nets will be loaded.   "\fB-power_db <file>\fR" Specifies the power database file. This file was created by using the -create_binary_db option of the  set_power_analysis_mode command.  "\fB-power_directory <power_output_directory>\fR" Specifies to load the power analysis results and display the power plots without loading the rail analysis results.   "\fB-physical_db<dir_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the hierarchical design directory to be loaded to the GUI along with the rail analysis results.   "\fB-profiling_power_file <file>\fR" Specifies to display the tile-based power density results generated from the vector profiling flow.   "\fB-reset\fR" Frees the loaded analysis state directory or power database from the memory.   "\fB-rail_directory             <dir>\fR" Specifies the rail analysis directory. You can load all the domain results by selecting the automatically generated analysis directory under the output directory (<domain>_<temp>_<dynamic/avg>_#), or load individual nets by going one level further and selecting the net directory.  "\fB-sem_db <fil>e\fR" Specifies to read the signal electromigration data from the specified database file generated by the verifyACLimit -report_db command parameter.   "\fB-short_file <file>\fR" Specifies the path to the short violations report (voltus_short.report)
. This file is generated using the  set_rail_analysis_mode -report_shorts true command parameter, and is located in the work directory.   "\fB-thermal_file <filename>.txt\fR" Specifies to load the tile-based temperature map file generated by Sigrity Celsius to be used for both power calculation and IR drop analysis.  The following is an example of reading the thermal map file:  read_power_rail_results -rail_directory output/static_rail/core_25C_avg_1/ -thermal_file output/power_map_by_layer.txt  set_power_rail_display -plot thermal  "\fB-tile_delta_temperature_file <file>\fR" Specifies the name of the tile-based delta temperature file of self-heating analysis. This is the worst instance temperature among all wire segments in a tile. This is also layer-based. The FEOL or cell layer is used to show the device instance temperature.  "\fB-tile_thermal_config_file<filename>\fR" Specifies to load the configuration file that contains the mapping between the hierarchical levels with corresponding layer-based temperature map files generated by Celsius (system-level thermal analysis tool). When specified, you can view tile-based temperature distribution for each layer of the chip.  The following is the format and example of the configuration file:  <hierarchy>    <block name>    <X_tile_no,Y_tile_no>  <LEF/DEF Flip/Rotation>       <temperature map>  TOP           DIE            0,0            N                 /thermal_data/DIE_TemperatureMap  TOP/IP1       IP1            25,50          N                 /thermal_data/IP1_TemperatureMap  TOP/IP1/B1    B1             50,125         N                 /thermal_data/B1_TemperatureMap  TOP/IP1/B2    B2             200,125        S                 /thermal_data/B2_TemperatureMap  This is a mandatory parameter for the tile_thermal plot when loading hierarchical temperature maps.  "\fB-top_cell_name<topcell_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the top module or top cell name to be loaded. This parameter must be specified with the -physical_db parameter.
