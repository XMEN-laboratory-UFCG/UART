.SH Name \fBsetCompressLevel\fR \-  Specifies the compression level to use when compressing large data files
.SH Syntax \fBsetCompressLevel\fR <value> 
.P Specifies the compression level to use when compressing large data files. A higher compression level creates a more compressed file, but at the cost of speed. A lower compression level creates a less compressed file, but speeds up the process. By default, the software uses the gzip default value, that is 6, which results in high compression at the cost of speed. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each setCompressLevel parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setCompressLevel  "\fB<value>\fR" Specifies the compression level to use when compressing files.  You can specify -1 or values between 1 and 9, where:  1 Creates the least compressed files at the highest speed.  9 Creates the most compressed files at the lowest speed.  -1 Returns to the gzip default value, that is 6 (Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION).  Data_type: int, required 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the highest compression level and results in the most compressed data:  setCompressLevel 9
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command resets the compression level to the gzip default, that is 6.  setCompressLevel -1
