.SH Name \fBadd_clock_tree_source_group_roots\fR \-  This command updates the design and clock tree specification to create a multiple-tree "source group" below the specified driving root pin
.SH Syntax \fBadd_clock_tree_source_group_roots\fR  [-help]  -cell <driverCell>  [-locations {{x1 y1} {x2 y2}...}]  -name <sourceGroupName>  -pin <rootPin>[-grid {columns rows} [[-adjust_grid_for_aspect_ratio]   [-grid_rect {lx ly ux uy}]   [-grid_search_area {width height}]   [-grid_exclusion_rects {{lx1 ly1 ux1 uy1} {lx2 ly2 ux2 uy2}...}]]]
.P This command updates the design and clock tree specification to create a multiple-tree "source group" below the specified driving root pin. A source group is a set of multiple, logically equivalent, clock trees that drive a collection of clock tree sinks. The actual allocation of sinks to specific source group roots is chosen during clock tree synthesis.
.P This command performs the following tasks:
.RS  "*" 2 Inserts the instances that will become the clock tree roots into the netlist. Their input pins will be driven by the root pin and the fanout originally driven by the root pin will be rewired to the output of a single root instance.  "*" 2 Defines clock trees at the outputs of each of the newly inserted root instances.  "*" 2 Defines a clock source group to combine the clock trees.
.RE
.P You can insert a grid of tap buffers and also omit a tap buffer at grid points that are blocked. For this, you can specify grid coordinates, a two-value pair {x y}, that place the source group driver at that location. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help          \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each add_clock_tree_source_group_roots parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man add_clock_tree_source_group_roots.   "\fB-adjust_grid_for_aspect_ratio\fR"  "\fBWhen specified, exchanges rows and columns to match the aspect ratio.\fR"  "\fB-cell <driverCell>\fR" Specifies the buffer cell to use for new source group # roots (libCell/ptnCell).  This is a required parameter.  "\fB-grid {columns rows}\fR" Specifies a grid of target locations. By default, the command attempts to create a full grid consisting of columns and rows. However, if a particular grid target point falls within an exclusion rectangle, specified using the -grid_exclusion_rects parameter, then that grid point will be skipped. If the -adjust_grid_for_aspect_ratio parameter is specified, the columns and rows will be swapped if doing so better matches the aspect ratio of the grid rectangle area.  Note: The -grid and -locations parameters can be used together. For example, you can specify a grid, and then use -locations to add a few additional taps in specific floor-plan locations.  "\fB-grid_exclusion_rects {{lx1 ly1 ux1 uy1} {lx2 ly2 ux2 uy2}...}\fR" Provides the coordinates of rectangular areas that should not contain source group roots. Any grids that fall within the exclusion rectangle will be ignored.  "\fB-grid_rect {lx ly ux uy}\fR" Specifies the area that the grid should cover. This parameter provides the overall rectangle intended to be driven by the taps requested by the -grid parameter.  Note: This parameter does not specify the bounding box of the grid taps. Basically the overall -grid_rect rectangle is cut up into m x n smaller rectangles, and a tap is targeted at the center of each smaller rectangle. to understand more clearly, consider the below example.  If you have -grid {2 2} and -grid_rect {0 0 100 100}, the corresponding target locations will be {{25 25} {25 75} {75 25} {75 75}}.  This is different than if the -grid_rect were the bounding box of tap locations, in which case it would be {{0 0} {0 100} {100 0} {100 100}}).  "\fB-grid_search_area {width height}\fR" Specifies the size of the search area around each grid point.   "\fB-locations {{x1 y1} {x2 y2}...}\fR" Specifies a list of (x,y) locations for the new roots that are to be created. The specified roots are inserted at the nearest legal location.  Note: This parameter takes a list of points, not rectangles. A specified point will be taken as a tap target location, and the software will search for the nearest legal location. If the -grid_search_area {width height} parameter is specified, the search will be limited to the points specified using the -grid parameter and not points specified using the -locations parameter. If it is not specified, the software will search as far as needed to find a legal location for a tap. If a legal location cannot be found, either within the specified search area, or anywhere in the floorplan, the tap will be added at the target location and not legalized. If all taps can be inserted at legal locations, they will be set to locked for CTS placement status. If one or more taps cannot be legalized, the command will print a warning and all taps will be left in simple placed status.  Note: The behavior when a tap cannot be legalized, and for whether taps are locked applies to all taps created by this command - from the -grid and/or -locations parameters.   "\fB-name <prefix>\fR" Specifies the name of the source group to be created for the roots. The name should be unique. The multi-tap roots will be named using this string as a prefix.  For example, sourceGroupName_0, sourceGroupName_1..sourceGroupName_n.   Note:
.RS  "*" 2 The skew group name will be <<prefix>>_skew_group.  "*" 2 The clock tree name for a tap will be <<prefix>>_<index>, and <<prefix>>_<index>_inst for the corresponding cell instance.
.RE   This is a required parameter.   "\fB-pin <rootPin>\fR" Specifies the name of the root pin that will drive the multi-tap root inputs. The pin must be an output pin and must drive a net.  The entire clock structure, including clock gates, flops, and so on that are to be driven by the multi-tap roots should originally be connected below this pin. If there are multiple drivers on the root net, any one of their output pins may be specified as the -pin parameter.  This is a required parameter.
