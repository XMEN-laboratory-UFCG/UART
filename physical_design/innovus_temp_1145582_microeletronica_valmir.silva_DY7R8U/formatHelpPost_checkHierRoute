.SH Name \fBcheckHierRoute\fR \-  Checks and reports hierarchy violations for nets in the specified partitions
.SH Syntax \fBcheckHierRoute\fR  [-help]  [-ptn {<ptnName> | <ptnList>}]   [-outFile <outputFileName>] 
.P Checks and reports hierarchy violations for nets in the specified partitions.
.P The following conditions for hierarchy violations are checked:
.RS  "*" 2 Intra-partition nets: All routes of this net should be within the partition boundary.  "*" 2 Pure-Top nets: All routes of this net should be outside the partition boundary or touch the partition boundary from outside.  "*" 2 Inter-partition nets: At least one route of this net must cross the partition boundary at partition pin. No route should cross the partition boundary at any other point.
.RE
.P Note: You can use this command to check for hierarchy violations before you push down the signal routes with the partition -pushRoute command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each checkHierRoute parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man checkHierRoute.  "\fB-ptn {<ptnName> | <ptnList>}\fR" Report the nets that violate the hierarchy with respect to the specified partition(s).  Default: The command checks the hierarchy violations for nets on all partitions.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-outFile <outputFileName>\fR" Prints the details of net-wise violations in the specified file.  Default: By default, the name of the file is hier.rpt.  Data_type: string, optional 
.SH Examples of hierarchy violation conditions:
.P The following are examples of hierarchy violation conditions:
.RS  "*" 2 If wires of a inter-partition net, are crossing the partition boundary at a place other than the corresponding pin shape.  "*" 2 If wires of a inter-partition net, are crossing the partition boundary at multiple places.  "*" 2 If wires of a pure top net, are crossing over a partition.  "*" 2 If wires of a intra partition net are going outside the boundary of its partition.

.SH Example
.P The following command checks the violations for nets on all the partitions in the design. A report of the violations is printed in the hier.rpt file.
.P checkHierRoute
.P The output of this command on the display terminal is as follows:
