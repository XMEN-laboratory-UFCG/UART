.TH get_ccopt_effective_max_capacitance  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_effective_max_capacitance\fR \-  Returns the value of the frequency-dependent effective maximum capacitance constraint that the software will apply at a given pin in the clock tree
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_effective_max_capacitance\fR  [-help]  pin | port  [-delay_corner <corner>]  [-delay_type {early | late}]  [-source]  [-value]
.P Returns the value of the frequency-dependent effective maximum capacitance constraint that the software will apply at a given pin in the clock tree. By default, the software returns the following information:
.RS  "*" 2 The actual value of the maximum effective capacitance or constrained maximum capacitance at the specified pin  "*" 2 The source of the constraint
.RE
.P To annotate a clock period at a point in the clock tree, a new property called clock_period is provided. To aid debugging of clock period propagation, the effective or the computed clock period will be accessible for any given pin in the clock tree by querying the read only property, effective_clock_period. This property lists the set of pins that define the fastest effective_clock_period at a given pin. Details of these properties are provided below. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_ccopt_effective_max_capacitance parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man get_ccopt_effective_max_capacitance.  "\fB-delay_corner <corner>\fR" Specifies the delay corner of the specified pin for which effective maximum capacitance information is provided.  By default, if delay corner is not specified, CCOPT uses the CTS primary corner as configured by the primary_delay_corner <delay_corner_name>property of the set_ccopt_propertycommand. If this is not set, it will use the default setup analysis view as configured by the command, set_default_view -setup <newDefaultSetupView>.  "\fB-delay_type {early | late}] \fR" Specifies whether to use early or late half delays.  When early is specified, CCOPT uses only early path timing data to calculate effective maximum capacitance, for the specified clock edge. When late is specified, CCOPT uses only late path timing data to calculate effective maximum capacitance, for the specified clock edge.  By default, if neither early or late are specified, CCOPT will use late half delays to calculate effective maximum capacitance.  "\fB<pin | port>\fR" Specifies the pin for which the effective maximum capacitance value is to be returned. This is a required parameter.   "\fB-source\fR" Reports the source of the effective maximum capacitance. It is a boolean type. The reported source may be any of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 library_or_sdc: Specifies that the most constraining capacitance came from a non-frequency dependent library constraint on a library cell pin or SDC override.  This can also apply to clock roots based on the source_driver property where a clock root can be modeled as a specific type of library cell.  "*" 2 freq_dep_library: Specifies that the most constraining capacitance value came from a frequency-dependent library constraint.  As per library_or_sdc, this can also apply to clock roots via library cell modeling.  "*" 2 target_max_capacitance: Specifies that the most constraining capacitance value came from an explicit target_max_capacitance property value.  "*" 2 source_max_capacitance: Specifies that the most constraining capacitance value came from the source_max_capacitance property.  "*" 2 computed_source_max_capacitance: Specifies that the most constraining capacitance value was computed by CCOpt for a clock root based on a library cell and a transition target.
.RE   For more information about the above properties, use the following command:   get_ccopt_property -help <property_name>  "\fB-value\fR" Reports the effective maximum capacitance value of the specified pin.
