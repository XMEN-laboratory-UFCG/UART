.SH Name \fBviewBumpConnection\fR \-  Displays the connection as a flightline between a power/ground (PG) bump and a PG I/O pad, during signal bump assignment
.SH Syntax \fBviewBumpConnection\fR  [-help]   [-honor_color]  [-multiBumpsToPad]   [-multiPadsToBump]   [-remove]  [[[-net <net_list>] [-bump <bump_list>] [-io_inst <io_inst_list>] [-selected]]|[[-bumpType {all | power | signal}] [-target {pad | ring}]]]
.P Displays the connection as a flightline between a power/ground (PG) bump and a PG I/O pad, during signal bump assignment. You can remove the flightlines between the bumps and I/O pads by using viewBumpConnection -remove.
.P For both signal and power pins, viewBumpConnection, by default, displays a long pin connection with the correct location, instead of the center of the pin.
.P Note: viewBumpConnection honors the port tag information in bumps for both signal and power flightline for multiple pad and multiple bump routing. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each viewBumpConnection parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man viewBumpConnection  "\fB-bump <bump_list>\fR" Specifies bumps for which flightlines are to be displayed.   "\fB-bumpType {all | power | signal}\fR" Specifies the connecting bump type, which could be:
.RS  "*" 2 all - All the bump types
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 power - Power bump
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 signal - Signal bump
.RE   Default: all  "\fB-honor_color\fR" Colors flightlines according to the settings defined with the ciopLoadBumpColorMapFile command.  "\fB-io_inst {<io_inst_list>}\fR" Specifies IO instances or blocks for which flightlines are to be displayed. Specified IO instances should be CLASS PAD AREAIO instances. Specified blocks should have at least one pin port in CLASS BLOCK cell containing the CLASS BUMP property.   "\fB-multiBumpsToPad\fR" Displays connections from multiple bumps to one pad.  Note: If neither -multiBumpsToPad or -multiPadsToBump is specified, the viewBumpConnection command will display only one-to-one connections.  "\fB-multiPadsToBump\fR" Displays connections multiple pads to one bump.  Note: If neither -multiBumpsToPad or -multiPadsToBump is specified, the viewBumpConnection command will display only one-to-one connections.  "\fB-net <net_list>\fR" Specifies nets for which flightlines are to be displayed.   "\fB-remove\fR" Removes the bump connections.  "\fB-selected\fR" Displays flightlines for selected bumps and IO instances in bold.   "\fB-target {pad | ring}\fR" Specifies the connecting target, which could be a pad or a  ring. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command displays flightlines for bumps Bump_1 and Bump_2:   viewBumpConnection -bumps {Bump_1 Bump_2}  "*" 2 The following command displays connections from multiple bumps to one pad:  viewBumpConnection -multiBumpsToPad  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)    "*" 2 The following command displays connections from multiple bumps to one pad:  viewBumpConnection -multiPadsToBump  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
