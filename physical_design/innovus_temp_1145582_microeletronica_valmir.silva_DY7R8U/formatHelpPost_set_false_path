.SH Name \fBset_false_path\fR \-  Identifies false paths in a design, and breaks or disables specific instance timing arcs in a design
.SH Syntax  \fBset_false_path\fR  [-hold | -setup]  [-rise]   [-fall]   {[{-from | -rise_from | -fall_from} <from_list>]   [{-through | -rise_through | -fall_through} <through_list>]   [{-to | -rise_to | -fall_to} <to_list>]} 
.P Identifies false paths in a design, and breaks or disables specific instance timing arcs in a design.    Note: To break combinational loops, use the set_disable_timing command instead of the set_false_path command.
.P The set_false_path command differs from the set_disable_timing command as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 set_false_path command selectively disables the arrival time information depending on the precedence rules.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 set_false_path command does not affect constant values.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 set_disable_timing command physically snips a timing arc such that neither arrival times nor constant values propagate through it.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 set_disable_timing command is applied in all cases to valid timing arcs.
.RE
.P The set_false_path -from fpin command disables all timing paths whose source pin is an fpin. Similarly, the set_false_path -to tpin command disables all timing paths whose sink pin is a tpin. Using the set_false_path -from fpin -to tpin command disables all timing paths whose source is fpin and sink is tpin.
.P Specify a group of pins by enclosing the group with curly braces ({}) within one set_false_path command.
.P To set a false path for any path beginning at p1 or p2 and terminating at t1 or t2, group the pins as follows:
.P set_false_path -from {p1 p2} -to {t1 t2}
.P Note: This method of pin grouping reduces the number of exceptions. Having large numbers of exceptions adversely impacts the run time of the timing analysis commands. 
.SH Parameters     "\fB-fall\fR" Applies the assertion at the falling edge of the signal on the path end points.  "\fB{-from | -rise_from | -fall_from} from_list\fR" Specifies a list of timing paths start points.  The from_list argument can contain either object IDs or hierarchical names relative to the current module. The pins can be on intermediate hierarchical boundaries. The from_list argument can be a collection.  The valid start points are:
.RS  "*" 2 Input port
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Bidirectional port
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Clock pin of sequential cell   Clock pin of sequential cell is one of the following:
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Structural clock pin that is part of latch or flip-flop.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Inferred clock pin in cells like macro cells. A pin is an inferred clock pin if it is associated with one of the following:
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Reference end of setup check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Reference end of hold check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Reference end of removal check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Reference end of recovery check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Minimum period check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Minimum pulse width check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Pin associated with set_input_delay
.RE   Specify one of the following: -from:  Applies the false path constraint to all paths originating from the from_list list. If a clock is specified as the -from object, all primary inputs and registers clocked by that clock are used as start points.  By default, the -from option applies the constraint to both the rising and the falling edges. -rise_from: Applies the false path constraint at the rising edge of the signal on the from pins. -fall_from: Applies the false path constraint at the falling edge of the signal on the from pins.  "\fB-hold/-setup\fR" Sets false paths for either setup or hold analysis.  Note: If you do not specify -setup or -hold, the software sets false paths for both setup and hold analysis.  "\fB-rise\fR" Applies the assertion at the rising edge of the signal on the path endpoints.  "\fB{-through | -rise_through | -fall_through} through_list\fR" Specifies a list of timing paths through points.  The through_list argument can contain either object IDs or hierarchical names relative to the current module. The pins can be on intermediate hierarchical boundaries. The through_list argument can be a collection.  Specify one of the following: -through:  When you use this parameter without using the -from or -to options, the false path constraint is set for all paths that go through the specified pins. When you use it with both the -from and -to options, any path starting at any pin on the -from list and going through any point on the -through pin list and going to any point on the -to list is affected by the constraint.  By default, the -through option applies the constraint to both the rising and the falling edges. -rise_through: Applies the assertion at the rising edge of the signal on the through pins. -fall_through: Applies the assertion at the falling edge of the signal on the through pins.  "\fB{-to| -rise_to | -fall_to} to_list\fR" Specifies a list of timing paths end points.  The to_list argument can contain either object IDs or hierarchical names relative to the current module. The pins can be on intermediate hierarchical boundaries. The to_list argument can be a collection.  The valid end points are:
.RS  "*" 2 Output port
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Bidirectional port
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Data pin of sequential cell   Data pin of sequential cell is one of the following:
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Structural data pin that is part of latch or flip-flop.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Inferred data pin in cells like macro cells. A pin is an inferred data pin if it is associated with one of the following:
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Signal end of setup check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Signal end of hold check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Signal end of non-sequential setup check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Signal end of non-sequential hold check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Signal end of removal check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Signal end of recovery check
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Pin associated with set_external_delay
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Data pin of clock gating cell
.RE   Select from one of the following: -to:  Applies the false path constraint to all paths ending in the -to pin list. If a clock is specified as the -to object, all primary outputs and registers clocked by that clock are used as endpoint.  By default, the -to option applies the constraint to both the rising and the falling edges. -rise_to: Applies the false path constraint at the rising edge of the signal on the to pins. -fall_to: Applies the false path constraint at the falling edge of the signal on the to pins.
