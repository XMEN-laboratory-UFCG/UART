Use this command to specify the required verify_AC_limit mode settings before running any commands that perform signal electromigration. The parameters specified with the set_signal_em_analysis_mode command are then used automatically whenever signal electromigration takes place.
.P Use the get_signal_em_analysis_mode command to return the current settings for the set_signal_em_analysis_mode command.
.P Note: Use the -method parameter to specify the waveform calculation method to be used (rms, peak, or avg).
