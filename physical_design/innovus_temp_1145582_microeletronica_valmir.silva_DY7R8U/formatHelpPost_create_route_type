.P Creates a new route type and sets the routing properties for the nets. This command lets you create the standard route_type that defines a collection of routing attributes such as non-default rule (NDR), shield net, preferred layers and so on that can then be applied to either all leaf or all trunk nets for a particular clock tree. The type of route_type object created depends on the parameters you specify with this command. A standard route_type object is created if you specify the -non_default_rule, -shield_net, -top_preferred_layer or -preferred_routing_layer parameters.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each create_route_type parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man  create_route_type  "\fB-bottom_preferred_layer <layer>\fR" Specifies the preferred lowest routing layer. This attribute is a soft limit, which means, NanoRoute might use a layer below the specified layer if necessary to complete routing.  A layer name can be any real layer name, for example, from LEF or OpenAccess. Routing layer names can also be abbreviated as 1 or metal1 for the first routing layer,  2 or metal2 for the second routing layer, and so on. Note, the software will check for real layer names first. So, if metal1 matches a real layer name it might not be the first routing layer.  If not specified, the router will freely route the net starting on the first routing layer, with no preference for higher layers.  "\fB-em_ndr_dist <float>\fR" Specifies the distance related to the output pin, when em_ndr_rule is applied to the net. When routing outside this distance range, the router either uses regular wire or regular non-default routing (NDR), if the regular NDR setting is enabled in this net.   Note: When the -em_ndr_rule option is used with the command, the -em_ndr_rule option becomes mandatory.  "\fB-em_ndr_rule <rule_name>\fR" Specifies the EM NDR rule to associate with this route type. When routing within the distance specified in -em_dist from output pin, router will use this ndr rule to route.   Default: No EM NDR rule  "\fB-layer_mask_range <bottomLayerNum:topLayerNum>\fR" Specifies the layer range that the mask constrain should be applied on. For example, 3:4 means that the constrain should be applied on metal3 and metal4.  "\fB-mask mask_number\fR" Specifies the mask number in allowed range (min=0, max=3).   "\fB-min_stack_layer <layer>\fR" Specifies that the output pins of the net use stacked vias from the pin to the given <layer> and the rest of the connections start from the mentioned <layer>.  "\fB-name <string>\fR" Specifies the name of the route type object. This is required.  "\fB-non_default_rule <ndr_name>\fR" Specifies the non-default routing (NDR) rule to associate with this route_type.  Default is no NDR rule.  "\fB-one_side_spacing_range <bottomLayerNum:topLayerNum>\fR" Specifies the layer range that one side spacing constrain should be applied on. By default, NDR spacing is applied to both sides of an NDR net or wire. Use this option to specify the layer range for wires that have only one neighboring wire with minimum spacing, which means only one side needs to follow larger NDR spacing.   "\fB-prefer_multi_cut_via\fR" Specifies whether or not to use the multi-cut vias for connections at the net driver pins.   "\fB-preferred_routing_layer_effort {low | medium | high}\fR" Specifies whether the preferred routing layer effort will be low, medium or high. This parameter determines how flexible the NanoRoute router is when setting layer limits for routing specified nets. Use this parameter with the -top_preferred_routing_layer and -bottom_preferred_routing_layer parameters. Specify medium or high routing layer effort level to make NanoRoute less flexible in setting layer limits for routing specified nets. NanoRoute will obey the preferred routing layer range more strictly. Specify low to make NanoRoute more flexible in setting layer limits for routing specified nets.  Default: high  "\fB-shield_net <net_name>\fR" Specifies a special net to use as a shield for a critical or high-speed net. Typically, a shielded net is routed before routing other net. You can specify only one shield net. However, you cannot control which side is used by the special net that is routed on the same layer as the signal routing. The shield terminates near the pin.  If not specified, the net is not shielded.  "\fB-shield_side {one_side | both_side}\fR" Specifies whether to perform one sided or two sided shielding for the route type specified.  "\fB-shield_tap_instance_insertion_effort {none | standard | high}\fR" Specifies the clock route type for clock shielding of the high and low frequencies through the high and standard values respectively. The main difference between these values is related to the ground that the tie cell instance/via uses to achieve shield segments of the electrical connection.  "\fB-stack_distance <float>\fR" Specifies that the cut distance of cuts on adjacent layers in the stacked vias are defined in -min_stack_layer.   "\fB-top_preferred_layer <layer>\fR" Specifies the top-preferred layer for the route type. 
.SH Example
.P For example, use the following commands to create the standard route_types that specify the routing attributes we want to assign to particular nets:
.P create_route_type -name RT1 -non_default_rule NDR1   create_route_type -name RT2 -non_default_rule NDR2  create_route_type -name RT3 -non_default_rule NDR3 -top_preferred_layer M4 -bottom_preferred_layer M3  create_route_type -name RT4 -non_default_rule NDR4 -preferred_routing_layer_effort high -top_preferred_layer M4 -bottom_preferred_layer M3
