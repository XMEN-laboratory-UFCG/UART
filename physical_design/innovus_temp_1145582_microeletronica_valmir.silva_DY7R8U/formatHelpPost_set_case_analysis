.SH Name \fBset_case_analysis\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBset_case_analysis\fR  {0 | 1 | zero | one | rising | falling | rise | fall  | non_switching}   <list_of_ports_or_pins> 
.P Sets constant or transitional values to a list of pins or ports for use by the timing engine. The specified constants or transitional values are valid only during timing analysis and do not alter the netlist. If there is a conflict between the specified set_case_analysis value and the logical value from the netlist, the value from the set_case_analysis is used in timing analysis. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB0 | 1 | zero | one\fR" Specifies a logic value of 0 or 1, which is propagated through combinational logic to disable or enable parts of logic.  "\fBrising | falling | rise | fall  | non_switching\fR" Specifies a valid transition value to be considered by the timing engine. For example, if a rising value is specified at a certain pin or port, only the rising signal transition from the pin or port is considered for timing analysis and the opposite transition type (falling) is ignored.  "\fB<list_of_ports_or_pins>\fR" Specifies a list of ports or pins on which to apply the constant or transitional value. Specify multiple pins by enclosing them with curly braces {}and separating the pin names with white space. The <list_of_ports_or_pins> argument can be a collection. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the value of pin i4/A to 1 for use by the timing engine:   set_case_analysis 1 i4/A
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example shows that the pins P1/P2/B and P1/P3/CI are considered only for a rising transition. The falling transition on these pins is ignored:   set_case_analysis rising {P1/P2/B P1/P3/CI}
