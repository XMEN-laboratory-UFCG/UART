.P Writes the specified information to a DEF file. By default, the defOut command writes floorplan, and all placed and unplaced standard cell information to the DEF file.
.P The defOut command does not support multiple groups per region. The defOut command supports rectilinear die area.
.P By default, the defOut command does not write out any NONDEFAULTRULE or VIA defined in the LEF file. To write out a LEF via, set the defOutLefVia global environment variable to 1. To write out a nondefault rule, set the defOutLefNDR global environment variable to 1.
.P You can use the defOut command after importing a design.
.P Note: You can select the DEF version for your output file by setting the lefDefOutVersion global environment variable to the version number. For example, to set the version number to 5.6, type the following command:
.P set lefDefOutVersion 5.6 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each defOut parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man defOut.  "\fB-addHalfWireExtensionOnPin\fR" Typically, signal routing in the NETS section uses the default half-width wire extensions everywhere except for zero extensions on pins. This parameter forces the zero-extension on pins to the default half-width extension, and makes the DEF compatible for older tools that do not support DEF zero wire extensions.  Note: Using this parameter can cause DRC violations.  "\fB-allLayers\fR" By default, only wires and vias on routing layers are written to the DEF. This option will write out wires, vias, and shapes on non-routing layers to the SPECIALNETS section. This includes the LEF MASTERSLICE layers, IMPLANT layers, and ROUTING or CUT layers with sub-types MIMCAP or PASSIVATION. These shapes might have been added with add_shape, or imported from DEF or OA directly.  "\fB-bumpAsPin\fR" Writes bump cells as top-level pins in the PINS section. If a PORT in a block has a PASSIVATION layer, the tool treats it as an embedded bump. defOut -bumpAsPin outputs all the layer information for embedded bumps in the PIN section as for normal bumps. Use the -bumpAsPin parameter to generate a DEF file for use with Quantus gate-level extraction.A DEF file generated with this parameter cannot be read back into the Innovus software.  "\fB-cutRow\fR" Cuts rows against placement obstructions, block halos, or power domain fence minimum gaps.  Default: Placement blockages are written to the DEF file.  "\fB-earlyGlobalRoute\fR" Writes information about the wires generated by Early Global Router to the NETS section of the DEF file. This option implies the -routing parameter; therefore, if you specify this parameter, you do not need to specify -routing.  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the DEF output file.  If you add
.gz as a suffix, the defOut command will automatically compress the generated file.  "\fB-flatten_via_pillar\fR" Some advanced nodes that use SADP (self-aligned double patterning) use via-pillars. A via-pillar is a single via definition with two or more disjoint metal-shapes on the bottom (or top) routing layer of the via. This option will flatten the via pillar into several separate "normal" vias (e.g. a via with only a single metal shape on the top and bottom via layers). The multiple normal vias will be geometrically equivalent to the single via pillar. This can be useful for external tools that do not support a via pillar.  Note: DEF created with this option should not be read back into Innovus. It should only be used for external tools that do not support via-pillars properly.  "\fB-floorplan\fR" Writes the floorplan data to the DEF file. This information includes rows, chip size, CLASS PAD instances, CLASS BLOCK instances, and all placed standard cells.  "\fB-ioRow\fR" Generates I/O rows based on I/O pad placement, and writes the I/O row information to the DEF file.  "\fB-netlist\fR" Writes the netlist (that is, the routing connectivity information) to the DEF file. This option is typically used after the design has been placed.  Note: Use -netlist with -unplaced if the design has not been placed.  "\fB-noCoreCells\fR" Excludes core cell information from the DEF file to reduce the data size for import into APD.  "\fB-noSpecialNet\fR" Excludes special vias from the DEF file.  "\fB-noStdCells\fR" Excludes placed and unplaced standard cell information from the DEF file.  Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 If you specify this parameter with the -floorplan or -unplaced parameters, it overrides their setting.  "*" 2 Fixed and cover instances are considered as pre-placed floorplan objects. This option does not apply to them.
.RE   "\fB-noTracks\fR" Excludes output track and gcell statements to the DEF file.  "\fB-no_virtual_trim\fR" Excludes the trim metal shapes on a virtual trim metal layer.   "\fB-outputMaskLayers <listOfLayers>\fR" Specifies the output MASK data on the specified layers only.  The valid values for this option are "metal", "cut", or a list of layers separated by a space character in a form of either a single layer or a range of layers. For example, -outputMaskLayers {Metal1:Metal3 Via23}   You can also specify none as a value. When none is specified, defOut does not give any MASK data on any layer in the output.  "\fB-routing\fR" Writes the routing information to the NETS section of the DEF file. If the -routing option is not specified, both power and signal vias are not written to the DEF file.  Note: The -routing parameter implies the -netlist parameter; therefore, if you specify this parameter, you do not need to specify -netlist.  "\fB-routing_to_specialnet\fR" Writes all regular NETS routing to the SPECIALNETS section instead.  It converts all regular routing wires and vias that are normally written to the NETS section, to SPECIALNETS routing as RECT or VIA statements. This is intended to be read by analysis tools (such as RC extraction tools) that do not understand all the NETS routing properly. Some tools do not understand some newer DEF syntax, or how to interpret wrong-way routes that are wider than the default routing-rule for some advanced nodes due to WIDTH, WIDTHTABLE or SPANLENGTHTABLE rules with WRONGDIRECTION values.  Note: Specialnet routing cannot be modified by the signal router. So, it should not be read back for any flows that will require optimization or future incremental or ECO routing.  This option cannot be used with the -earlyGlobalRoute option.  "\fB-scanChain\fR" Writes scan chain information to the DEF file. This option is mandatory to ensure that START/STOP instances of scan chain are preserved during timing/power closure when reloading the DEF in another session.  "\fB-selected\fR" Writes out information for selected as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 If an instance or net is selected, writes only the DEF header and COMPONENT section for instances you have selected in the Innovus main window. If you specify the -routing parameter along with this parameter, the defOut command writes selected nets with their special routing and regular routing to the NETS section of the DEF file.  "*" 2 If a net is not selected but individual segments or vias are selected, writes only the selected vias to the DEF file. All LEF vias are excluded by default. If the defOutLefVia global variable is set to 1, defOut -selected includes selected LEF vias when writing out selected vias. If the -noSpecialNet option is specified, special vias on the selected net will not be written out.  "*" 2 If a bump is selected, writes bump pin connection to the SPECIALNETS section of the DEF file. If a net is selected but bump pins are not individually selected, bump pin connection is not written.  "*" 2 If a blockage is selected in the main window, writes blockage information to the DEF file.  "*" 2 If a group is selected, all the instances in the selected groups are treated as selected and are writtten out.
.RE   "\fB-skip_trimmetal_layers\fR" Specifies not to write trimmetal shapes in the FILLS section.   "\fB-specialRouteUserClass <user_class>\fR" Specifies the user class for special route.   "\fB-trimmetal_gap_fill\fR" Writes trimmetal gap fills to a dummy net _TRIMMETAL_FILLS_RESERVED in the SPECIALNETS section.  "\fB-unit <unit_per_micron>\fR" Defines the units for the DEF file.  "\fB-unplaced\fR" Writes information about unplaced standard cells to the DEF file.  "\fB-useEEQCellWithLibertyInfo\fR" Specifies to use the EEQ cell with the timing library information as the master cell of a leaf instance.   "\fB-usedVia\fR" Specifies that only used vias should be written to the DEF file. Unused vias are ignored. All LEF vias are also excluded by default. To include used LEF vias in the DEF file, set the defOutLefVia global variable is set to 1 before specifying defOut -usedVia.
.RS  "*" 2 If the -routing option is specified along with -usedVia, used signal vias are also written out.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If the -noSpecialNet option is specified along with -usedVia, used special vias are not written out.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If you specify both -usedVia and -selected, the -usedVia option is ignored and only selected vias are written to the DEF file. The following warning message is issued:   **WARN: (ENCDF-1039): Option -usedVia will be ignored because option -selected is specified. Only selected vias will be output. 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If neither -selected nor -usedVia is specified and the defOutLefVia variable is set to 0 (default), all DEF vias are written out.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If neither -selected nor -usedVia is specified and the defOutLefVia variable is set to 1, all DEF and LEF vias are written out.
.RE   "\fB-verilog_from_def_netlist_flow\fR" Reconciles the names in the DEF and Verilog files generated by the loadDefFile command. The  loadDefFile command generates a flat Verilog file in which all of the special characters are escaped. Use this parameter to convert the escaped names back to the original names in the DEF file.   "\fB-withShield\fR" By default, defOut does not write out the shielding routing on the power/ground net when outputting regular routing of selected nets in NETS section. When -withShield is specified, defOut writes out those shielding routing (if any) on the power/ground net which is in the SPECIALNETS section. The-withShield option must be used with the -routing and -selected options.  Note: Multiple nets can be selected. If none of the selected nets have shielding routing, the -withShield option has no effect.  "\fB-wrongway_routing_as_specialroute\fR" Writes wrong-way routing in the SPECIALNETS section.   This option duplicates any wrong-way routing segments that require extra-width into the SPECIALNETS routing section as a RECT with +SHAPE DRCFILL.  This option is intended to be used for tools (such as RC extraction tools) that do not understand how to increase the width of DEF wrong-way NETS routing properly. DEF requires wider widths for some wrong-way routes due to LEF DRC rules using the WIDTH, WIDTHTABLE, or SPANLENGTHTABLE statements along with WRONGDIRECTION values. These types of tools normally understand SPECIALNET RECT statements and can merge the SPECIALNET RECT on top of the NETS wrong-way routing segment and therefore use the correct width. The duplicate SPECIALNETS RECTs are given the +SHAPE DRCFILL keyword in order to make it easy to filter them out for tools that do not need them.  When loading back the DEF with these DRCFILL, use defIn -ignore_drcfill to ignore these duplicate wrong-way direction segments.
