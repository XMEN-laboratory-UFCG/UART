.SH Name \fBjustifyException\fR \-  Provides a debugging or justification mechanism of exceptions on ports
.SH Syntax \fBjustifyException\fR    {-pins <pinList>}  [-outfile <fileName>]  {<partitionName> | <instanceName>}  -view <viewName>   [-help] 
.P Provides a debugging or justification mechanism of exceptions on ports. This command is used to debug exception constraints and justify all exceptions on pins specified by -pins. To justify exceptions, you must set the -justify parameter of the setBudgetingMode command to true to save the justify exception data during the deriveTimingBudget process. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help                           \fR" Outputs the command usage.  "\fB<partitionName> | <instanceName>\fR" Specifies the name of the partition or instance to analyze. The <instanceName> can only be specified when the deriveTimingBudget command is used with the -inst option. In default partition mode, the <partitionName> is specified.  "\fB-outfile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the output file name that contains the justify exception data for the instances or partitions specified by <instanceName> or <partitionName>. If you do not specify an output file using the -outfile parameter, the exception data will be displayed on the screen.  "\fB-pins <pinList>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical partition pins to be analyzed. You can use * to specify all pins.   "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Prints a report for the specified view. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command justifies exception for the pins input of partition/instance partition1 and prints a report for view SETUP_VIEW1:  justifyException partition1 -pins input -view SETUP_VIEW1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command justifies exception for all pins of the partition/instance partition1 and prints a report for view HOLD_VIEW1 in the file justfyData:  justifyException partition1 -pins * -outfile justifydata -view HOLD_VIEW1
