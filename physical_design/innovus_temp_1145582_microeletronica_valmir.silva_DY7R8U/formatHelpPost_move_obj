.TH move_obj  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBmove_obj\fR \-  Moves objects (instances, modules, groups, placement blockage, routing blockage, hard macros, special routings, and I/O pins) vertically or horizontally by a specified distance
.SH Syntax \fBmove_obj\fR   [-help]   [-group]   { -point {x y} | { -direction {up down left right} { -distance value | -to {core_box die_box} }}}   { obj_list | -selected }
.P Moves objects (instances, modules, groups, placement blockage, routing blockage, hard macros, special routings, and I/O pins) vertically or horizontally by a specified distance. The objects can be moved to the die or core box boundary, as specified. You can use this command after selecting one or more objects in the design display area. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB  -direction {up down left right}\fR" Specifies the vertical and horizontal movement for the selected objects. Choose one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 up: Specifies an upward move.  "*" 2 down: Specifies a downward move.  "*" 2 left: Specifies a left move  "*" 2 right: Specifies a right move.
.RE   Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-distance <value>\fR" Specifies the distance, in micrometers, that the objects will be moved in the specified direction.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-group\fR" Moves all the specified or selected objects as a group.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each move_obj parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man move_obj  "\fB<obj_list>\fR" Specifies the list of objects to move.  Data_type: (any_object)+, optional  "\fB-point {<x y>}\fR" Specifies the lower left point that the objects will be moved to.  Data_type: point, optional  "\fB-selected\fR" Moves the selected object.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-to {core_box die_box}\fR" Moves the object to the core_box or the die_box boundary, as specified.  Data_type: enum, optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command moves each of selected objects to the left of core boundary:  move_obj -selected -direction left -to core_box  "*" 2 The following command moves the bounding box of all selected objects to the left of core boundary:  move_obj -selected -direction left -to core_box -group   "*" 2  The following command moves each of the selected objects to the left with 50um. The same as with option -group:  move_obj -selected -direction left -distance 50  "*" 2  The following command moves each of the selected objects' low left coordinates to the specified point:  move_obj -selected -point {330 410}  "*" 2  The following command moves the bounding box's low left coordinates of all selected objects to the specified point:  move_obj -selected -point {330 410} -group
