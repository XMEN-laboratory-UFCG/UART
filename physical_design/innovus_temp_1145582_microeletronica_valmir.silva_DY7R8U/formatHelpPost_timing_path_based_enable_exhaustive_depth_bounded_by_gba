.TH timing_path_based_enable_exhaustive_depth_bounded_by_gba  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_path_based_enable_exhaustive_depth_bounded_by_gba\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_path_based_enable_exhaustive_depth_bounded_by_gba\fR   {true | false}
.P Default: true
.P Enables the timing report to bound PBA results by GBA slacks of the respective leftover nworst paths, whenever exhaustive depth for an endpoint is exhausted.
.P When set to true, during exhaustive PBA, if you specify exhaustive depth as N, and an endpoint has nworst paths greater than N, then the timing report will show the worst path corresponding to worst slack out of worst PBA slack (out of first N paths) and GBA slack (for the (N+1)th path). Here, the variable N refers to exhaustive PBA depth and can be set using the timing_pba_exhaustive_path_nworst_limit global variable.
.P When set to false, during exhaustive PBA, if you specify exhaustive depth as N, and an endpoint has nworst paths greater than N, then the software will ignore the paths with depth greater than N, which may result in reporting an optimistic PBA slack for the endpoint reaching the depth.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
