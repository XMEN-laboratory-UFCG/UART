.SH Name \fBset_advanced_rail_options\fR \-  Provides the ability to include a file that provides a list of additional rail  options that should be used for rail analysis
.SH Syntax  \fBset_advanced_rail_options\fR  [-help]   [-reset] | [[-voltus_rail_include_file_begin <file_name1>]   [-voltus_rail_include_file_end <file_name2>] ]  
.P Provides the ability to include a file that provides a list of additional rail  options that should be used for rail analysis. If you do not specify values to the set_advanced_rail_options command parameters, the parameter values are set to the default value, that is, empty file name.
.P For more information on the vstorm2 commands, refer to the "Rail Analysis Options" section in the Voltus IC Power Integrity Solution Text Command Reference. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.   "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. This means that an extra include file is not required.  "\fB-voltus_rail_include_file_begin <file_name>\fR" Provides the ability to provide a file that includes additional rail  options that will be run prior to the analyze command. This can be used for those legacy rail analysis commands that do not have a Voltus equivalent.  "\fB-voltus_rail_include_file_end <file_name>\fR" Provides the ability to provide a file that includes additional rail  options that will be run after the analyze command. This can be used for those legacy rail analysis commands that do not have a Voltus equivalent.

.RS  "*" 2 The following command needs to be set to override the default precision digits:  set_advanced_rail_options -voltus_rail_include_file_begin vstorm.file  <vstorm.file>  setvar precision_digits 10  With this variable, you will get IR with 10 precision digits (10 includes all digits before and after the decimal point).
