.TH setPromotedMacroPin  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsetPromotedMacroPin\fR \-  Selects or marks signal and/or PG pin shapes to be promoted later on. You can use this command before assigning pins
.SH Syntax \fBsetPromotedMacroPin\fR   [-help]   {-reset  | -reportOnlyFile <fileName.tcl> |    {[-insts {<instName> | <instNameList>}]     [-pins {<pinName> | <pinNameList>}]     [-layers {<layerId> | <layerIdList>}]     [-override ]     [-abuttedToBoundaryOnly ]}} 
.P Selects or marks signal and/or PG pin shapes to be promoted later on. You can use this command before assigning pins.
.P Note: The setPromotedMacroPin command should be called after specifying the maximum and minimum metal layer names for promoting macro pins using the setPinAssignMode -promotedMacroMaxLayer <maxLayer> and -promotedMacroMinLayer <minLaye>r parameters, respectively.  
.SH Parameters    "\fB-abuttedToBoundaryOnly\fR" Specifies that all macro pin shapes that are abutted to the partition boundary will be selected for promotion. The -pins parameter can also be used to select abutted pins
.  Note: You can use the -maxChannelWidthAsAbutted parameter of the  setPinAssignMode command to enable thin channels in the design to be considered as abutted partitions in the pin assignment flow.  Data_type: bool, optional   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setPromotedMacroPin  parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man setPromotedMacroPin   "\fB-insts {<instName> | <instNameList>}\fR" Specifies the name of instances. You can also use wildcard (* or ?) for specifying the instance names. This parameter is optional. If -insts is not specified, all BLOCK, PAD, and AREAIO macros  are selected.   This is similar to specifying -insts *  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-layers {<layerId> | <layerIdList>}\fR" Specifies the metal layer(s) of the macro pins. This parameter is optional. If -layers is not specified, all pin layers between setPinAssignMode -promotedMinLayer and setPinAssignMode -promotedMaxLayer range are selected.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-override\fR" Specifies to override specific option(s) where previous settings of these options will be removed and be replaced by new specified value(s). For example, specifying setPromotedMacroPin -layers {} -override means no layer is promoted from now on.  Note: All setPromotedMacroPin commands are incremental with no conflict resolution, unless the -override option is used.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pins {<pinName> | <pinNameList>}\fR" Specifies the name of macro pins. You can also use wildcard (* or ?) for specifying the pin names. This parameter is optional. If -insts is not specified, all signal and P/G pins are selected. This is similar to specifying -pins *  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-reportOnlyFile <fileName.tcl> \fR" Writes out all setPromotedMacroPin settings in memory into an output TCL file.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all or specified promoted pin selections.   Data_type: bool, optional
