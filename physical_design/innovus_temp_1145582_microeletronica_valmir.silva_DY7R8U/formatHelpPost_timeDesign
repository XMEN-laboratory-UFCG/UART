.P Runs Early Global Route, extraction, and timing analysis, and generates detailed timing reports. The generated timing reports are saved in
./timingReports directory or the directory that you specify using the -outDir parameter.
.P The following timing reports are generated:

.RS  "*" 2 Density  Note: The density value reported by the timeDesign command might differ from the effective utilization value reported by the checkPlace command because timeDesign does not consider padding when calculating density, but checkPlace does consider it when calculating effective utilization.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Maximum transition time violation (<TopC> <ellName>_<DesignStage>.tran): The maximum transition value reported is the maximum value from set_max_transition command from SDC or the max_transition value specified in the library.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Maximum capacitance violation (<TopCellName>_<DesignStage>.cap): The maximum capacitance value reported is the maximum value from the set_max_capacitance command from SDC or or max_capacitance value specified in the library.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Maximum fanout violation (<TopCel> <lName>_<DesignStage>.fanout)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Glitch violations in the <outDir>/<prefix_hold>/setup directory.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Summary (<TopCel> <lName>_<DesignStage>.summary and <TopCellN> <ame>_<DesignStage>_hold.summary)  Note: The ID number displayed in the Summary report refers to long path group names.
.RE
.P The overall total negative slack (TNS) and number of violating paths of a design might not be equal to the total of the TNS and violating paths of the individual path groups. This is because the TNS and number of violating paths are based on end-point of the path and are not path based.
.P For example, the following figure has a register with two paths, one from a primary input with a slack of -0.6ns and other from another register with a slack of -0.3ns.
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P In that case the overall TNS will be -0.6ns with 1 violating path (end point-based). But the individual reg2reg TNS will be -0.3ns with 1 violating path and in2reg with a TNS of -0.6ns with 1 violating path. Therefore, the sum total of individual path group TNS is not the same as overall TNS.
.P Similarly, when you run the timeDesign command while performing multi-mode multi-corner analysis, overall TNS is not the sum of TNS of each view considered separately. The command sums the worst-case slack at each endpoint across all views. Therefore, each endpoint contributes only in overall worst-slack in the calculation of TNS. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-drvReports\fR" Generate design rule violation (DRV) reports only.  Default: Generates DRV and path reports.  "\fB-expandedViews\fR" Generates detailed view-specific timing reports when the software is in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.  For multi-mode multi-corner analysis, the software creates a separate directory for each view. For example, if your design has two analysis views, view1 and view2, the output reports are generated in the
./timingReports/view1 and
./timingReports/view2 directories.  If some of the active views have been pruned by auto view pruning then this command will restore those and give view-specific reports for all of the active views in the design.  "\fB-expandReg2Reg\fR" Specifies that the register to register path groups are divided into the following detailed path groups for generating reports:
.RS  "*" 2 Flop to flop
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Macro to flop
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Flop to macro
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Macro to macro
.RE   "\fB-hold\fR" Reports hold violations only. Before ending the timeDesign run, the software reverts back to the initial analysis mode that was set by the setAnalysisMode command (either setup or hold).  Default: Reports only setup violations  "\fB-idealClock\fR" Performs ideal clock analysis irrespective of the design stage.  Default: The software performs propagated clock analysis with the -postCTS and -postRoute parameters. The software performs ideal clock analysis with the -prePlace and -preCTS parameters.  Note: This parameter is not honored when used with -reportOnly.  "\fB-numPaths <integer>\fR" Specifies the number of paths to report in the detailed path violations.  Default: 50  "\fB-outDir <out_dir>\fR" Specifies the name of the output directory that contains all the generated reports.  Default: timingReports  "\fB-pathReports\fR" Generate path reports only.  Default: Generates DRV and path reports.  "\fB-preCTS\fR" Generates timing reports before the clock tree is built. By default, in this mode the software runs early global route, native default extraction, and timing analysis for generating timing reports. The -preCTS parameter sets setAnalysisMode to -clkSrcPath false and -clockPropagation forcedIdeal.  "\fB-prePlace\fR" Generates timing reports before the design is placed. In this mode, the software ignores the net load while building the timing graph and runs timing analysis for generating timing reports. The DRV report files are not generated in this mode, and the DRV numbers are not reported in the summary for this parameter. The -prePlace parameter sets setAnalysisMode to -clkSrcPath false and -clockPropagation forcedIdeal.  Note: The -reportOnly parameter is not honored when used with this parameter.  "\fB-proto\fR" Supports flex models.  Notes:
.RS  "*" 2 The -proto parameter supports set_proto_mode -timing_net_delay_model option.  "*" 2 The -proto parameter honors the -postCTS option.
.RE   "\fB-postCTS\fR" Generates timing reports for a design whose clock tree has been created. By default, in this mode the software runs early global route, native default extraction, and timing analysis for generating timing reports. The -postCTS parameter sets setAnalysisMode to -clkSrcPath true and -clockPropagation sdcControl.  "\fB-postRoute\fR" Generates timing reports for a design whose routing is complete. By default, in this mode the software runs native detailed extraction, and timing analysis for generating timing reports. The -postRoute parameter sets setAnalysisMode to -clkSrcPath true and -clockPropagation sdcControl.  "\fB-prefix <file_name_prefix>\fR" Specifies a prefix for the timing report file names.  Default: <DesignName_DesignStage>  "\fB-reportOnly\fR" Specifies the use of existing extraction and timing analysis data to generate timing reports. When you use this parameter, the software does not run extraction; instead it uses data that is already in memory.
.RS  "*" 2 -reportOnly is not honored when used with -prePlace.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 -idealClock is not honored when used with -reportOnly.
.RE   Note: The -preCts, -postCts, or -postRoutewith -reportOnly.  Note: If you restore a Innovus database (saved with saveDesign-rc before the timeDesign -reportOnly command is specified), a full extraction will still be performed if the database is in the pre-route stage. This is because the preRoute extraction RCDB cannot be saved into an Innovus database.  "\fB-slackReports\fR" Generate slack reports only.  Default: Generates DRV and path reports.  "\fB-timingDebugReport\fR" Generates a compressed (.gz) detailed timing report in ASCII format. This report is used for debugging timing results using the timing debug feature in Innovus.  For more information on debugging timing results, see Debugging Timing Results in Innovus User Guide.  "\fB-useTransitionFiles\fR" Reports the maximum transition violations when using external transition files specified by the readTransitionFile command.
