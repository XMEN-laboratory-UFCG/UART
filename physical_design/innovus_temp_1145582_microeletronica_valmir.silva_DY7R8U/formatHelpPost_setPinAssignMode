.SH Name \fBsetPinAssignMode\fR \-  Sets the global parameters of the partition or block pin assignment feature
.SH Syntax \fBsetPinAssignMode\fR   [-help]   [-reset]  [-advanced_node_rule_support {true | false}]  [-allow_unconnected_in_abutted_edge {true | false}]  [-allowNonNdrNetPinsOnNdrTracks {true | false}]   [-block_boundary_macro_distance<distance>]  [-force_abutment_with_fixed {true | false}]  [-max_distance_pairing <distance>]  [-maxChannelWidthAsAbutted <channelWidthInMicrons>]   [-pinEditInBatch {true | false}]  [-pinOffStripe {below | all | none}]  [-pinToStripeDistance {<listOfLayerDistanceValuePair>}]  [-pinToViaDistanceNonPrefDirection {<listOfLayerDistanceValuePair>}]  [-pinToViaDistancePrefDirection {<listOfLayerDistanceValuePair>}]  [-promotedMacroMaxLayer <layerName>]   [-promotedMacroMinLayer <layerName>]  [-restrict_boundary_macro_distance <distance> ]  [-strict_abutment {true | false}]
.P Sets the global parameters of the partition or block pin assignment feature. Parameters specified with the setPinAssignMode command are then used whenever you run the pin related commands. Use the getPinAssignMode command to return the current settings for the setPinAssignMode command. You can use this command before assigning pins.
.P Note: You can use the -topRoutingLayer and -bottomRoutingLayer parameters of the  setDesignMode to specify the maximum and minimum layers, respectively, for routing, partition, or block pin assignment.
.P Note: To control the pin assignment layers, you can use the setPinConstraint command. The setPinConstraint command sets the constraints for partition pins or I/O pins. The constraints can be applied on three different levels:  global pin constraints, cell specific pin constraints, and pin specific constraints. If no pin specific constraints exist, then the cell level constraints are applied. If cell specific pin constraints are not defined, then global constraints are applied. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-advanced_node_rule_support {true | false}\fR" A true value specifies that 20nm (and below) as well as DPT LEF rules will be respected (if present in LEF technology file) for determining and resolving any DRC violations, during all pin assignment related commands.  Default: true  Data_type: bool  "\fB-allow_unconnected_in_abutted_edge {true | false}\fR" A true value specifies that unconnected partition pins can be placed in abutted edges.  Default: true  Data_type: bool  "\fB-allowNonNdrNetPinsOnNdrTracks {true | false} \fR" A true value allows general pins to be placed on NDR tracks (if available). Alternatively, if the value is set to false, the NDR-track rule is followed strictly and the net pins are placed on matching NDR tracks only.   Default: true  Data_type: bool  "\fB-block_boundary_macro_distance< distance>\fR" Blocks automatic pin assignment from putting pins, on the part of the partition boundary facing the block, where the channel width between the partition boundary and the block is less than the value specified. For channel width below the specified value, it blocks pins on the boundary facing this channel.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 100  Default: 3  Data_type: float  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setPinAssignMode parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setPinAssignMode   "\fB-force_abutment_with_fixed {true|false}\fR" Specifies that for the connected pin of fixed abutted pins, ignore soft constraints check.  Some partitions in abutted design have preassigned pins with 1-track spacing and marked as fixed. As the design is abutted, there is no other legal location for such pins. Also, the automatic pin assignment has default spacing of two tracks. As a result, all pins connecting to these reference pins with one spacing are not assigned and lot of pins are left unassigned. When the -force_abutment_with_fixed is enabled,  track spacing violations are ignored. As a result, assigns the corresponding pins opposite to the prefixed pins while maintaining abutment of pins.  Default: true  Data_type: bool  "\fB-max_distance_pairing <distance>\fR" Ignores moving corresponding connected pins of 2-pin-connection nets where distance (in microns) between the pins is equal or greater than distance specified. You can avoid moving the corresponding pin for any channel width (routing bends are acceptable in channels) by using the distance value for the -max_distance_paring parameter as 0.   Minimum: 0  Maximum: 10000  Default: 50  Data_type: float  "\fB-maxChannelWidthAsAbutted <channelWidthInMicrons> \fR" Specifies that all channels with width less than or equal to the specified width will be considered as abutted and abutment rules will be applied on them.  Notes: 
.RS  "*" 2 The assignPtnPin, assignIoPins, and the legalizePin commands do not place non-neighbor pins in the thin channels considered abutted.  "*" 2 The checkPinAssignment command reports an abutment violation in case a non-neighboring pin is placed in the thin channel (abutted). The -preCheck option of the checkPinAssignment command that checks for the feasibility of pin assignment, also treats these thin channels as abutted.
.RE   Minimum: 0  Maximum: 400  Default: 3   Data_type: float  "\fB-pinEditInBatch {true | false}\fR" Enables pin-editing in batch mode.   Note: Once the interactive pin assignment is complete, it is important to set the mode to false. This can be done using the setPinAssignMode -pinEditInBatch false command.  Default: false   Data_type: bool  "\fB-pinOffStripe {below | all | none}\fR" Prevents the generation of pins on metal layers with respect to the power and ground stripe.
.RS  "*" 2 below: Prevents the generation of pins on metal layers below the power and ground stripes.   "*" 2 all: Prevents the generation of pins on all metal layers, above and below the power and ground stripes.  "*" 2 none: Allows the generation of overlapping pins on all metal layers.
.RE   Default: none   Data_type: enums={below all none}  "\fB-pinToStripeDistance {<listOfLayerDistanceValuePair>}\fR" Specifies the distance (in microns) from pin to stripe. It is layer specific.  Default: ""  Data_type: string  "\fB-pinToViaDistanceNonPrefDirection {<listOfLayerDistanceValuePair>}\fR" Specifies the distance (in microns) from pin to via-stack. It is layer specific.  Default: ""  Data_type: string  "\fB-pinToViaDistancePrefDirection {<listOfLayerDistanceValuePair>}\fR" Specifies the distance (in microns) from pin to via-stack from the partition fence boundary. It is layer specific.  Default: ""  Data_type: string  "\fB-promotedMacroMaxLayer <layerName>\fR" Specifies the maximum metal layer name for promoting macro pins.  Default: 31  Data_type: string   "\fB-promotedMacroMinLayer <layerName>\fR" Specifies the minimum metal layer name for promoting macro pins.  Default: 31  Data_type: string  "\fB-reset\fR" Restores all parameters modified using setPinAssignMode to their default settings. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setPinAssignMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-restrict_boundary_macro_distance <distance>\fR" Blocks automatic pin assignment, from putting pins on the part of the partition boundary facing the block, in the places where the channel width between the partition boundary and the block is less than the specified value. For the channel width below the specified value, allowed layers and the channel length/width will be considered to allow a suitable number of pins on the boundary facing this channel.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 100  Default: 30  Data_type: float  "\fB-strict_abutment {true | false}\fR" Controls abutted check for non-neighbour 2-pin and multi-partition pins.  Default: true   Data_type: bool
