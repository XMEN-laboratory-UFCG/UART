.SH Name \fBdeleteBumpConnectTargetConstraint\fR \-  Deletes existing properties on specified, selected, or all bumps
.SH Syntax \fBdeleteBumpConnectTargetConstraint\fR  [-help]   {-bump <list_of_bumps> | -selected | -all }   [-instName <instance_name> [-pinName <pin_name> [-portNum <value>]]] 
.P Deletes existing properties on specified, selected, or all bumps. If a bump has multiple values for the property, use -instName, -pinName and -portNum to filter out the matched property value for deletion. If only -instName is specified, then all property values for the pad are deleted. If only -instName and -pinName are specified, then all property values for the pin are deleted. If the specified property value cannot be found for a bump, the tool prints an error message for the bump only and continues to process other bumps. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each deleteBumpConnectTargetConstraint parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man deleteBumpConnectTargetConstraint  "\fB-bump <list_of_bumps> | -selected | -all\fR" Deletes bump connect target constraint on specified, selected, or all bumps. The -bump option can accept wild cards and  -selected can have multiple bumps selected.   "\fB-instName <instance_name>\fR" Deletes the bump connect target constraint related to the specified instance.  "\fB-pinName <pin_name>\fR" Deletes the bump connect target constraint related to the specified pin.  Note: This option can be used only if you specify -instName.  "\fB-portNum <value>\fR" Deletes the bump connect target constraint related to the specified port number.  Note: This option can be used only if you specify -instName and -pinName.
