.SH Name \fBgroup_path\fR \-  Groups paths in a design, and identifies them with a path group name
.SH Syntax \fBgroup_path\fR  [-help]  [-comment <string>]   -name <path_group_name>  [[-from <from_list>]   [-to <to_list>]    [-through <through_list>]] 
.P Groups paths in a design, and identifies them with a path group name. You can use the path group names for reporting.
.P You cannot use group_path statements in the SDC file when the software is in MMMC mode. In this case a warning is issued. However, the software supports the group_path command in MMMC mode as a command outside of the SDC file. The path groups are considered to be global in nature and apply to all the views, and are not supported on MMMC mode-specific basis. The path groups are persistent through a saveDesign to restoreDesign sequence. They are saved in the <saveDir>/mmmc/pathgroup.sdc file of a MMMC save directory.
.P Note that if a path can be included in multiple path groups, it will only be included in the path group with the most specific definition (-from
... -through
... -to
... is more specific than -from
... -to
... is more specific than -from
...). 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-comment <string>\fR" Allows you to insert comments. The comments are read but are ignored with a one-time warning message. They are not used during timing analysis reporting nor are they written out during saving of constraints.  "\fB-from <from_list>\fR" Specifies a list of pins, instances, or clocks that are the start of the paths. When you specify a clock object, all paths that are triggered by the clock are included in the path group.  "\fB-name <path_group_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the path group. If the path_group_name already exists, the specified paths are added to the existing path group.  "\fB-through <through_list>\fR" Specifies the pins or instances where the paths go through. When you specify multiple through list, the paths that go through the objects in the specified order are added to the path group.  "\fB-to <to_list>\fR" Specifies a list of pins, instances, or clocks where the path ends. You must specify valid endpoints in the <to_list> or else the software ignores the constraint. When you specify a clock object, all paths that are checked by the clock are included in the path group. If you specify an instance name in the <to_list>, all the data input pins of the instance are added to the path group. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 The following example groups paths that start from specific pins and end at the D pin of any instances whose name start with the string ff. The example also reports the specified path groups:   group_path -name path1 -from {ff1/CLK ff2/CLK} -to {ff*/D}   report_timing -path_group path1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2  The following command groups paths that go through specific points.   group_path -name path2 -through an1/Z -through an2/Z -through an3/Z
