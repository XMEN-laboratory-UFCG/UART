.SH Name \fBsetUsefulSkewMode\fR \-  Sets global parameters for the skewClock command
.SH Syntax \fBsetUsefulSkewMode\fR  [-help]  [-opt_skew_apply_delay_limits_to_full_flow {true|false}]  [-opt_skew_delay_pre_cts {true|false}]  [-opt_skew_macro_only {true | false}]  [-opt_skew_max_allowed_delay <delay>]  [-opt_skew_min_allowed_delay <delay>]  [-opt_skew_no_boundary {true | false}]  [-reset] 
.P Sets global parameters for the skewClock command.
.P Use the getUsefulSkewMode to return the current settings for the setUsefulSkewMode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setUsefulSkewMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setUsefulSkewMode.  "\fB-opt_skew_apply_delay_limits_to_full_flow {true|false}\fR" When set to true, specifies that the useful skew limit is to be applied to the whole flow. With this setting, the Early Clock Flow is modified so that pre-existing tool-generated useful skews count towards the limit imposed by the -opt_skew_max_allowed_delay parameter. The tool-generated useful skew comprises any pin insertion delay (PID) of category useful_skew or global_skew. PIDs of other categories are not considered.  By default, this parameter is set to false, which means the pre-existing skews are not considered while calculating the limit imposed by using the -opt_skew_max_allowed_delay parameter.  Default: false  "\fB-opt_skew_delay_pre_cts {true |false}\fR" Specifies that the useful skew feature is allowed to delay sequential elements in preCTS stage, in addition to just advancing them. This enables a more aggressive algorithm which is recommended when timing closure is gated by optimal skewing.  Default:true  "\fB-opt_skew_macro_only {true | false}\fR" Allows you to limit skewing only for macro cells. When enabled, regular sequential elements (such as flip-flops) will not be skewed.  Default: false  "\fB-opt_skew_max_allowed_delay <delay>\fR" Limits the amount of slack (in nanoseconds) that the software can borrow from neighboring flip-flops when performing useful skew operations. The Innovus delay calculation and RC extraction methods might differ from those of sign-off tools, so other setup violations might occur if the software borrows too much slack. By having control over slack borrowing, you can prevent these setup violations. Limiting borrowed skew also limits the clock tree skew to avoid large hold violations.  Value Range: min=0 max=1000  Default: 1ns  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This parameter is not honored in the postCTS mode of skewClock.  "*" 2 In the non-early clock flow, when skewClock is triggered inside optDesign, and this parameter is set to its default value, the default value of this parameter will change from 1 to become a certain percentage of clock cycle. This is determined by the software on the basis of internal calculations.
.RE   "\fB-opt_skew_min_allowed_delay <delay>\fR" Allows the tool to skip any skewing that would be smaller than the minimum delay that is set. The purpose is to avoid creating very small delay macro models which would not be correctly honored during CTS stage but also to reduce the amount of macro models generated.  Value Range: min=0 max=1000  Default: 0  Note:  
.RS  "*" 2 This is supported in both standalone skewClock command and for -usefulSkew called within optDesign.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Enable the -usefulSkew parameter in optDesign by setting setOptMode -opt_skew true
.RE   "\fB-opt_skew_no_boundary {true |false}\fR" Excludes or includes boundary sequential cells in addition to ordinary sequential elements in useful skew calculations.  Default: false  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify only -reset, the software resets all setUsefulSkewMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command resets the -delayPreCts parameter to its default value:   setUsefulSkewMode -reset -opt_skew_delay_pre_cts
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command resets all setUsefulSkewMode parameters to their default values:   setUsefulSkewMode -reset
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command forces the tool to skew at minimum by 30ps any elements that can be skewed to improve the setup timing slack:   setUsefulSkewMode -opt_skew_min_allowed_delay 0.03  skewClock /optDesign -preCts
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command allows the user to limit skewing only for macro cells:   setUsefulSkewMode -opt_skew_macro_only true  skewClock or optDesign -preCts/-postCts
