.SH Name \fBsaveDrc\fR \-  Saves DRC violation markers in the specified file
.SH Syntax \fBsaveDrc\fR  [-help]   <fileName>[-force]  [-selected] 
.P Saves DRC violation markers in the specified file. The saveDrc command is useful for situations where you want to save DRC violation markers without having to save the entire design.
.P For example, if during ECO you find that only 25 of the 500 reported violations are actual violations that need to be corrected immediately, you can:
.RS  "*" 2 Delete the other 475 violations.  "*" 2 Save the 25 violations in a marker file using the saveDrc command.  "*" 2 Clear the violations from the design window.  "*" 2 Load the marker file containing the saved violation markers using the loadDrc command.
.RE
.P Use the saveDrc command after markers have been flagged by any of the following commands:
.RS  "*" 2 verify_drc
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 verifyMetalDensity
.RE
.P You can also use this command to save Calibre violation markers after a Calibre file has been loaded using the loadViolationReport command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each saveDrc parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man saveDrc  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Saves the DRC violation markers in a file with the specified name.  "\fB-force\fR" Creates drc file with a 0 drc count.  Note: When there is no drc in the design, drc file is not generated (Default).  "\fB-selected\fR" Saves only the selected DRC violation markers.
