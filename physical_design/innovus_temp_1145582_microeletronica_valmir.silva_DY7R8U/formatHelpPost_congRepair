.SH Name \fBcongRepair\fR \-  Relieves the congestion of the design
.SH Syntax \fBcongRepair\fR   -help  -area llx lly urx ury 
.P Relieves the congestion of the design. This command performs incremental placement based on early global route congestion results and improves the congestion hot spots by spreading out the cells. It is mostly used after place_design, but sometimes it can be used after pre CTS optimization as well. Since this command tends to move many cells around, it should not be run after post CTS optimization. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each congRepair
.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man congRepair   "\fB-area <llx lly urx ury> \fR" Specifies the area in which congRepair will run.
.RS  "*" 2 llx: Specifies the area's lower left x coordinate.  "*" 2 lly: Specifies the area's lower left y coordinate.  "*" 2 urx: Specifies the area's upper right x coordinate.  "*" 2 ury: Specifies the area's upper right y coordinate.
.RE   Note: If you do not specify this option, congRepair will run on the complete design.
