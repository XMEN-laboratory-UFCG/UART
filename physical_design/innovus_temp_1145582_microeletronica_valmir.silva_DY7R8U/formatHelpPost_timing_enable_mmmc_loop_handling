.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_mmmc_loop_handling\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_enable_mmmc_loop_handling\fR  {true | false}   Default: true 
.P When set to true, loop breaking is handled independently per analysis view, according to the following rules in order of precedence:
.RS  "*" 2 If an analysis view does not contain a combinational loop, it does not inherit any loop breaking done for other views.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If a loop exists, and the user has supplied specific case analysis and set_disable_timing constraints to break the loop at a certain place, the specified loop break is honored. 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If a loop is still detected, the software automatically selects a point to break the loop, and applies the loop break consistently to any views where the loop exists.
.RE
.P When set to false, if a combinational loop is detected in any analysis view, the timing system breaks the loop by disabling an arc along the looping path. These combinational loop breaks are reflected in all analysis views, even if those views by themselves do not contain these looping paths.   Note: Cadence strongly recommends that all combinational loops detected by the software be evaluated, to ensure that the loop is broken at the most ideal location. Automatic loop breaking decisions are made based on how the design is traversed. Small changes in the design can influence where loop breaking decisions are made.   To reduce risk and the need to re-evaluate loop-breaking decisions, it is highly recommended that once combinational loop breaks have been evaluated, the user add constraints to ensure that the loop is always broken in that location.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
