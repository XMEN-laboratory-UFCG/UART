.SH Name \fBeditCopy\fR \-  Copies selected or specified objects to the specified location
.SH Syntax \fBeditCopy\fR  [-help]  [-objects <string>]   [-orientation {R0 R90 R180 R270 MX MX90 MY MY90}]  [-net <net_name> | -net_group <string> | -keep_net_name]  [-rotate_point {x y} | -times <integer>]  [-rotate_point {x y} | [<dx> <dy> ]]
.P Copies selected or specified objects to the specified location. In the current release, the command supports the copying of bus guides, regular wires and vias, special wires and vias, as well as patch wires. When setEditMode -snap_objects_to_track regular (or special or patch) is set before using editCopy, copied wires of that type are snapped to track. 
.P Note: Use the copyObject and pasteObject commands to copy placement and routing blockages. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editCopy parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man editCopy   "\fB<dx>\fR" Specifies the dx distance to move the object copy in microns.  "\fB<dy>\fR" Specifies the dy distance to move the object copy in microns.   "\fB-keep_net_name\fR" Specifies that the net name from the original object should be retained after copying.  "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the net to which the copied object should be assigned. If neither -net nor -keep_net_name is specified and:
.RS  "*" 2 The copied wire connects to a single wire, the tool assigns the single wire's net to the copied wire.  "*" 2 The copied wire connects to multiple wires on the same net, the tool assigns the net to the copied wire.  "*" 2 The copied wire connects to multiple wires on different nets, the tool assigns _NULL to the copied wire and displays the following message:  **WARN: (IMPSPR-304): One target route connects to more than one routes on different nets, net for the target route might not be correctly assigned. Undo and try again to pick a proper location.
.RE   "\fB-net_group <string>\fR" Assigns the specified net group name to the new copy of the bus guide. You can specify only one net group name with the -net_group parameter. If the net group name you specify does not exist, the tool does not copy the bus guide and issues an error message.  If you copy a bus guide without the -net_group parameter, the new bus guide retains the net group name of the original bus guide.   Note that the -net_group parameter cannot be used for wires or vias. If you use it for copying a wire or via, the tool ignores the setting but continues the copy operation with a warning.  Similarly, the -net and -keep_net_name parameters do not work for bus guides. If you copy a bus guide with -net or -keep_net_name, the tool ignores the settings, issues a warning, and copies the bus guide with the original net group name.  "\fB-objects <string>\fR" Specifies the object pointers to be copied.  "\fB-orientation {R0 R90 R180 R270 MX MX90 MY MY90}\fR" Specifies the orientation of object copy after pasting. Use this parameter to rotate the selected wire or via during copy/paste. For values R0, R90, R180, and R270, the wire or via is rotated by specified degrees around the lower left point. For values MX, MX90, MY, and MY90, the bounding box is mirrored.  "\fB-rotate_point {x y}\fR" Rotates the copied wire(s) around the specified point {<x y>}, when specified along with the -orientation parameter. If the -rotate_point parameter is not specified, the copied wires are rotated by default around the lower-left corner of the bounding box of the original wires.  If you specify the -rotate_point parameter without the -orientation parameter, the tool copies the object at the same location. This is the same as specifying the -orientation {R0} option.   Note: The -rotate_point parameter cannot be used with the -times parameter.  "\fB-times <integer>\fR" Specifies the number of times the object is to be copied. For example, if you specify 3, the selected wire is copied thrice. The distance between different copies of the wire is equal to the distance between the original wire and the first copy. If you move the first copy, the other copies are moved by the same distance:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note: If DRC checking is turned on with setEditMode -drc_on true, all copied wires obey the DRC rules. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command copies the specified wire 5 microns up and to the right of the original and rotates the wire by 90 degrees around the lower left corner:  editCopy 5 5 -orientation R90 -objects <wire_pointer>  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command copies the selected wires 3 times and the distance between each copy set is as specified:  editCopy 5.0 10.0 -times 3 -keep_net_name  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following commands rotate the new copy of the selected wire by 90, 180, and 270 degrees, respectively, around the specified rotation point, x y:  editCopy -orientation R90 -rotate_point x y  editCopy -orientation R180 -rotate_point x y  editCopy -orientation R270 -rotate_point x y  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following commands rotate the new copy of the selected group of wires by 90, 180, and 270 degrees, respectively, around the specified rotation point, x y:  editCopy -orientation R90 -rotate_point x y  editCopy -orientation R180 -rotate_point x y  editCopy -orientation R270 -rotate_point x y  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command copies the selected bus guide 10 microns to the right of the original:  editCopy 10 0  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command copies the selected bus guide 10 microns to the right of the original and assigns the net group B to the copy:  editCopy 10 0 -net_group B  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
