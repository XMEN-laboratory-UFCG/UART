.TH setIsolatedCutRule  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsetIsolatedCutRule\fR \-  Specifies spacing rules for isolated cut layers
.SH Syntax \fBsetIsolatedCutRule\fR  [-help]   -spacing <spacing1>  [-cornerSpacing <spacing2>]   [-layer {<cutLayer_list>}]  
.P Specifies spacing rules for isolated cut layers. Use this command before running the verifyIsolatedCut command to set the spacing rules against which verifyIsolatedCut should check isolated cuts. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setIsolatedCutRule parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man setIsolatedCutRule  "\fB-cornerSpacing <spacing2>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance <spacing2> for the corner check. If all corners of the cut being validated have another cut within <spacing2> in the quadrant, the cut being checked is not a violation.  Note: -connerSpacing is ignored if <spacing2> is smaller than -spacing <spacing1>.  "\fB-layer {<cutLayer_list>}\fR" Sets the spacing rule for specified cut layers. If this parameter is not specified, the rule is applied for all cut layers.  "\fB-spacing <spacing1>\fR" Specifies the maximum distance between the cut being validated to its nearest cut. If the actual distance is less than or equal to <spacing1>, verifyIsolatedCut does not report a violation. If the actual distance between the cut being validated and its nearest cut is greater than <spacing1>, verifyIsolatedCut  reports a violation. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command specifies that the maximum distance between the cut being validated and the nearest cut should be 0.5:   setIsolatedCutRule -spacing 0.5
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following set of command specifies that the maximum distance between the cut being validated and the nearest cut should be 0.1. In addition, the maximum distance for the corner check should be 0.5. All cuts that violate these spacing rules are marked:   setIsolatedCutRule -spacing 0.1 -cornerSpacing 0.5   verifyIsolatedCut
