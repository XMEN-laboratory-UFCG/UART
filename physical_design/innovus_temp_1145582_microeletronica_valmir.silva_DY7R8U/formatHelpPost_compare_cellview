.SH Name \fBcompare_cellview\fR \-  Compares the boundary and terminal (name, direction, layer, location, size, and port) of the specified cell views
.SH Syntax \fBcompare_cellview\fR  [-help]   [-ignore {pin_purpose}]   [-log <report_file_name>]   { {{-source {<from_lib from_cell from_view>} -compare {<to_lib to_cell to_view>}} | {-lib <lib> -cell <cell> -view {<sourceView compareView>}}} }
.P Compares the boundary and terminal (name, direction, layer, location, size, and port) of the specified cell views. In addition, if both cell views are identified as abstract, the command also compares cell type, symmetry, and obstructions.
.P Use this command to compare two OpenAccess databases. For instance, you can use this command to compare the lib/cell/view specified using -source to the lib/cell/view specified with -compare. Typical uses are comparing two versions of a layout cell view or comparing an abstract cell view to a layout cell view.
.P This command can be used without design import. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each compare_cellview parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man compare_cellview.  "\fB-cell <cell>\fR" Specifies the cell for comparing two views.   "\fB-compare {<to_lib to_cell to_view>}\fR" Specifies the library/cell/view that is to be compared.   "\fB-ignore {pin_purpose}\fR" Specifies the list of attributes to be excluded from the cell comparison. As of now, the only attribute that can be ignored is the purpose, which is specified using the value pin_purpose with -ignore.  "\fB-lib <lib>\fR" Specifies the library for comparing two views.   "\fB-log <report_file_name>\fR" Specifies the report file in which all the comparison detail is to be written.   "\fB-source {<from_lib from_cell from_view>}\fR" Specifies the source library, cell, and view.   "\fB-view {<sourceView compareView>}\fR" Specifies different views of the same library/cell. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command compares two views of the same cell that are present in the same library zambezi45 and writes the report to the test1a file:   compare_cellview -source {zambezi45 pll_vcodiv layout} -compare {zambezi45 pll_vcodiv abstract} -log test1a  A sample output is displayed below:  ###################################################  # #  # Compare_cellview comparison #  # #  ###################################################  Source Design : 'zambezi45/pll_vcodiv/layout' is identified as layout design  Compare Design : 'zambezi45/pll_vcodiv/abstract' is identified as abstract design  Source Design seems to have been modified after the Compare Design has been created  Compare Celltype  Source Design has celltype 'none' & Compare Design has Celltype 'block'  Compare Cell Boundary  Source Design has different PRBoundary than Compare Design  Compare Terminals  Source Design has Pin 'en' which has Port with shape (36.215 0 36.355 0.14) on layer 'Metal5' and purpose 'pin' is not present in Compare Design    Compare Design has Pin 'en' which has a Port with shape (36.215 0 36.36 0.14) on layer 'Metal5' and purpose 'net' is not present in Source Design  
...  Antenna Information  Antenna Information is defined for Pin 'en' in Compare but not defined in Source Design    Antenna Information is defined for Pin 'vcocalen' in Compare but not defined in Source Design   
...  Source Design is not equivalent to Compare Design   "*" 2  The following command compares the views fplan1 and fplan2 of the library DesignLib and the cell myAlu:  compare_cellview -lib DesignLib -cell myAlu -view {fplan1 fplan2}
