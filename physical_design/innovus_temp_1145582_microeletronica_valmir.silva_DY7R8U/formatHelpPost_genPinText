.SH Name \fBgenPinText\fR \-  Generates a file containing pin text information for nets and cells
.SH Syntax \fBgenPinText\fR  [-format {assura dracula pvs}]  [-help]  [-layerMap <fileName>]   [-offset {<x> <y>}]   {[-nets {<nets...>}]   [-cells {<cells>...}]}   <pin_text_file> 
.P Generates a file containing pin text information for nets and cells. You can read this file into Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) tools such as Dracula and Assura for debugging problem areas.
.P You can use the genPinText command after you have finished placing, routing, and verifying your design in Innovus.
.P Note: Pin label is attached to physical pin shapes. If physical pin shapes do not exist, the pin text is labeled on any one instance pin shape. If both physical pin and instance pin shapes do not exist on the net, no pin text is generated in the output. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each genPinText parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man genPinText.  "\fB-cells {<cells>
...}\fR" Specifies the list of leaf-level cells or top cell for which the pin text information is to be generated. The list of cells can be specified within braces or quotes. Additionally, pin text information can be output for all the cells using "*". The x y values generated for the pin text are coordinates in user units local to the cell. You should not specify this parameter with the   -nets parameter if you want to use this file with Dracula; however, you can specify both parameters if you use Assura or a third-party LVS tool.  "\fB-format {assura dracula pvs}\fR" Specifies the output format.   "\fB-layerMap <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the file that contains the mapping between LEF layers and layers defined in the LVS tool. The layer map file has the following format:  LEF_LAYER_NAME VERIF_LAYER_NAME  If you do not specify this parameter, Innovus assumes that the LEF layer names and LVS layer names are identical.  "\fB-nets {<nets>
...}\fR" Lists the name of the nets for which you want to generate pin text. You cannot use a wildcard (*) to specify all nets. You must use braces to enclose the list of nets. You should not specify this parameter with the -cells parameter if you want to use this file with Dracula; however, you can specify both parameters if you use Assura or a third-party LVS tool.  "\fB-offset {<x> <y>}\fR" Specifies, in microns, the location of the design in the GDSII output file. When the GDSII output file is saved, the design shifts to the specified location.   "\fB<pin_text_file>\fR" Specifies the pin text output file name. For information about the output file format see the Examples section below.
.P Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The genPinText command creates a file containing one line of data for each cell or net you specify. The line has the following format:   name X=<x> Y=<y> ATTACH=<verif_layer_name cell_name>  The elements are
.RE   "\fB<name>\fR" Specifies the net name (from the -nets parameter) or pin name (from the -cell parameter).  "\fBX=<x> Y=<y>\fR" Specifies the x and y coordinates for the pin text.  "\fBATTACH=<verif_layer_name>\fR" Specifies the layer name used in the LVS tool.  "\fB<cell_name>\fR" Specifies the cell name. The default is the top cell name.
.P 
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a file, pins.txt, containing pin text information for clk1 and VDD:   getPinText -nets {clk1 VDD} pins.txt  The output file would resemble the following:  clk1 X=0.0 Y=10.0 ATTACH=metal1 top_cell  VDD X=-10.0 Y=-10.0 ATTACH=metal2 top_cell  VDD X=20.0 Y=20.0 ATTACH=metal3 top_cell
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a file, hedtext.txt, for cells block1 and block2:   genPinText -cells {block1 block2} hedtext.txt  The output file would resemble the following:  pin1b1 X=0.0 Y=0.0 ATTACH=metal1 block1  pin2b1 X=1.0 Y=1.0 ATTACH=metal2 block1  and so on, until all pins for block1 are listed. Coordinates are local to block1.  pin1b2 X=0.0 Y=0.0 ATTACH=metal2 block2  pin2b2 X=1.0 Y=1.0 ATTACH=metal2 block2  and so on, for all pins for block2.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a file, pins.txt, containing pin text information for clk1,clk2, and rst pins of the top cell myTopCell:   getPinText -nets {clk1 clk2 rst} -cells {myTopCell} pins.txt  The output file would resemble the following:  clk1 X=204.27 Y=157.64 ATTACH=METAL2 myTopCell  clk2 X=152.13 Y=0.28 ATTACH=METAL2 myTopCell  rst X=0.33 Y=167.72 ATTACH=METAL2 myTopCell
