.SH Syntax \fBreportIgnoredNets\fR  [-help]   -outfile <fileName> 
.P Generates a report that lists the nets that are ignored by timing optimization (optDesign) or that might impact timing closure. You can use this command after loading a design with timing constraints.
.P  The report lists the following types of nets:
.RS  "*" 2 Nets that are ignored by timing optimization  "*" 2 Nets that might impact timing closure but are not ignored
.RE
