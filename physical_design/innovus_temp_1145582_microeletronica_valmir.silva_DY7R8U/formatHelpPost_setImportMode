.SH Name \fBsetImportMode\fR \-  Controls aspects of how the software reads in the Verilog netlist and other design files
.SH Syntax \fBsetImportMode\fR  [-help]  [-reset]   [-discardFloatingVNets {true|false}]  [-keepEmptyModule {true| false}]  [-minDBUPerMicron <DBUPerMicron>]  [-syncRelativePath {true | false}]  [-timerMode {true|false}] 
.P Controls aspects of how the software reads in the Verilog netlist and other design files.
.P Use the getImportMode command to return the current settings for the setImportMode command.
.P You can use the setImportMode command before importing a design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each setImportMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setImportMode.  "\fB-discardFloatingVNets {true|false}\fR" If true, an hnet (Verilog wire statement) that has nothing connected to it, is deleted from the netlist. The default value is false in Innovus to allow for netlist repair, but true in Tempus to delete non-timed nets and reduce memory.  Default: false  "\fB-keepEmptyModule {true | false}\fR" Keeps empty modules.  If set to false, the software converts the empty modules into special leaf cells that do not have a physical library associated with them.  If the module is a hard macro, using a value of true or false produces the identical behavior: the software keeps the module.  Default: true  Note:  Empty modules can be removed later from the design by using the deleteEmptyModule command.  "\fB-minDBUPerMicron <DBUPerMicron>\fR" Sets the minimum database units per micron allowed when LEF files initialize the database units.  You can specify a value for the minimum database units per micron allowed when LEF files initialize the database units. This option is intended for users with LEF files that have database units that are not fine enough for NanoRoute to run properly - when NanoRoute requires the LEF database units to be finer than the manufacturing grid. If you do not want to modify your LEF file, you can use this option to override the LEF database units value.  The default value is 0, which means that the software uses the LEF file units. The software uses the units set in the LEF file, if the LEF units are greater than the minimum database units you specify. Conversely, if the units you specify are greater than the LEF units, the software uses the units you specify. The value you set is saved so the next time you open the design it will have the same database units.  Default: 0  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setImportMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-syncRelativePath {true | false}\fR" Synchronizes all relative paths in the top.globals file to the current working directory. Use this parameter if you want to restore the design without first changing your current working directory to the directory saved in the previous design session.  Default: false (You must change your working directory to the directory saved in the previous design session before you restore the design.)  "\fB-timerMode {true|false}\fR" When set to true, the tool loads only the Verilog and MMMC file (including timing constraint, timing lib, and RC extraction) during restoreDesign.
