.SH Name \fBverify_antenna\fR \-  Verifies the process antenna effect (PAE) in multi-thread mode with geometry-based check through the advanced NanoRoute antenna checker feature
.SH Syntax \fBverify_antenna\fR  [-help]   [-detailed]  [-error <integer>]  [-nets {<netNames>} | -selected]  [-report <filename>]  [-use {all | signal | power | clock}] 
.P Verifies the process antenna effect (PAE) in multi-thread mode with geometry-based check through the advanced NanoRoute antenna checker feature. It also supports advanced antenna rules, such as LEF58_ANTENNADIFFGATEPWL and LEF58_ANTENNAMAXCUMAREA. This command supports checking antenna rules on the backside metal areas for both PG and signal nets.
.P Note: Before running this command, ensure that the process antenna or maximum floating area keywords are specified in the LEF file and the signal nets are routed. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verify_antenna parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man verify_antenna  "\fB-detailed\fR" Generates a report containing the PAE value for all layers of all the nets in a design, including those with no violations. If this parameter is not set, the report will include only those layers in the net that have violations.  Note: To know the point of violation in the report, use the * mark.  "\fB-error <integer>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of error messages to report.  Default: 1000  "\fB-nets {<netNames>}\fR" Reports the specified named nets. If you specify one net name, you do not need the braces around the name.  "\fB-report <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the report file. The file contains the PAE violation information.  Default: <design_name>.antenna.rpt  "\fB-selected\fR" Reports the specified selected nets. Select nets using the selectNet command. If you specify one net name, you do not need the braces around the name.   "\fB-use {all | signal | power | clock}\fR" Specifies the type of net to be checked. 
.SH Example
.P The following command verifies PAE violations in the routed design and generates a report file called Test7.antenna.rpt: verify_antenna -report Test7.antenna.rpt
