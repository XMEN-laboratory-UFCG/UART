.SH Name \fBdeleteBusGuide\fR \-  Deletes a bus guide
.SH Syntax \fBdeleteBusGuide\fR  [-help]   [-area <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>]   [-netGroup {<netGroup> | {<list_of_net_groups>}}]   [-layer {<id> | <id1>:<id2>}]   [-direction {H | V}]   [-all] 
.P Deletes a bus guide.
.P If you do not specify any option, by default, the command delete all the bus guide segments.
.P Use this command after creating a bus guide segment. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-all\fR" Deletes all bus guide segments in the design.  "\fB-area <x1><y1><x2><y2>\fR" Specifies the coordinates of the area from which the bus guide segments are deleted.  "\fB-direction {H | V}\fR" Specifies the direction of the bus guide segment to delete. This can be H (horizontal) or V (vertical).  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each deleteBusGuide parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man deleteBusGuide.  "\fB-layer {<id> | <id1>:<id2>}\fR" Specifies the layer or layer range from which bus guide segments are deleted.  The command deletes bus guide segments with the exact specified layer information and not a subset of it.  For example, for a bus guide segment with layer constraint 2:5 if you specify -layer 5, the segment is not deleted. To delete this guide segment you need to specify -layer 2:5 completely.  "\fB-netGroup {<netGroup>| {<list_of_net_groups>}}\fR" Specifies the name of the net group or list of net groups from which the bus guide segments are deleted.  You can also use wildcard (* or ?) for specifying the net group name. 
.SH Example
.P The following command deletes all the bus guide segments associated with the net group abcBus that has layer constraint from Metal 3 to Metal 7:
.P deleteBusGuide -netGroup abcBus -layer 3:7
