.P Creates a routing blockage object
. The object area prevents routing of specified metal layers, signal routes, and hierarchical instances in this area. Use this command during partition floorplanning. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createRouteBlk parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man createRouteBlk  "\fB-box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}   \fR" Specifies the coordinates of the blockage area.
.RS  "*" 2 x1: Specifies the lower left x coordinate of the blockage area.  "*" 2 y1: Specifies the lower left y coordinate of the blockage area.  "*" 2 x2: Specifies the upper right x coordinate of the blockage area.  "*" 2 y1: Specifies the upper right y coordinate of the blockage area.
.RE   Data_type: box, required  For example, the following command creates a routing blockage object on metal layers 1, 4, and 5:   createRouteBlk -box {0 0 100 100} -layer {metal1 metal4 metal5}   Note: You can also add variables to specify the blockage area. For example,  set box "0 0 100 100"  createRouteBlk -box $box   "\fB-boxList {{<x1 y1>} {<x2 y2>}...}\fR" Specifies the coordinates of a list of blockage areas.  Data_type: point_list, required  "\fB-cover\fR" Specifies that a routing blockage of the same size as the specified block instance (-inst <name>) will be created on top of the instance.  Note: The -inst parameter must be specified with this parameter.  Data_type: bool, required  "\fB-cutLayer <layerName> | {<layerNamelist
...>} | all\fR" Specifies the cut layer, list of cut layers, or all cut layers on which the routing blockage is to be applied. To specify cut layer between the first layer (e.g. metal1) and second layer (e.g. metal2), use the second layer name (e.g. metal2). For example, -cutLayer metal2. Similarly, if you want to create blockage on cut layer between the second layer (e.g. metal2) and third layer (e.g. metal3), use the third layer name (e.g. metal3). For example, -cutlayer metal3, and so on.  Note: The values specified with this parameter will override any default blockage layers specified with the setRouteBlkDefaultLayercommand.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the Innovus software will check if any default blockage layers have been specified with the setRouteBlkDefaultLayercommand. If yes, the layers specified with the setRouteBlkDefaultLayercommand will be used. If no, the default is metal3 if the number of layers is greater than 3, or metal2 if the number of layers is less than or equal to 3.  Data_type: list, optional  "\fB-designRuleWidth <float>\fR" Specifies the effective width of the blockage for the purposes of spacing calculations. If you specify -designRuleWidth, you cannot specify -spacing.   Type: The <effectiveWidth> is a real number greater than 0, in microns.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-drcRegionLayer <layerName>| {<layerNamelist
...>} | all\fR" Specifies the drc region layers, list of drc region layers, or all drc region layers on which the routing blockage is to be applied.  Data_type: list, optional   "\fB-exceptpgnet\fR" Specifies that the routing blockage is to be applied on a signal net routing and not on power or ground net routing. Use this option to block signal routing above or around a sensitive block to avoid noise from nearby signal nets but still allow power connections to go through the blockage.  Note: Blocking the signal net routing helps in avoiding crosstalk or coupling caused by signal routes.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-fills\fR" Specifies that the routing blockage is to be applied on metal fills.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-inst <name>\fR" Specifies the name of the instance on which the routing blockage is to be applied.  Note: When the -cover parameter is specified, the -inst parameter must also be specified. However, when the -inst parameter is specified then specifying the -cover option is optional.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-layer <layerName> | {<layerNamelist
...>} | all\fR" Specifies the layer, list of layers, or all layers on which the routing blockage is to be applied.  Note: The values specified with this parameter will override any default blockage layers specified with the setRouteBlkDefaultLayercommand.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the Innovus will check if any default blockage layers have been specified with the setRouteBlkDefaultLayercommand. If yes, the layers specified with the setRouteBlkDefaultLayercommand will be used. If no, the default is wire3 if the number of layers is greater than 3, or wire2 if the number of layers is less than or equal to 3.  Note: You must specify the layerName as a number or as a layer name defined in LEF. For example, layerName can be specified as 2 or metal2.  Data_type: list, optional   "\fB-mask <integer>\fR" Blocks routing layers with specified masks. Layers with other masks can still be routed through the blockage.  Note: 
.RS  "*" 2 The default value of the -mask parameter is 0. This implies that all the specified layers will be blocked.   "*" 2 If the -mask parameter is specified with an integer value greater than 0, then both layers with specified mask and uncolored layers are blocked.  Example. If -mask 1 is specified, it blocks mask 1 and uncolored routes.  "*" 2 If more than one layers are associated  with a mask, the mask is applied to all of them.  "*" 2 If the -mask parameter is specified, the tool checks if the mask is suitable for all of the specified layers. If not, it displays an ERROR message and no blockages are created.  The number of arguments specified with the -mask parameter must be same as the number of arguments specified with the  -layer, -cutLayer and -trimMetalLayer parameters.  "*" 2 The setNanoRouteMode and verify_drc commands honor the -mask parameter.
.RE   Default: 0  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-name <blk>\fR" Specifies the layer name of the route blockage.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-noWrongWay\fR" When this parameter is specified, wrong way routing is avoided in the region. Both router and verify_drc will report DRC if any jogs are present.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-partial <integer>\fR" Specifies the density for partial routing blockages. It causes the global router to only use up to the specified percent of the routing resource on the layer in the blockage area, so the global router will see higher congestion and put fewer routes on that layer in the area.  For example, -partial 75 means only 75% of routing resource in a gcell is available for global routing, and this will affect the final demand/supply values in the congestion map after routing. It is an integer in the range 0 to 100.  This can be useful if the router consistently creates too much congestion in a specific area. If you add a partial routing blockage in that area you can force the router to end up with less real congestion in that area. When there are overlapping partial routing blockages, the lowest density percentage of the blockages will be used in the overlapping region. For example, when a partial routing blockage with 75 percent density overlapping with another partial routing blockage with 50 percent density, the density of the overlapping region will be 50 percent.  Note: You can attach a partial routing blockage to a block instance with -inst if the congestion is related to the boundary and pins of a specific block.  Note:  The -designRuleWidth, -exceptpgnet, -pgnetonly, and -spacing parameters are not allowed for partial routing blockages.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 100  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-pgnetonly\fR" Specifies that the routing blockage is to be applied only on power or ground net special routes and not on signal nets. This option affects only commands that create special routes,such as addRing, addStripe, or sroute, when they are used for PG nets. NanoRoute, which is used to connect tie-high or tie-low connections or to connect to secondary standard-cell power-pin connections, is also not affected by this option. Use this option during power planning to prevent power routes from getting too close to block edges and, as a result, blocking signal pin access or causing congestion in narrow channels.  Note: This option cannot be used with -exceptpgnet.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-prefixOn\fR" Specifies that the routing blockages should be named with a prefix.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-polygon {{<x1 y1>} {<x2 y2>}...\fR" Specifies the polygon vertices of the blockage, in microns.  Note: Although createRouteBlk can be be used to create triangular blockages, metal fill does not currently support triangular route blockages.  Data_type: point_list, required  "\fB-spacing <float>\fR" Specifies the minimum spacing allowed between the blockage and any other routing shape. If you specify -spacing, you cannot specify -deignRuleWidth.  Type: The float is a real number greater than or equal to 0, in microns.  Note: When the blockage is of FILL type, the spacing property does not work. In that case, metal fill can still be abutted to the fill blockage.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-trimMetalLayer <layerName> | {<layerNamelist
...>} | all\fR" Specifies the trim metal layer, list of trim metal layers, or all trim metal layers on which the routing blockage is to be applied.  For example, the following command command creates routing blockages in trim metal layers Metal1 and Metal2.  createRouteBlk -trimMetalLayer {metal1 metal2
...}    Data_type: list, optional
