.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each prepareForEcoRoute parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man prepareForEcoRoute  "\fB-exclude <nets>\fR" Specifies the special nets that you do not want to convert. You can use wildcards.

.P prepareForEcoRoute <netName> [<netName2 netName3>
...] 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command converts special nets named clk* to regular nets:   prepareForEcoRoute -nets clk*

.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command converts special nets named clk* to regular nets, except nets named clk1*:   prepareForEcoRoute -nets clk* -exclude clk1*
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command converts all special nets named clk*, a2, and s2[1], except for nets clk1 and clk2, to regular nets:   prepareForEcoRoute -nets {clk* a2 s2[1]} -exclude {clk1 clk2}
