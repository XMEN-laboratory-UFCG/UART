.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_clock_trees\fR \-  This command returns the names of the clock trees whose names match the specified pattern
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_clock_trees\fR  [-help]  <pattern>   [-regexp] 
.P This command returns the names of the clock trees whose names match the specified pattern. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help     \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_ccopt_clock_trees parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man get_ccopt_clock_trees.   "\fB<pattern>\fR" Returns a list of clock trees that match this pattern.  The wildcard pattern, (*) matches zero or more characters. You can also use the question mark (?), which matches exactly one character.  "\fB-regexp\fR" When specified, treats all patterns as full Tcl regular expressions. If not specified, pattern is treated as a wildcard pattern.  
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command returns the list of all clock trees:   get_ccopt_clock_trees *  m_clk m_digit_clk m_dsram_clk m_ram_clk m_rcc_clk m_spi_clk refclk<1> refclkv    "*" 2 The following command returns the list of all clock trees that contain the word ram_clk, which is a Tcl pattern match:   get_ccopt_clock_trees ram_clk -regexp   m_dsram_clk m_ram_clk    "*" 2 The following command returns the list of all clock trees that start with "m", which is a wildcard match:  get_ccopt_clock_trees m*  m_clk m_digit_clk m_dsram_clk m_ram_clk m_rcc_clk m_spi_clk
