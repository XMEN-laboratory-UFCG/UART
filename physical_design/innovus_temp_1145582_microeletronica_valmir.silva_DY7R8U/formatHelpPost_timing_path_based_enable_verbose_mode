.TH timing_path_based_enable_verbose_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_path_based_enable_verbose_mode\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_path_based_enable_verbose_mode\fR <value> 
.P Default: 1
.P Controls printing of verbose messages during and at the end of path-based analysis (PBA).  
.P You can specify one of the three values - 0, 1, and 2. These are described below:
.RS  "*" 2 0: Verbose messages are not reported during exhaustive PBA analysis. For default PBA analysis, the path count will be reported.  "*" 2 1: Reports the final message for PBA path count and max depth reached during exhaustive PBA. Progress messages are not reported.  "*" 2 2: Reports multiple progress messages after regular intervals (in addition to the final message for PBA path count and max depth).
.RE
.P This global variable impacts messages when the report_timing and report_constraint commands are used in PBA mode.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
