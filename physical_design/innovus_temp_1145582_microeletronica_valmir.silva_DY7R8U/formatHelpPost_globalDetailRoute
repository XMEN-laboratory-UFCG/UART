.SH Name \fBglobalDetailRoute\fR \-  Uses the NanoRoute router to perform both global and detailed routing with one command
.SH Syntax \fBglobalDetailRoute\fR  [-help]  [-select]   [<area>]  
.P Uses the NanoRoute router to perform both global and detailed routing with one command. When you load a partially routed database, the router completes the routes.
.RS  "*" 2 To perform global routing only, use globalRoute.  "*" 2 To perform detailed routing only, use detailRoute.
.RE
.P This command supports multiple-CPU processing.
.P Use this command after completing the following steps:
.RS  "*" 2 Placing the design.  "*" 2 Routing special nets.  "*" 2 Setting net attributes with setAttribute command, and NanoRoute run-time options with setNanoRouteMode command.
.RE
.P Note: To use NanoRoute current values for attributes, and default values for options, this step is optional. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<area>\fR" Specifies the coordinates  (x1 y1 x2 y2) of the bounding box area for detailed routing. The entire design is globally routed.  Data_type: rect, optional   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each globalDetailRoute parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man globalDetailRoute  "\fB-select\fR" Routes selected nets. To select a net, use the selectNetcommand or click the net in the design display window.  Tip: You can also specify setNanoRouteMode -route_selected_net_only true to route the selected nets.  Data_type: bool, optional
.P Note: If you have not already run detailed routing on the entire design, you cannot run detailed routing on a specified area. 
.SH Example
.P The following commands run global and detailed routing, save the design as droute, and generate a routed DEF file named droute.def.
.P globalDetailRoute  saveDesign droute  defOut -floorplan -placement -routing droute.def
