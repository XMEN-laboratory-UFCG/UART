.TH scanTrace  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBscanTrace\fR \-  Records the total number of elements in the scan chain in the log file, and records the starting and ending scan points if the -verbose option is used. The scanReorder command automatically calls scanTrace internally if you have not previously run scanTrace
.SH Syntax \fBscanTrace\fR   [-help]  [-compLogic | -noCompLogic]  [-lockup | -noLockup]  [-verbose]
.P Records the total number of elements in the scan chain in the log file, and records the starting and ending scan points if the -verbose option is used. The scanReorder command automatically calls scanTrace internally if you have not previously run scanTrace.
.P Note: If scan chains are specified by reading in a DEF file, the software does a native scan trace. The scan DEF file is stored in the database and, when the scanReorder command runs, the software matches the scans and honors the ordered sections. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-compLogic\fR" Traces through multiple input gate on the scan path.  "\fB-noCompLogic\fR" Does not trace through multiple input gate on the scan path.   "\fB-lockup\fR" Specifies that the tracing detects lockup latches automatically.  Note: If the lockup elements are flops (non scan flip-flops), the lockup elements must be identified using the specifyLockupElement command prior to running scanTrace in its default mode.  "\fB-noLockup\fR" Specifies that the tracing will not detect lockup elements. This is the default.  "\fB-verbose\fR" Prints the information stored in the logv file, i.e starting and ending scan points, and the cell instance names that scanTrace determines are part of the scan chain. If scan chain tracing fails, use this parameter to see where the scan chain tracing stops. 
.SH Command Order
.P Use this command after specifying scan chains using the specifyScanChain command. 
.SH Examples
.P The following set of commands traces all scan chains defined by specifyScanChian command:
.P specifyScanChain chain0 -start BG_scan_in_1 -stop BG_scan_out_1   specifyScanChain chain1 -start BG_scan_in_2 -stop BG_scan_out_2   specifyScanChain chain2 -start BG_scan_in_3 -stop BG_scan_out_3   scanTrace
