.SH Name \fBsetDistributeHost\fR \-  Specifies the multiple-CPU processing configuration for distributed processing or Superthreading
.SH Syntax \fBsetDistributeHost\fR   [-help]  [-add <string>]  [-args <string>]   [-custom]  [-custom_script <string>]  [-custom_script_list <string>]  [-local]  [-lsf]   [-nc]  [-noWaitTaskComeUp]  [-queue <string>]  [-remove <string>]  [-reportLsfInfo]  [-resource <string>]  [-rsh]  [-shellTimeout <integer>]  [-single_cpu_lsf_args <string>]  [-ssh]   [-timeOut <integer>]   [-env_script <string>] 
.P Specifies the multiple-CPU processing configuration for distributed processing or Superthreading. The software finds hosts from the last setDistributeHost command specified before a distributed processing or Superthreading command starts.
.P Use getDistributeHost to display the current settings for the setDistributeHost command.   Note: This command is required for distributed processing and Superthreading.
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-add <string>\fR" Adds the specified hosts to the rsh/ssh configuration. If you specify more than one host, separate each host name with a space.  Each time you specify a host, the software uses it to run one client process. To run more than one client process on a host, specify it more than once. For example, if you have two machines that each has two CPUs and you want to use both CPUs in both machines, type a command like the following:  setDistributeHost -rsh -add {<machine1> <machine2>\\       <machine1> <machine2>}  "\fB-args <string>\fR" Specifies any additional arguments you need to provide to the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) or Load Sharing Facility (LSF) job submission command.  "\fB-custom\fR" Specifies to use the custom job submission script for distributed processing.  "\fB-custom_script <string>\fR" Specifies a custom script to run distributed processing.  You can use this parameter with -custom only.  "\fB-custom_script_list <string>\fR" Specifies to customize the launch of multiple jobs, based on resources required for these jobs. This parameter allows you to specify multiple launch strings in order of priority with a maximum allowed job count for each string.  If you request for N number of jobs, the command starts submitting jobs starting from <string1>, until the corresponding count is reached, at which point it starts submitting the next string in the list. Therefore, the command submits the first "<count1>" jobs with <string1>, the next "<count2>" jobs with <string2> and so on. It stops when the total submitted jobs has reached the requested number (N).  Note: This parameter can only be specified with the -custom parameter.  "\fB-env_script <string> \fR" Specifies a user-defined shell environment script that is run for each of the slave hosts. The parameter allows you to pass these environment settings to the slave hosts by including them in the shell environment script. The license variables used by the software are also automatically passed to the slave hosts to avoid license errors.   "\fB-local\fR" Runs all distributed processing jobs on the master machine.  "\fB-lsf\fR" Specifies a Load Sharing Facility configuration. If you do not specify any parameters for -lsf , the software uses default settings.  Note: To use this parameter, LSF must already be set up (typically by specifying the LSF_ENVDIR and LSF_SERVERDIR environment variables) and bsub must be in your search path. Contact your LSF administrator for details.  "\fB-nc\fR" Uses NC commands (Network Computer from RTDA) for distributed processing.  "\fB-noWaitTaskComeUp\fR" Does not allow the software to wait for tasks that are delayed or are not likely to occur.   "\fB-queue <string>  \fR" Specifies the queue for the LSF or SGE configuration.  "\fB-remove <string>\fR" Removes the specified hosts or all hosts from the rsh/ssh configuration. If you specify more than one host, separate each host name with a space.  "\fB-reportLsfInfo\fR" Specifies to report LSF information in a single report. This parameter allows you to collect the system statistics on the status of the distributed jobs. It has the following information:
.RS  "*" 2 Host name for master and LSF tasks  "*" 2 Number of CPUs on each machine that are being used by a process  "*" 2 Job ID/PID for each task process  "*" 2 Total memory used on each machine  "*" 2 Total virtual memory used on each machine  "*" 2 Total CPU time used on each machine
.RE   You must specify this parameter with the -lsf parameter.  To get the LSF information, specify the getDistributeHost -reportLsfInfo command parameter. You must specify the getDistributeHost -reportLsfInfo only after the LSF tasks exit to obtain the task CPU time. If you specify this command before the task exits, the command gives a warning message.  "\fB-resource <string>\fR" Specifies a resource string for the SGE or LSF queue.  Note: The correct resource string is specific to your installation. Contact your LSF administrator for the appropriate parameters and values.   "\fB-rsh\fR" Specifies a remote shell configuration. For information, see the rsh documentation.  "\fB-shellTimeout<integer>\fR" Specifies the number of seconds the host machine waits for rsh/ssh machines to become available for multiple-CPU processing.  Default: 5  "\fB-single_cpu_lsf_args <string>  \fR" Specifies the bsub options. For information, see the LSF documentation.  Note: You must use this parameter to adjust the LSF argument for a single CPU application. Alternatively, use the -args parameter to adjust the LSF argument for an application that runs in the Superthreading mode.  "\fB-ssh\fR" Specifies a secure shell configuration.   "\fB-timeout <integer>\fR" Specifies the default timeout for a submitted job that will never start. This functionality prevents the master machine from hanging when the clients do not come up for some reason.  After timeout, a warning message appears informing you that the distributed CPUs did not come online within the expected time. The master will continue waiting for the clients and it is up to you to continue waiting or kill the run if there are problems with the Distributed Resource Management (DRM) system.  A sample warning message is given below:  Task id 2 did not come up within the specified timeout period (300 seconds). Use setDistributeHost -timeout to change the value. This may be a real error due to incorrect or incomplete platform/machine specification provided via setDistributeHost to your distributed resource management system (LSF/Sun Grid Engine etc.). If running locally (setDistributeHost -local), the current machine may be overloaded with too many jobs and swapping (check free memory and CPUs with top). For local runs, consider reducing the number of CPUs you are using via the setMultiCpuUsage command or free up some memory by killing other memory intensive processes.  Default: 3600 for all the modes (LSF, NC, SGE, RSH, SSH, local and custom  Note: When the set_distribute_host command is not specified, the software sets the default mode as local and the EDP timeout is 3600 seconds. 
.SH Examples 
.SH rsh
.P The following command creates an rsh configuration and adds hosts host10, host11, and host12:
.P setDistributeHost -rsh -add {host10 host11 host12}
.P The following commands create an rsh configuration with host1 and host2 as remote hosts and then adds host3 and host4 to the configuration:
.P setDistributeHost -rsh -add {host1 host2}   setDistributeHost -rsh -add {host3 host4} 
.SH LSF
.P The following command uses an existing LSF environment, and relies on the general LSF set up by the system administrator. In this example, the name of the queue implies that all the machines have 4 Gb of memory.
.P setDistributeHost -lsf -queue mem4G
.P The following command schedules a LSF job named bigQueue to run on a Linux machine for a maximum of 30 minutes. No other jobs can run on the machine while bigQueue is running.
.P setDistributeHost -lsf -queue bigQueue -args {-x -W 30} \\      -resource {OSNAME==Linux}
.P The following command schedules a LSF job named smallQueue to run on Linux machines with minimum speed of 2000 MHz.
.P setDistributeHost -lsf -queue smallQueue -args {-W 20} \\       -resource {OSNAME==Linux && SPEED>2000}
.P Note: Check with your LSF administrator for the correct values for the resource string, as the parameters and their values differ in each installation. For example, the parameter name for the speed of the machine might be MHZ instead of SPEED (as in the preceding example), and the units might be specified in gigahertz instead of megahertz.
.P The following command specifies to report LSF information:
.P setDistributeHost -lsf -args "-q lnx64" -reportLsfInfo   getDistributeHost -reportLsfInfo lsf.log 
.P Note: Use the above two commands together to save the LSF information in the specified file. 
.SH Local
.P The following command runs all distributed processing jobs on the machine on which you are running the master version of the software:
.P setDistributeHost -local 
.SH Custom
.P The following command runs distributed processing with a custom script:
.P setDistributeHost -custom -custom_script {bsub -q bigQueue -x -R "OS==Linux && memory>20000"} 
.P The following command runs distributed processing with a custom script list:  setDistributeHost -custom -custom_script_list {{{bsub -P ICD -W 2 -q admin -R "OSNAME==Linux && OSREL==EE50"}1} {{rsh hpc1 -e} 1}} 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command allows the client to source the my_env_file before start up on the same machine:   setDistributeHost -local -env_script my_env_file  This command allows the master to pass on the user-defined environment settings.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command allows the client to run using the LSF:   setDistributeHost -lsf -noWaitTaskComeUp  When the -noWaitTaskComeUp parameter is specified, the software will not wait for all the clients to come up when parts of the clients are launching timeout.
