.P Takes an Innovus database and a modified netlist as input and performs ECO operations. It restores the design, examines the changes in the new netlist, and automatically implements the required changes with ecoPlace and ecoRoute. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each ecoDesign.   For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man ecoDesign  "\fB-1801File <new1801File>\fR" Specifies the name of the new 1801 file.   "\fB-allow_to_load_binary_timing_file\fR" Allows the tool to load the binary timing graph or the timing constraint file.  If you execute ecoDesign based on binary timing graph or timing constraints, the tool will give an error and stop loading the new design. This is because the timing graph or the timing constraints file from the loaded design is a binary file, and if you keep on loading it, it may cause fatal error. In such a case, you need to restore the original design and then save a new design with the no-binary timing file. Then, execute ecoDesign based on the new design. If you still want to load the current design, you need to run ecoDesign -allow_to_load_binary_timing_file 1 to turn on the control.  "\fB-addHierPortForTieOff\fR" Allows the added tie cells to connect to the tie pins across hierarchical boundaries if other constraints, such as maximum fanout and maximum distance, allow it.  This parameter can be used only with -postMask and -tieCell options.  "\fB-cpfFile <newCPFFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the CPF file.   "\fB-def <fileName>\fR" Specifies the DEF file you want the software to load automatically when performing ECO. This parameter automatically assigns the location of the new ECO cells. As a result, you do not need to run ecoPlace after performing the ECO.  "\fB<design>\fR" Specifies the top cell name of the design.   "\fB-ecoMMMC <newMMMCFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the new view definition file.   "\fB-ecoSDC <newSDCFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the new SDC file.  "\fB-fillerPrefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies the filler cell instance prefix. The ecoDesign command removes all filler cells before placing the ECOs. If you do not specify a prefix, deleteFiller removes filler instances based on the setFillerMode command settings. If you have not set setFillerMode, then no filler cells are removed.  "\fB-keepInstLoc\fR" Keeps the instance location of changed cells.   "\fB-lef_files <LEFFilesName>\fR" Specifies the LEF files name for loading. Use this option if you want to replace the existing LEF files in the original design with new LEF files. Refer to restoreDesign -lef_files for more details and limitations.  For example, tech.lef, A.lef are the existing LEFs used in original design. You can change A.lef to A_v2.lef using the following command:   ecoDesign original.enc.dat myDesign myDesign.new.v -lef_files {tech.lef A_v2.lef}  "\fB-noAddFiller\fR" Skips filler insertion in the pre-mask eco flow.   "\fB-modifyOnlyLayers MLb:MLt\fR" Specifies the layers to be modified during the ECO process.  "\fB<newNetList>\fR" Specifies the name of new netlist file.   "\fB-noDeleteFiller \fR" Skips deleting filler.   "\fB-noEcoPlace\fR" Prevents placement and routing during the ECO process. ecoPlace and/or ecoRoute must run manually based on the design's needs.  "\fB-noEcoRoute\fR" Prevents routing during the ECO process.  "\fB-noTiming\fR" Ignores timing libraries and MMMC configuration   "\fB-postMask\fR" Specifies that the changes are being made on a post-mask design.  -postMask is required when option -suffix, -spareCells, -modifyOnlyLayers, -tieCell, or -addHierPortForTieOff is specified.  "\fB-reportFile <reportFile      >\fR" Specifies the name of the report file.  Note: By default, ecoDesign creates the default ecoRestoreDesign.rpt file. However, this default file will be overwritten by the file name specified using the -reportFile option in next eco RUN.  "\fB<sessionDirectory>\fR" Specifies the
.dat directory from which to load the files.  "\fB-skipCcopt\fR" Skips restore ccopt config for signoffTimeDesign.   "\fB-spareCells <spareCellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the spare cell to use during the ECO process.  "\fB-suffix <suffix>\fR" Specifies the suffix to be appended to the spare cells. You can specify this parameter only if you specify -postMask.  Default: _SPARE  "\fB-tieCell "<cellName1> <cellName2>"\fR" Specifies the existing tie cells to be reused to make tie connections for newly created SPARE instance in the design. You can only specify a maximum of two tie-cells, where one cell must be a tie-high driver, and the other a tie-low driver. The two tie-cell names must be surrounded by quotation marks.  This parameter can be used only with -postMask option.  "\fB-useGACells <GA_site>\fR" Specifies the site name of the GA cell. Check the site name defined in the LEF file.  "\fB-useGAFillerCells <list_of_filler_cells>\fR" Specifies a list of Gate Array (GA)-style filler cells that the tool can replace with GA cells during post-mask ECO. You can only use this parameter in a post-mask ECO flow.  Note: You cannot specify the -useGACells parameter if you use this parameter.
