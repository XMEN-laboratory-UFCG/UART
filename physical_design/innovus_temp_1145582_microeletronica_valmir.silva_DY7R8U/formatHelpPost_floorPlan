.SH Name \fBfloorPlan\fR \-  Specifies the floorplan dimensions by size; or by die, I/O, or core coordinates. The floorPlan command initializes the floorplan and calls the add_trackscommand to create new routing tracks

.P Specifies the floorplan dimensions by size; or by die, I/O, or core coordinates. The floorPlan command initializes the floorplan and calls the add_trackscommand to create new routing tracks. By default  the add_tracks command calculates the optimum spacing between tracks and ignores the pitch values in the tech LEF.  When you use the Specify Floorplan form (or specify the floorplan through the floorplan command), the floorplan is resized automatically- relatively floorplan constraints are automatically derived on the fly for blocks, fixed standard cells, fixed pre-routes, and blockages.
.P The floorplan is linearly adjusted as follows:
.RS  "*" 2 Spacing among blocks is evenly adjusted  "*" 2 The size of the modules and black boxes is evenly adjusted.  "*" 2 The fixed pre-routes and I/Os are automatically adjusted.
.RE
.P Note: The floorPlan command checks if the specified IO box and core box is within limits of die box and displays an error message if they are outside the die box. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-adjustToSite\fR" Adjusts the width of the die area such that it is an integer multiple of the width of the IO site or core site.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-b {<die_box io_box core_box>}\fR" Specifies all three boxes of the floorplan, die_box, io_box, core_box.  The following command creates floorplan by specifying a core box size of 1200 x 1200,io box size of 1600 x 1600  and die box size of 2000 x 2000.  floorPlan -b {0 0 2000 2000 200 200 1800 1800 400 400 1600 1600}   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: list, required  "\fB-coreMarginsBy {io | die}\fR" Specifies whether the core margins are calculated using the core-to-IO boundary or the core-to-die boundary.  Default: io  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB -d {<W H Left Bottom Right Top>}\fR" Specifies the die size and the spacing, in micrometers, between the die edge, which is the margin between the outside edge of the die.
.RS  "*" 2 W: Specifies the die's width value.  "*" 2 H: Specifies the die's height value.  "*" 2 Left: Specifies the margin from the outside edge of the core to the left of the I/O boundary.  "*" 2 Bottom: Specifies the margin from the outside edge of the core to the bottom of the I/O boundary.  "*" 2 Right: Specifies the margin from the outside edge of the core to the right of the I/O boundary.  "*" 2 Top: Specifies the margin from the outside edge of the core to the top of the I/O boundary.  The following command creates floorplan by specifying a die box size of 1500 x 1500,and the spacing between core edge to each die edge of 300.  floorPlan -d {1500 1500 300 300 300 300}  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE   Data_type: list, required  "\fB-dieSizeByIoHeight {min | max}\fR" Specifies whether the maximum I/O height or the minimum I/O height should be used for die size calculation.  Default: min  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-flip {f | s | n}\fR" Specifies the orientation of the bottom row in the core area.
.RS  "*" 2 f: Specifies that the first row flips from the bottom up.  "*" 2 n: Specifies no row flipping.  "*" 2 s: Specifies that the second row flips from the bottom up.
.RE   floorPlan -b {0 0 2000 2000 200 200 1800 1800 400 400 1600 1600} -flip f  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   floorPlan -b {0 0 2000 2000 200 200 1800 1800 400 400 1600 1600} -flip s  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  floorPlan -b {0 0 2000 2000 200 200 1800 1800 400 400 1600 1600} -flip n  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Default: <f>   Data_type: enum, optional   "\fB-fplanOrigin {center | llcorner}\fR" Specifies whether the origin of the floorplan should be at the center or at the lower left corner.  Default: llcorner (lower left corner)  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each floorplan parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man floorplan  "\fB-keepShape <util>  \fR" Specifies the target utilization after resize.  Data_type: float, required  "\fB-noResize\fR" Checks if there is a need to do floorplan if everything is the same.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noSnapToGrid\fR" Specifies that the core box (or die box) boundary will not be snapped to the nearest metal pitch even if the if the specified die/ core box size is not an integer multiple of the smallest metal pitch. This prevents the input floorplan boxes from being changed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-overlapSameSiteRow\fR" Specifies that same-site rows can overlap with one another. Single height rows must not overlap. Only double or multiple-height rows can overlap, and in sections that are multiple of single height any other overlap section size will cause the rows to be ignored.  Example: floorPlan -s {1000 1000 300 300 300 300} -overlapSameSiteRow  Before:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)

Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-r {<aspectRatio>[<rowDensity> [<Left Bottom Right Top>]]}\fR" Specifies the chip's core dimensions as the ratio of the height divided by the width. If a value of 1.0 is used, a square chip is defined. A value of 2.0 will define a   rectangular chip with height dimension that is twice the width dimension.
