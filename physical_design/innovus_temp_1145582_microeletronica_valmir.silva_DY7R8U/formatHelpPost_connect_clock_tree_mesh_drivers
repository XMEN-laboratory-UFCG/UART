.SH Name \fBconnect_clock_tree_mesh_drivers\fR \-  Uses the specified set of drivers and merges the nets at their outputs to form a single multi-driven net
.SH Syntax \fBconnect_clock_tree_mesh_drivers\fR  [-help]  [-driver_pins <pin_names>]  [-driver_source_group <source_group_name>]
.P Uses the specified set of drivers and merges the nets at their outputs to form a single multi-driven net. To run this command successfully, one of the two options, -driver_pins or -driver_source_group must be specified.
.P It is possible that some or all of the driver pin nets are already multi-drive. You might be repeating the same command, or you could be merging additional drivers into an already multi-drive net. Running the command twice does nothing the second time. If the net of any driver pin is already multi-drive, the pin list will be interpreted to include all drivers of that net.
.P The command returns the resulting merged net through a Tcl return value. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help  \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each connect_clock_tree_mesh_drivers parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man connect_clock_tree_mesh_drivers.   "\fB-driver_pins <pin_names>\fR" Specifies a list of driver output pins whose nets will be merged to form a multi-drive mesh net.   Note: This parameter is optional if the -driver_source_group parameter is specified.  "\fB-driver_source_group <source_group_name>\fR" Specifies the source group for the list of driver output pins. Only the root pins of the specified source group will be included in the list of driver output pins.  Note: This parameter is optional if the -driver_pins parameter is specified.
