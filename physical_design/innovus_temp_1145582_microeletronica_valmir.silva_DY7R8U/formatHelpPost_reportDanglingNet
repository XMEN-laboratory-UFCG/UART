.TH reportDanglingNet  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreportDanglingNet\fR \-  Reports the number of nets with zero terms, including the PG nets
.SH Syntax \fBreportDanglingNet\fR  [-help]  [-outfile <fileName>]
.P Reports the number of nets with zero terms, including the PG nets. This command can also be used to report the number of dangling nets, which could or could not be removed by the deleteDanglingNet command. The command reports the following information, when used:
.RS  "*" 2 Total number of nets  "*" 2 Number of dangling nets  "*" 2 Number of removable dangling nets  "*" 2 Number of non-removable dangling nets
.RE
.P The removable and non-removable nets are reported based on the usage of the deleteDanglingNet command. Those dangling nets, which could not be removed by the deleteDanglingNet command, are reported in the output file due to multiple possible reasons, such as the dangling net:
.RS  "*" 2 The dangling net is a physical net.  "*" 2 The dangling net is a PG net.  "*" 2 The dangling net is a bus bit net.  "*" 2 The dangling net is an assign net.  "*" 2 The dangling net has multiple module ports and at least one port is associated with some constraints.  "*" 2 The dangling net itself has some constraints, like an ILM module or some timing constraints.
.RE
.P Note: If a dangling net cannot be deleted due to any reason, only the first reason listed above will be reported in the output file. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each reportDanglingNet parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man reportDanglingNet  "\fB-outfile <fileName>  \fR" Reports the list of dangling nets that cannot be deleted by the delete_floating_nets command, along with its reasons.
