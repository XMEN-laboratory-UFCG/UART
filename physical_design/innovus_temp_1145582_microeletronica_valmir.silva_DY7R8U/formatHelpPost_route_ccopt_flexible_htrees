.SH Name \fBroute_ccopt_flexible_htrees\fR \-  Routes CCOpt flexible h-tree nets as a separate step after running the synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees command
.SH Syntax \fBroute_ccopt_flexible_htrees\fR  [-help]  [nets <net>+] 
.P Routes CCOpt flexible h-tree nets as a separate step after running the synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees command. The following use models are supported:
.RS  "*" 2 Routing during H-tree syntheses: 
.RS  "*" 2 create_ccopt_flexible_htree  "*" 2 synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees
.RE  "*" 2 Routing after H-tree synthesis (block level)
.RS  "*" 2 create_ccopt_flexible_htree  "*" 2 synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees -use_estimated_routes  "*" 2 route_ccopt_flexible_htrees

.P Note: When using this command, the software expects the input routes of nets in the flexible H-tree to be fully connected, as it is the case for routes generated by synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees -use_estimated_routes. If this expectation is not met, then unexpected results such as open nets may occur and you should check for connectivity-related warnings in the log file. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help   \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each route_ccopt_flexible_htrees parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man route_ccopt_flexible_htrees.   "\fB-nets <net>+\fR" Specifies a list of flexible h-tree nets to route. The specified nets must all have been created by the synthesize_ccopt_flexible_htrees command.  By default, the software automatically determines all the flexible h-tree nets that need to be routed.
