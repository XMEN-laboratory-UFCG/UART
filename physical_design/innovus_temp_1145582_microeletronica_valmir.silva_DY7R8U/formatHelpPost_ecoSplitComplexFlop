.SH Name \fBecoSplitComplexFlop\fR \-  Splits a complex flip-flop into a simple flip-flop and combinational logic for the specified instance
.SH Syntax \fBecoSplitComplexFlop\fR  [-help]   [-force]  {-inst {<inst1>, <inst2>,...} | -listFile <instNamesFile>| -all}  [-legal]  [-preCTS | -postCTS | -postRoute]  [-power]  [-skipRoute]
.P Splits a complex flip-flop into a simple flip-flop and combinational logic for the specified instance. A complex flip-flop means the D side has some combinational logic, such as AND, OR, MUX, AOI, and so on. By default, a specific flip-flop is split only if equivalent simple flip-flops and combinational logic can be found in libraries and there is timing gain or power gain after the split.
.P You can also specify that the split flip-flops should be placed in legal locations. By default, the positions of the split flip-flops are not guaranteed to be legal. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each ecoSplitComplexFlop parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man ecoSplitComplexFlop  "\fB-all\fR" Specifies that all flop instances in the design should be processed.  Note: The -inst, -listFile, and -all parameters are mutually exclusive. One of these parameters must be specified.  "\fB-force\fR" When specified, forces the complex flip-flops to split regardless of the timing gains.  "\fB-inst {<inst1, inst2,...>} \fR" Specifies the names of the flop instances to be split. You can specify a single instance or a tcl list of instances to be split.  Note: The -inst, -listFile, and -all parameters are mutually exclusive. One of these parameters must be specified.  "\fB-listFile <instNamesFile>\fR" Specifies the file containing the names of the flop instances to be split. Specify one instance on one line. Comment with #. Instance name should not contain spaces or backslashes.  Note: The -inst, -listFile, and -all parameters are mutually exclusive. One of these parameters must be specified.  "\fB-legal\fR" When specified, places the split flip-flops and combinational cells at a legal location.  "\fB-preCTS\fR" Specify this parameter, if the design stage is preCTS.  "\fB-postCTS\fR" Specify this parameter, if the design stage is postCTS.   "\fB-postRoute\fR" Specify this parameter, if the design stage is postRoute.   "\fB-power\fR" When specified, complex flops are split to reclaim power.   By default, the flops are split for timing.  "\fB-skipRoute\fR" Skip globalDetailRoute after split in postRoute stage.  
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following command to force the flip-flop split for power for all instances during the preCTS stage.  ecoSplitComplexFlop -force -preCTS -power -all  "*" 2 Use the following command for flip-flop split for timing for the instance ff1 during the preCTS stage.  ecoSplitComplexFlop -inst ff1 -preCTS
