.SH Name \fBplaceJtag\fR \-  Places JTAG cells
.SH Syntax \fBplaceJtag\fR  [-help]  -nrRow <nrRow>  [-nrRowTop <nrRowTop>]   [-nrRowBottom <nrRowBottom>]   [-nrRowLeft <nrRowLeft>]   [-nrRowRight <nrRowRight>]  [-hardMacro {true | false}]  [-areaIo {true | false}]  [-ioNetWeight <netWtValue>]  [-blockNetWeight <netWtValue>]   [-contour {true | false}]  [-ignoreScan {true | false}]  [-orientTop <orientation>]  [-orientBottom <orientation>]  [-orientLeft <orientation>]  [-orientRight <orientation>] 
.P Places JTAG cells. Use this command for JTAG and other cells where placement is required to be close to the perimeter I/Os.
.P Note: The command does not honor MSMV design. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-areaIo {true | false}\fR" Considers the area around I/O cells as a legal placement location. When specifying this parameter, the -ioNetWeight parameter is applied to the nets that are connected to the Area I/O cells.  Default: false  "\fB-blockNetWeight <netWtValue>\fR" Specifies the weight for nets connecting to blocks. This allows placeJtag to place more critical block nets in a smaller area.  Default: 20  Maximum value: 512  "\fB-contour {true | false}\fR" Creates an outline along the boundary of the chip, with its width based on the number of standard cell rows, as specified by the -nrRow parameter(s). You can specify different values for -nrRowTop, -nrRowBottom, -nrRowLeft, and -nrRowRight.  Default: false  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each placeJtag parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man placeJtag.  "\fB-hardMacro {true | false}\fR" Includes the boundaries of the hard macros in the JTAG placement.  Default: false  "\fB-ignoreScan {true | false}\fR" Ignores all scan-in pins, scan enable pins, clock pins, and asynchronous control pins.  Default: false  Note: placeJtag relies on the timing library to provide information, such as what pins are scan-in, scan enable, clk, and async control. If the timing library does not have the scan-in and scan enable information, placeJtag is not able to ignore them. In this case, before you run placeJtag, you must specify those terms using the specifyScanCell command.   "\fB-ioNetWeight <netWtValue>\fR" Specifies the weight for nets connecting to I/Os. This allows placeJtag to place more critical I/O nets in a smaller area.  Default: 100  Maximum: 512  -ioNetWeight applies to the nets that are connected to any I/O cell, whether it is a standard peripheral I/O cell or an Area I/O cell. This behavior is different from -blockNetWeight, which specifies the weight of the nets connected to blocks separately from the I/O nets.   "\fB-nrRow nrRow  \fR" Specifies the number of standard cell rows to place the JTAG instances.   "\fB-nrRowBottom <nrRowBottom>\fR" Specifies the number of standard cell rows at the bottom of the core area to place JTAG logic.  "\fB-nrRowLeft <nrRowLeft>\fR" Specifies the number of standard cell row heights at the left of the core area to place JTAG logic.  "\fB-nrRowRight <nrRowRight>\fR" Specifies the number of standard cell row heights at the right of the core area to place JTAG logic.  "\fB-nrRowTop <nrRowTop>\fR" Specifies the number of standard cell rows at the top of the core area to place JTAG logic.  "\fB-orientBottom <orientation>\fR" Considers the specified orientation at each side first and then looks for other legal orientations. Specify one of the following values: R0 R90 R180 R270 MX MX90 MY MY90.  "\fB-orientLeft <orientation>\fR" Considers the specified orientation at each side first and then looks for other legal orientations. Specify one of the following values: R0 R90 R180 R270 MX MX90 MY MY90.  "\fB-orientRight <orientation>\fR" Considers the specified orientation at each side first and then looks for other legal orientations. Specify one of the following values: R0 R90 R180 R270 MX MX90 MY MY90.  "\fB-orientTop <orientation>\fR" Considers the specified orientation at each side first and then looks for other legal orientations. Specify one of the following values: R0 R90 R180 R270 MX MX90 MY MY90. 
.SH Examples
.P The following command places the JTAG instances within four standard cell rows at the top and bottom of the chip and within four times the standard cell row height at the sides of the chip:
.P placeJtag -nrRow 4
.P The following command places the JTAG instances within ten standard cell rows at the top and bottom of the chip and within ten times the standard cell row height at the sides of the chip. It increases the I/O net weight to 256.
.P placeJtag -nrRow 10 -ioNetWeight 256
