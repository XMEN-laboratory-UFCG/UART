.SH Name \fBaddHaloToBlock\fR \-  Adds a halo to a block
.SH Syntax \fBaddHaloToBlock\fR   [-help]  <left bottom right top>  [-fromInstBox]   [-snapToSite]   [-ori <orientation>]   [<inst_name> |-allMacro | -allBlackBox | -allCommitPtn | -allBlock | -allIOPad | -cell <name>]
.P Adds a halo to a block. A halo is an area that prevents the placement of blocks and standard cells within the specified halo distance from the edges of a hard macro, black box, or committed partition in order to reduce congestion. A block halo value is specified based on the current block orientation. Use this command during or after floorplanning. You can use the deleteHaloFromBlock command to delete halos. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-allBlackBox\fR" Specifies halo values for all black boxes.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-allBlock\fR" Specifies halo values for all hard macros, black boxes, and committed partitions.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-allCommitPtn\fR" Specifies halo values for all committed partitions.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-allIOPad\fR" Specifies halo values for all IO pads.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-allMacro\fR" Specifies halo values for all hard macros.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-cell <name>\fR" Specifies halo values for all instances of a cell.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-fromInstBox\fR" Creates a block halo, based on the instance boundary, even when there is an overlap layer defined in the block cell or macro definition.  Note: This parameter is for backward compatibility only. Cadence does not recommend the use of this parameter because there can be problems with the defin flow if this parameter is specified and if the block cell or the macro has overlap layers.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each addHaloToBlock parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man addHaloToBlock  "\fB<inst_name>\fR" Specifies the block where the halo is to be added. You can use wildcards (* or ?) for specifying instance names.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB<left bottom right top>\fR" Specifies the halo width on 4 sides. These values are floats, units are microns. Halo deltas are specified in relation to a block in R0 orientation (left is applied to the left edge of block oriented R0). For non-R0, the halo deltas are rotated/flipped according to the blocks's orientation (for block oriented MY, the left halo delta specifies the width of the halo along the right side of the inst in the floorplan).
.RS  "*" 2 left: the width of the halo along the left edge of insts having halos added.  "*" 2 bottom: the width of the halo along the bottom edge of objects having halos added.  "*" 2 right: the width of the halo along the right edge of objects having halos added.  "*" 2 top: the width of the halo along the top edge of objects having halos added.
.RE   Data_type: box, required  "\fB-ori <orientation>\fR" Specifies the orientation value of the instances to which the block halo values are applied. The orientation value can be R0, R90, R180, R270, MX, MX90, MY, or MY90.  Note: If the orientation is not set, the halo will be added with the current orientation of the macro.   Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-snapToSite\fR" Snaps the halo box to a site.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command adds a halo around block xy_inst:  addHaloToBlock 10 20 30 40 xy_inst   If xy_inst is R0, the halo width is 10 along the left edge and 30 along the right edge. If the block is MY, the halo width is 30 along the left edge in the floorplan, and 10 along the right edge in the floorplan.  
.P The following command adds a halo around all insts with cells of type myDRAMCell:  addHaloToBlock 10 20 30 40 -cell myDRAMCell -ori MY   If the inst is oriented R0, then the left edge width of the halo is 30 in the floorplan, and the right edge width of the halo is 10.
