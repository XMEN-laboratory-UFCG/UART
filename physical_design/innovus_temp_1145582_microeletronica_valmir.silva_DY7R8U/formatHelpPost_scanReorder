.SH Name \fBscanReorder\fR \-  Reorders the scan cells after running placement
.SH Syntax \fBscanReorder\fR  [-help]  [-addScanPortPrefix <prefix>]  [-clkAware {true|false}]  [-preferH {true|false}]   [-preferV {true|false}]   [-keepPDPorts {true|false} ]   [-scanEffort {low|medium|high|auto} ]   [-skipMode {skipNone|skipBuffer}]
.P Reorders the scan cells after running placement. Controls the skipping and removal of buffers and inverters in the scan chain.
.P Set global parameters for this command with the setScanReorderMode command.
.P This command automatically detects multiple power domains and minimizes the number of scan chains that pass through them. It respects rectilinear and rectangular power domain boundaries. If a scan chain crosses power domains that operate at the same voltage, the software does not insert level shifters. If the scan chain crosses power domains operating at different voltages, the software inserts the appropriate level shifters.
.P If scan reorder fails, use the scanTrace -verbose command to see where the scan chain stops.
.P Note: Parameters set by this command override the settings of the setScanReorderMode command.
.P Note: This command supports multithreading. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-addScanPortPrefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies the prefix to be added to scan hports.  Default: ""  "\fB-clkAware {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether scan reordering is clock tree aware.
.RS  "*" 2 When true, scan reordering is clock tree aware, and is clock tree driven.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When false, scan reordering is not clock tree aware, and is wirelength driven.
.RE   Default: false (The software is not clock tree aware)  This parameter can also have the value 0, 1 or any floating point number between 0 and 1. If this parameter is not specified, or if 0 is specified for this parameter, this indicates: Do not consider clock tree at all. If the value is close to 1, this indicates: Give greater consideration to clock tree.  "\fB-keepPDPorts {true | false}\fR" Maintains or corrects the hierarchical ports without deleting or inserting shifters, and reorders the remaining scan chain.  To turn this option off, use scanReorder -keepPDports false or setScanReorderMode -keepPDPorts false.  Default: true  Note: This parameter works in the MSV flow only.  "\fB-preferH {true | false}\fR" Specifies that the preferred direction for scan reordering connections is horizontal. Reorders the scan chain to snake a sideways "S" configuration if the block is short and wide or the design has vertical routing congestion.  Default: false  Note: If both -preferV and -preferH are set to true, the software does not honor the setting and treats them both as if they were false.  "\fB-preferV {true | false}\fR" Specifies that the preferred direction for scan reordering connections is vertical. Reorders the scan chain to snake a vertical "S" configuration if the block is long and narrow or the design has horizontal routing congestion.  Default: false  Note: If both -preferV and -preferH are set to true, the software does not honor the setting and treats them both as if they were false.  "\fB-scanEffort {low|medium|high|auto}\fR" Specifies the effort level for reordering scan chains.  Default: -medium  Specify one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 auto: Runs internal reorder effort, and it may tune at different stages.  "*" 2 high: Runs more iterations of scan reorder to achieve better net length. Using this parameter increases the run time.  "*" 2 low: Runs fewer iterations of scan reorder to minimize net length quickly.  "*" 2 medium: Runs a normal number of iterations.
.RE   "\fB-skipMode {skipNone | skipBuffer}\fR" Specifies how scan reordering handles buffers and inverters in the scan chain.  Default: skipNone  Specify one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 skipNone: Specifies that buffers and inverters remain after the scan chain reorder.  "*" 2 skipBuffer: Ignores buffers in the scan chain. If a buffer is not connected elsewhere in the design, scanReorder removes the buffer. 
.RE 
.SH Command Order
.P Use this command after running placement with the ignore scan connection parameter (setPlaceMode -place_global_ignore_scan true), and after specifying the scan chain or loading scan chain information in the DEF or TDF files. 
.SH Example
.P The following command reconnects the scan chain so that buffers are skipped:
.P scanReorder -skipMode skipBuffer
