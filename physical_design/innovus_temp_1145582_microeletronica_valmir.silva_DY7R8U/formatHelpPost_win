.SH Name \fBwin\fR \-  Opens the Innovus main window
.SH Syntax \fBwin\fR  [-help]   [on | off] 
.P Opens the Innovus main window. This is usually done after executing the command innovus -init <tclCommandFile>.
.P If you run the win command when the Innovus main window is already open, the tool retains the current zoom level and displays the main window without refreshing it. For example:
.P innovus 23> zoomBox 94 -640 95 -645  innovus 24> win
.P This displays the main window with the design zoomed to the coordinates "94 -640 95 -645". 
.P Note: If you started the Innovus software with the innovus -nowin command, you cannot then use the win command to display the Innovus main window.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each win parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the  man command:  man win  "\fBon | off\fR" Specifies whether to switch on or off the window.  Data_type: string, optional
