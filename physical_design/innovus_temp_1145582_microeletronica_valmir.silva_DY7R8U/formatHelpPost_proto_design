.SH Name \fBproto_design\fR \-  Generates an initial floorplan for prototyping that can be used as a start point for making the final floorplan
.SH Syntax \fBproto_design\fR  [-help]   [-constraints <name>]   [-summary <file>_<name>]  
.P Generates an initial floorplan for prototyping that can be used as a start point for making the final floorplan. It is a super command that places flexModels, power domains, and/or user-specified module seeds. 
.P Note: The proto_design command supports multiple levels of hierarchy, such as nested partitions and nested power domains. To support this feature, you can use the set_proto_mode -proto_design_level multi_level option. You also have a choice to run proto_design to place FlexModels and/or macro blocks for each level of hierarchy for better placement QOR.
.P By default, the proto_design command makes settings internally so that FlexModel floorplans are available even though any user-defined settings are not made. However, if you make any changes, then the proto_design command settings will be overwritten. This feature helps to improve the usability.
.P Note: The proto_design command honors the fence spacing rules. 
.SH  Parameters   "\fB-constraints <name>\fR" Specifies the constraint file name (string). Uses the constraints specified in the constraint file for fence creation and module guide generation. A constraint file is a text file that can contain a list of seeds used when generating fences and module guides, and basic relative, spacing and orientation constraints to follow during macro placement.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each proto_design parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:    man proto_design  "\fB-summary <file>_<name>\fR" Specifies the name of the file in which the summary output report with some checkPoints like violation summary, TU of modules, master/clones shape are written.  Data_type: string, optional 
.SH  Examples
.P The following example invokes proto_design with the specified constraint file proto_user_constraint.txt file with all the default settings:
.P set_proto_design_mode -timing_aware true  proto_design -constraints proto_user_constraint.txt
