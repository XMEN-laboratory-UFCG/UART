.SH Name \fBtiming_generated_clocks_allow_nested_assertions\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_generated_clocks_allow_nested_assertions\fR {true | false}   
.P Default: false
.P Controls clock latency handling for nested generated clocks that are created on the same timing pin as the master clock. 
.P When set to true, the software handles generation of multiple nested generated clocks that are asserted on the same pin, such that the child clock inherits the clock latency value of its parent clock.
.P When set to false, the nested generated clocks asserted on the same pin do not inherit the latency values and are created with 0ns master clock latency. Any full clock timing path reported using these clocks will show the clock path up to the target pin of the generated clock.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
