.P By default, tool gives error and stops if you call restoreDesign more than once in the same Innovus session unless restore_db_stop_at_design_in_memory is set to 0. Using restoreDesign twice in one Innovus session is not recommended as settings from the first database may not be cleaned up properly and can cause problems in the second database.
