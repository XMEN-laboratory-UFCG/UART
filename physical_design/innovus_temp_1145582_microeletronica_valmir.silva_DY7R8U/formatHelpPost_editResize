.P Resizes wires and pins. The editResize command can be used to:
.RS  "*" 2 Change the length of wires.  "*" 2 Change the width of wires.  "*" 2 Enlarge or shrink wires by changing both the length and width of a wire simultaneously.  "*" 2 Change the width of physical pins.
.RE   Note: While changing the wire width to fix EM violations, apply the following setting before invoking the editResize command:setEditMode -unrestricted_regular_wire_width trueBy default, when you are changing the width of a wire, it snaps to the closest non-default route (NDR) available. If you set the -unrestricted_regular_wire_width parameter to true, a wire can be stretched to any width without any restrictions.
.P Typically, the editResize command can be used in two modes: 
.P Mode 1 - Change the size of a wire or pin in only one direction at a time
.P If -direction is specified, the tool changes the size in the specified direction only. In this mode, the editResize command can be used to:
.RS  "*" 2 Change the length of selected regular and special wires by stretching or shrinking them and then snapping them to the closest manufacturing grid point. The editResize command also supports the stretching/shrinking of 45 and 135-degree wires.   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  Note: Use the editSelect command to select the wires.  "*" 2  Change the width of selected wires and update vias connected to the changed wires to maintain the via-to-wire dimension ratio. editResize can be used to change the width of regular as well as special wires:
.RS  "*" 2 For regular wires, if the width value you specified is not defined in the tech LEF, the tool snaps the width of the regular wire to the closest value defined in the default or non-default rule and prints the following message in the log file:  WARNING: The wire width is not defined in default or non default rule, snap wire width to the closest value defined in LEF file  The tool also selects a suitable via cell defined in the tech LEF file. If a suitable via cell is not available, the tool does not drop any via.  When you change the width of a regular wire, the center line is still connected with the neighboring wires after the change:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 For a special wire, you can change the wire width freely by specifying an incremental value. The tool uses viagen to generate a via after the width change of a special wire.
.RE  Note: Use the editSelect command to select the wires.  If you change the width of a wire, and then change it back to the original width, you might see a discrepancy due to rounding.  Note: If you specify a width value that is not an even multiple of the manufacturing grid value, the software displays a warning.  "*" 2 Resize patch wires. Patch wires can be stretched in four directions:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  Change the width of physical pins. While using the editResize command to change the pin width, keep the following points in mind:
.RE
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 If setEditMode -drc_on true has been specified before modifying the pin width, the tool follows the rules from the LEF file while changing pin width.  "*" 2 The pin width, whether vertical or horizontal, should not be less than the minimum width defined in the LEF file.  "*" 2 If you specify a value less than minimum width for a pin, the tool uses the minimum width for that pin.

.P Mode 2 - Change the size of a wire in both the x and y directions simultaneously
.P If -direction is not specified, the tool changes both the width and height of the selected wire at the same time. You can use -corner to specify the start corner from which to stretch or shrink the wire. This mode works for only horizontal or vertical special wires in the no_connection (-no_conn) mode. Use -dx and -dy to specify the distance to stretch the wire in x and y directions, respectively.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editResize parameter. For a detailed description of the command, use the man command:  man editResize  "\fB-corner {low_left low_right up_left up_right}\fR" Specifies the starting corner from which the wire should be stretched.   "\fB-direction {x y diag45 diag135}\fR" Specifies the direction in which the wire or pin is to be stretched or shrunk:
.RS  "*" 2 x - Resizes wires or pins horizontally. For a horizontal wire, specify the direction as x if you want to modify the length of the wire (i.e stretch or shrink the horizontal wire). For a vertical wire, specify the direction as x if you want to modify the width of the wire.   "*" 2 y - Resizes wires or pins vertically. For a horizontal wire, specify the direction as y if you want to modify the width of the wire. For a vertical wire, specify the direction as y if you want to modify the length of the wire  (i.e stretch or shrink the vertical wire).   "*" 2 diag45 - Resizes the selected wires in the 45-degree direction by the specified offset value.  Note: This parameter can be used only for wires.   "*" 2 diag135 - Resizes the selected wires in the 135-degree direction by the specified offset value.  Note: This parameter can be used only for wires. 
.RE   "\fB-dx <float_value>\fR" Specifies the distance to which the wire should be stretched in the x direction.   "\fB-dy <float_value>\fR" Specifies the distance to which the wire should be stretched in the y direction.   "\fB-keep_center_line {0 1 auto}\fR" Controls whether the wire or physical pin is resized with the center line unchanged:
.RS  "*" 2 0 - Resizes the wire or pin from the specified side only. This option works in both the connection and no_connection (-no_conn) modes.   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  This setting cannot be used for changing the width of signal wires.  "*" 2 1 - Resizes the wire or pin from both the low and high sides, even if you are stretching it from only one side. This is done to keep the center line unchanged.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  This option works in both the connection and no_connection (-no_conn) modes for wires. However, a physical pin can keep the center line unchanged during a resize in the no-connection mode only.   "*" 2 auto - When set to auto, the software automatically detects when to keep the center line unchanged.
.RE   Default: auto   "\fB-no_conn\fR" Resizes the wire without auto via/wire creation and DRC checking.  If -no_conn is not specified, the tool will reprocess the via and do basic DRC checking:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Note: Patch wires are resized without auto via/wire creation and DRC checking even if -no_conn is not specified.  "\fB-offset <float_value>\fR" Specifies, in microns, the distance to which the wires or pins should be stretched or shrunk.  "\fB-polygon_edge_end {<x y>}\fR" Specifies the end point for a polygon edge {x y}. This option is used only to resize a polygon.   "\fB-polygon_edge_start {<x y>}\fR" Specifies the start point for a polygon edge {x y}. This option is used only to resize a polygon.   "\fB-side {high low}\fR" Specifies the side from which the wire or pin is to be stretched or shrunk:
.RS  "*" 2 high - Stretches or shrinks wires or pins from the top or the right.  "*" 2 low - Stretches or shrinks the wires or pins from the bottom or the left.
.RE   "\fB-to <float_value>\fR" Specifies, in microns, the new height for selected horizontal wires or the new width for selected vertical wires.

"*" 2 The following command increases the vertical width of the selected physical pin by 3 m each from both top and bottom, keeping the center line unchanged:  editResize -direction y -offset 3 -side high -no_conn -keep_center_line 1  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
