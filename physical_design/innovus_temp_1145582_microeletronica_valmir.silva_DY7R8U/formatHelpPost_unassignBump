.SH Name \fBunassignBump\fR \-  Removes the Verilog signal names from bumps, which removes the connection between bumps and I/O pins
.SH Syntax \fBunassignBump\fR  [-help]   {-allBumps | -byBumpName {<list>} | -byBumpSite {<list>} | -selected} 
.P Removes the Verilog signal names from bumps, which removes the connection between bumps and I/O pins. The original connection will remain in the Verilog and is connected when the bump is reassigned. If the bump is assigned, it will appear in the DEF SPECIALNETS section with the signal (net) name. Use this command after bumps are assigned with the assignBump command or defined in the I/O file with the signal name, but without the -fixed constraint. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each unassignBump parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man unassignBump  "\fB-allBumps\fR" Removes all the connections between bumps and I/O pins and removes the signal assignment of the bumps.  "\fB-byBumpName <list>\fR" Removes only the connections between bumps and I/O pins contained in the bump name list.  "\fB-byBumpSite <list>\fR" Removes only the connections between bumps and I/O pins contained in the site list.  "\fB-selected\fR" Specifies to unassign the bump(s) selected in the design in the GUI.
