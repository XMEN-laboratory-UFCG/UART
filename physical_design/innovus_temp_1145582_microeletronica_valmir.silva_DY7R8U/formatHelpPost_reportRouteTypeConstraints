.SH Name \fBreportRouteTypeConstraints\fR \-  Reports the route type constraints that are being added on nets during the Innovus flow
.SH Syntax \fBreportRouteTypeConstraints\fR  [-help]  [-file <fileName>]  [-svr]  [-svrOnly]  [-threshold value]  [-summary  | -detailed ] [-detailed  [-timing ]] 
.P Reports the route type constraints that are being added on nets during the Innovus flow. It allows you to monitor the number of constraints, the preferred bottom layer used, the adherence of the different constraint type by the router, and the type of non-default rule (NDR) being used. 
.P The command extracts information about the following groups of route type constraints:
.RS  "*" 2 INNOVUS: includes all route types being added by the software and that are using a bottom preferred layer and the default rule.  "*" 2 INNOVUS_NDR: includes all route types being added by the software and that are using an NDR.  setOptMode -opt_pre_route_ndr_aware makes this type of constraint.  "*" 2  INNOVUS_CLK: includes all route types of clock nets that are being added by the software and that are using default rule.  create_route_type without -non_default_rule and ccopt_property route_type make this type of constraint.  "*" 2  INNOVUS_CLK_NDR: include all route types of clock nets that are being added by the software and that are using an NDR.  create_route_type with -non_default_rule and ccopt_property route_type make this type of constraint.  "*" 2 USER: includes all route types being added by the user. This can be done using the setAttribute command.  "*" 2 USER_NDR: includes all route types being added by the user and that are using an NDR. This can be done using the setAttribute command.

.P When via pillar report is enabled, using the -svr/-svrOnly parameters, the command checks via pillar assigned on data/clock nets and on the secondary PG nets. For sample reports, see UseModelScenariosUse Model Scenarios. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportRouteTypeConstraints parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man reportRouteTypeConstraints.  "\fB-detailed\fR" Prints detailed information on each net with a route type constraint such as the wire length, the routing adherence, some timing information, and so on.  Note: The parameters, -detailed and -summary are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-file file<Name>\fR" Specifies the file name in which the results will be written. If this parameter is not specified, the information is written out in the console and the log file.  "\fB-svr\fR" When specified, reports pins with stack via rule constraints.   "\fB-svrOnly\fR" When specified, reports only those pins that have stack via rule constraints.    "\fB-summary\fR" Prints a summary of the layer constraint usage per layer, per NDR, and per constraint type.  Note: The parameters, -detailed and -summary are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-threshold <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum routing adherence for a net to be included in detailed report. This parameter is specified along with the -detailed paramater.  The default value is 80, which means only nets with adherence < 80 % will be included in detailed report.  Note: It is recommended that you do not  use the -threshold parameter along with the -svrOnly parameter because stack via rule has no routing adherence ratio metric.  "\fB-timing\fR" When this parameter is specified, the report will display timing information on the nets such as slack, delay, and incremental delay while generating the detailed information. 
.SH Use Model Scenarios
.P The use model scenarios for reports including via pillar constraints applied on secondary PG pins are provided below.
.P Reporting stack via rule (including stack via rule used on secondary PG pins) and bottom layer constraint:
.P reportRouteTypeConstraints -svr
.P The following information is included in the summary report:
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P Reporting only stack via rule
.P reportRouteTypeConstraints -svrOnly
.P The above command prints information about only stack via rule including the summary of via pillar rule applied on secondary PG pins.
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P When no via pillar are found on 2nd PG pin, the table will be replaced by following line:
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P When the -detailed parameter is specified while reporting via pillar usage, a new table is generated in the report with the list of secondary PG pins with a via pillar constraint. This is shown below.

.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command prints the summary for the route type constraints:   reportRouteTypeConstraints -summary  The report below summarizes the number of route type constraints per layer  for each category.

.RS  "*" 2 The report below summarizes the number of route type constraints per NDR and for each category. The syntax used is categories_NDR name.   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command prints the detailed route type constraints information:  reportRouteTypeConstraints -detailed  The  report  below  summarizes the percentage of respect of the route type constraint (bottom preferred layer) by the current router. For example, in the report below, for the INNOVUS constraints between 90% and 100% respect of the constraint, there are 100.0% of the nets. While INNOVUS_CLK constraints between 90 - 100% respect of the constraint, there are 98.33% of the nets.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  The report below summarizes the percentage of respect of the NDR constraint by the current router. For example, in the report below, for the INNOVUS_NDR constraints between 90% and 100% respect of the constraint, there are 100% of the nets.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  The report below provides information similar to above reports but on a net to net basis.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command prints the detailed route type constraints information with specified threshold routing adherence of 101, which means only nets with adherence < 101 % will be included in detailed report.  reportRouteTypeConstraints -detailed  -threshold 101  A part of the sample report is shown below.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command prints information about the layer assignment, NDR, and stack via rule.   reportRouteTypeConstraints -svr  A part of the sample report is shown below.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command prints information about only stack via rule.   reportRouteTypeConstraints -svrOnly  A part of the sample report is shown below.
