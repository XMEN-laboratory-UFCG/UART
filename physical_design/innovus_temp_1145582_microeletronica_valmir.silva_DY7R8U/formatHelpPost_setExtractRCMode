.P Sets the native RC extraction mode. Use this command before using the extractRC command. You can use the setExtractRCMode command multiple times during an Innovus session to specify additional parameters or change the previously defined values for the extraction mode. You can perform RC extraction during preRoute and postRoute stages, and select an extraction engine based on the expected run time and accuracy level. Each extraction engine supports a specific set of setExtractRCMode command parameters. The following table lists the engine support for each parameter.
.P Note: In previous releases, the setExtractRCMode command accepted incomplete parameter names. Now, only complete parameter names are recognized by the software. If you enter an incomplete parameter name, the software will return an error that the given parameter is not a legal argument. To avoid this error, update your scripts to use the legal (documented) parameter syntax.
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setExtractRCMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setExtractRCMode.  "\fB-assumeMetFill <scalevalue>  \fR" Takes into account the metal fill in the design. For postRoute extraction, only extraction engine with -effortLevel low supports this parameter.  In postRoute extraction with -effortLevel low, <scalevalue> is not required and will be ignored. Detail extraction uses the FILLACTIVESPACING values from LEF to account for metal fill in the design. If the FILLACTIVESPACING values are not specified in the LEF file, the software uses the default value, which is 0.6um.  In preRoute extraction, when calculating the capacitance of a wire segment in layer <N>, this parameter always assumes layer <N-1> and layer <N+1> to be filled. Specify one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 0: Assume no metal fill in layer <N>.
.RE

.RS  "*" 2 When you do not specify this parameter, the software assumes no metal fill in layer <N>. This is equivalent to setting the scalevalue parameter to 0.

.RE
.RS  "*" 2 x: Capacitance value is calculated once with full metal fill and once without metal fill. The user-specified scale value (decimal value between 0 and 1) determines the interpolation point between the two calculated values, for example, 0.5
.RE   Default: 0  "\fB-capFilterMode { relOnly | relAndCoup | relOrCoup }\fR" Specifies the capacitance filtering mode. The filtering modes are conditions which define how to use the -coupling_c_th and -relative_c_th values, or their combination. Based on the filtering mode specified, the software determines the nets in the design, which will have their coupling capacitance lumped to the ground.  Note: TQuantus only supports the relandCoup mode of this parameter. It does not support the relOnly and relOrCoup modes as they are for old nodes only.  Note: The behavior of the -total_c_th filter is independent of the -capFilterMode parameter setting. Nets that have a total capacitance value lower than the value specified with the -total_c_th parameter will have their coupling capacitances grounded regardless of the -capFilterMode setting.  You can use one of the following modes:
.RS  "*" 2 relOnly: Grounds the coupling capacitance of nets based on the threshold value set by the -relative_c_th parameter.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 relAndCoup: Grounds the coupling capacitance of nets only when it is lower than the threshold value specified with the -relative_c_th parameter as well as the -coupling_c_th parameter. In this mode, you enforce maximum restriction on grounding the coupling capacitances.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 relOrCoup: Grounds the coupling capacitance of nets if it is lower than the threshold value specified with one of the -relative_c_th or -coupling_c_th parameters.
.RE   Default: For TQuantus, IQuantus, and Standalone Quantus extraction, the default value is relAndCoup. For postRoute extraction with -effortLevel low, the default value is dependent on the process node specified with the setDesignMode -process command. If the process node is 130nm or below, the default value is relAndCoup and if the process node is above 130nm, the default value is relOnly.  "\fB-cerebrus_license_only {true | false}\fR" This parameter is applicable to the Cerebrus-Quantus flow.  When set to true, only the Cerebrus license will be considered and Innovus will not fall back to use Quantus license when Cerebrus license(s) is/are not available. By default, the option is set to false, which means the regular Quantus license will be considered when Cerebrus license(s) is/are not available.  Default: false  "\fB-compressOptMemRCDB {true | false }\fR" Generates compressed RCDB data.  Default: false  Note: This functionality reduces the disk usage but leads to marginal increase in run time.  "\fB-coupled {true | false}\fR" Separately outputs grounded and coupling capacitance. The -coupled false value is typically used for static timing analysis. Signal Integrity analysis requires the coupled mode.  Default: true (for postRoute extraction)  Note: The TQuantus extraction engine supports this parameter.  "\fB-coupling_c_th <value_in_fF> \fR" Specifies the threshold value that determines when the extractor lumps a net's coupling capacitance to ground. This parameter is applicable only when the -coupled parameter is set to true.  The software decouples the coupling capacitance of nets when the total coupling capacitance between the pair of nets is lower than the threshold specified with this parameter. The actual decoupling also depends on the setting of the -capFilterMode parameter.  Default: 0.2fF. If the setDesignMode -process <process_node> command is used, the software assigns the recommended default value for this parameter based on the process node specified.  Note: See the setDesignMode command for the list of default values that are applied based on the process node setting.  Note: The TQuantus extraction engine supports this parameter.  "\fB-defViaCap {true | false}\fR" Takes into account the via capacitance in the preRoute RC extraction results. Specify a value of true, if you are experiencing correlation issues caused by deviations in clock latency when running preRoute RC extraction.  Default: false  Note: For 20nm and below nodes, the default value of this parameter is set to true.  "\fB-effortLevel { low | medium | high | signoff }\fR" Specifies the postRoute engine variant that you want to use for performing RC extraction.  Default: low  Note: TQuantus (-effortLevel medium) is the default extraction engine in the postRoute flow for 65 nm and below designs. However, TQuantus and IQuantus require a Quantus Techfile. Therefore, Native Detailed (-effortLevel low) engine remains the default engine if no Quantus Techfile has been defined.  This parameter supports the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 low: Invokes the native detailed extraction engine. This is the same as specifying the -engine postRoute setting.  "*" 2 medium: Invokes the TQuantus extraction engine. This engine supports distributed processing. For this effort level, specify the extra command file using the -extraCmdFile parameter.   TQuantus engine is recommended for process nodes < 65nm.  Note: This setting does not require a Quantus license.  "*" 2 high: Invokes the Integrated-Quantus (IQuantus) extraction engine.   IQuantus provides superior accuracy compared to TQuantus. IQuantus is recommended for extraction after ECO. In addition, IQuantus supports distributed processing. For this effort level, specify the extra command file using the -extraCmdFile parameter.  Note: IQuantus requires a Quantus-XL license.  "*" 2 signoff: Invokes the Standalone Quantus extraction engine. This engine choice provides the highest accuracy. The engine has several runModes, thereby, providing maximum flexibility. For this effort level, specify the extra command file using the -qrcCmdFile parameter.
.RE   "\fB-engine { preRoute | postRoute }\fR" Specifies the extraction engine to use.  Default: preRoute
.RS  "*" 2 preRoute: Uses preRoute engine. RC extraction is done by the fast density measurements of the surrounding wires; coupling is not reported.   Use this mode to perform extraction on pre-routed designs after clock tree synthesis.   "*" 2 postRoute: Uses postRoute engine. RC extraction is done by the detailed measurement of the distance to the surrounding wires; coupling is reported. The -effortLevel parameter further specifies which postRoute engine is used for balancing performance versus accuracy needs.
.RE   "\fB-extraCmdFile <fileName> \fR" Specifies the Quantus extra command file for TQuantus/IQuantus extraction. The extra command file supports the following variables:
.RS  "*" 2 log_file -dump_options {true | false}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 extraction_setup -copy_port_to_obs {true|false}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 extraction_setup -remove_net_pin_overlap {true |false}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 metal_fill -type {grounded | floating | virtual}
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 output_setup -compress_temporary_files {true | false}
.RE   Notes: 
.RS  "*" 2 TQuantus only supports advanced virtual metal fill  in metal_fill in the extra command file. It does not support the grounded and floating options.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When the metal_fill type is virtual, provide the absolute paths to the vmf rule file and the metal schema file. For example,  metal_fill \\
.RE   -type                              virtual \\  -enable_advanced_virtual_fill         true \\  -vmf_metal_scheme_file
.../saveTestcase_vmf/missing_vmf_files/abc.vmf_metal_scheme \\  -vmf_rule_file
.../saveTestcase_vmf/missing_vmf_files/abc.vmf_rule
.RS  "*" 2 The -extraCmdFile parameter becomes non-portable if  the vmf rule file and/or schema file have been specified. This means that the two file paths will not be automatically modified or ported. You can modify the file paths, if required. To make the extra command file portable, ensure that the vmf rule file and schema files are available at the locations specified in the extra command file.  "*" 2 The bold text in the above example indicates that these values are used by default when the commands are not explicitly specified in the extra command file. For example, IQuantus extracts the floating metal fills by default when either the -extraCmdFile option is not specified or the metal_fill variable is not specified in the extra command file.  "*" 2 This parameter is only valid if -effortLevel medium or high is specified.  "*" 2 This parameter is not available on the IBM platform.
.RE   "\fB-extractionFillStreamMapFile <fileName>\fR" This parameter is specified only when -pvs_fill parameter is set to true. When the -pvs_fill parameter is set to true, a Quantus stream/oasis map Tcl command is required to map the PVS layer/dtype data to the corresponding Quantus layers.  If the pvs_fill.data is generated based on stream (GDS), the map file should be in the following format:  #layer gds_layer gds_dtype  <<layer_name>> <<layer_number>> <<data_type>> 
...  If the pvs_fill.data is generated based on OASIS, the map file should be in the following format:  #layer oasis_layer oasis_dtype  <<layer_name>> <<layer_number>> <<data_type>> 
...  Where,
.RS  "*" 2 layer_name is the layer name in the design  "*" 2 layer_number is the layer ID in the GDS/OASIS file  "*" 2 data_type is the datatype specified in the GDS/OASIS file
.RE   For example,  M1  31  0  M1  31  1  M2  32  0  M2  32  1  Note: This parameter only affects signoff Quantus extraction.  Default: " "  "\fB-hardBlockObs {true | false}\fR" Makes cell geometries on metal layers from obstruction, and power and ground pin shapes visible to the extractor for hard blocks only. The software recognizes the following three types of hard blocks:
.RS  "*" 2 Hard macro (CLASS BLOCK in LEF file)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Blackbox (CLASS BLACKBOX in LEF file)
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Partition (Committed during the Innovus session)
.RE   Specify a value of true when routing goes over the listed hard blocks. A value of true removes the optimism for such routes, and provides better correlation with sign-off extraction without significantly impacting runtime.  Note: This parameter is not supported when the extraction engine is TQuantus.  Default: false  "\fB-incremental {true | false} \fR" Uses incremental IQuantus extraction mode.  If the incremental mode is set after performing initial extraction on full design, extraction checks for design changes, and if the amount of changes are below threshold, extraction is rerun in incremental mode on the modified areas only.  Incremental mode can provide significant performance improvement during signal integrity optimization phase.  Default: true  "\fB-layerIndependent {0 | 1}\fR" By default, this parameter is set to 1. In this mode, layer-independent extraction is enabled. This mode of extraction is recommended for designs with layer stacks that have significant variations in RC characteristics. This mode uses advanced techniques to avoid timing jumps due to differences in routing-layer assignments between preRoute and postRoute stages.  When set to 0, layer-independent extraction is disabled.  Note: PreRoute extraction scale-factors should be computed without setting this mode.  Default: 1  "\fB-lefTechFileMap <fileName> \fR" Specifies the location of the optional layer map file for the IQuantus and Standalone Quantus engines.  Note: For IQuantus, layer mapping between the LEF or DEF file and the Quantus technology file is done automatically. This parameter is only necessary if this mechanism fails. If necessary, you can use a copy of the automatically generated layer map file extLogDir/IQRC_*/<design>.layermap.log and modify it for your own use.  Layer map file is required for use with Standalone Quantus.  For TSV designs, you are required to provide the name of the layer map file for IQuantus and Standalone Quantus.  Note: If used, the layer map file must be in the Common Command Language (CCL) format.  The following is an example of the layer map file format:  extraction_setup \\  -technology_layer_map \\  # <LEF/DEF Name> #<Tech File Name>  M1 METAL_1 \\  VIA1 VIA_1 \\  M2 METAL_2 \\  Note: For cell-level IQuantus layer map, the DEF/LEF layer names are case sensitive, but ICT layer names are case-insensitive.  Note: TQuantus is not impacted by this parameter because it always automatically generates the layer map.  "\fB-localCpu <number_of_cpus>\fR" Specifies the number of CPUs to be used for IQuantus extraction.   Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This option is only applicable for IQuantus extraction engine.  "*" 2 When specified, it overrides the setMultiCpuUsage -localCpu option for IQuantus.
.RE   Default: As specified in the setMultiCpuUsage -localCpu setting.  "\fB-pvs_fill\fR" When set to true, the PVS fill data attached to the Innovus database is sent to Quantus so that the effects of the fill data are extracted. This parameter only affects signoff Quantus extraction. It has no effect on tQuantus or iQuantus extraction done inside Innovus. This parameter requires that either the -extractionFillStreamMapFile parameter or the -signoff_stream_layer_map parameter is specified.  Default: false  "\fB-qrcCmdFile <fileName> \fR" Specifies the user created Quantus command file to be used for running Standalone Quantus. This command file should be in the new CCL syntax.  Note: This parameter is only valid if -effortLevel signoff and -qrcCmdType partial or custom is selected.  "\fB-qrcCmdType {auto | partial | custom}\fR" Specifies whether to derive the settings for running Quantus from the Innovus settings, or from user-created command file using the -qrcCmdFile parameter. The -qrcCmdType parameter is only valid if -effortLevel signoff is selected. This parameter supports the following values:
.RS  "*" 2  auto: Derives the Quantus settings automatically from the Innovus parameter settings.  Note: In this mode, the -lefTechFileMap parameter is required to be specified.  "*" 2 partial: Appends user commands from the qrcCmdFile to the settings derived from the Innovus parameter settings. You must provide the partial mode command file in CCL syntax. Use the partial command file only when you add extraction directives for those options that cannot be set in Innovus.  Following are some important restrictions:
.RS  "*" 2 Do not specify the following options in the partial mode command file:
.RE

.RS  "*" 2 Do not specify the "-directory_name" and "-temporary_directory_name" in the output_setup section of the command file
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Do not specify output file using output_setup -file_name command in the partial command file
.RE  Note: The multi-temperature multi-corner extraction (MTMC) feature is enabled in the partial mode only if process technology is not specified in the user command file. In MTMC extraction, for RC corners with same Quantus technology file but different temperatures, resistance is extracted for multiple corners while capacitance is extracted only for a single corner.  Note: There is no checking for syntax or content of this file. This file is appended as is to the automatically created Quantus command file.  "*" 2 custom: Gets the complete Quantus settings from the user-created command file. Except for input and output, no settings from Innovus parameters are used. You must provide the complete Quantus command file in CCL syntax. Following are some important restrictions for using custom command file: 
.RS  "*" 2 Do not specify an input DEF/OA DB in the custom mode command file
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Do not specify the "-directory_name" and "-temporary_directory_name" and "-file_name" in the output_setup section of the command file.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Specify the output SPEF file with the following convention for the name:<design.spef>.  In the MMMC mode, the output SPEF files will be named: <design>_<corner>_<Temperature>.spef.   Here "design" refers to the top cell name.  Note: Do not prefix or postfix the output file name.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Specify the Quantus Techfile(s) to be used. In the MMMC mode, the corner names should match the names used in the create_rc_corner command
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Provide Quantus Techfile layermapping information in the custom command file
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If GDS is provided for cell contents, provide a Quantus Techfile to GDS layer number matching
.RE  Note: The MTMC extraction feature is not enabled in the custom mode of Quantus extraction.  Note: There is no checking for syntax or content of this command file prior to running the extraction. The command file will be used as is. If the output file is not specified correctly, the resulting parasitic file will not be read into the Innovus RC database.
.RE   "\fB-qrcOutputMode {rcdb | spef} \fR" Sets the Quantus output write mode to RCDB or SPEF.  Note: This parameter is only valid if -effortLevel is signoff.  Default: spef  "\fB-qrcRunMode {concurrent | sequential}\fR" Specifies the Quantus run mode in MMMC designs.  Default: concurrent  Note: For MMMC designs, in Quantus partial command type, do not specify the output SPEF file name and RC corner name in the command file to run Quantus in concurrent or sequential mode.   For MMMC designs, in Quantus custom command type, do not specify the output SPEF file name and RC corner name together in the command file. Quantus sequential mode is not supported in custom command type.  This parameter supports the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 Concurrent: Runs Quantus for all active corners concurrently.  "*" 2 Sequential: Runs Quantus for all active corners sequentially.
.RE   "\fB-relative_c_th <value> \fR" Sets a ratio threshold value that determines when the extractor lumps a net's coupling capacitance to ground. This parameter is applicable only when the -coupled parameter is set to true.  If the total coupling capacitance between a pair of nets is less than the percentage (specified with this parameter) of the total capacitance of the net with the smaller total capacitance in the pair, the coupling capacitance between these two nets will be considered for grounding. The actual decoupling also depends on the setting of the -capFilterMode parameter.  Default: 1.  The range of this value is 0 to 1. If the setDesignMode -process <process_node> command is used, the software assigns the recommended default value for this parameter based on the process node specified.  Note: See the setDesignMode command for the list of default values that are applied based on the process node settings.  Note: The tQuantus extraction engine supports this parameter.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets the extraction status of the loaded design and the setExtractRCMode parameters to their default values.  The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setExtractRCMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset , the software resets only those parameters to their default values. Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.   "\fB-signoff_stream_layer_map <fileName>  \fR" This parameter is specified only when the -pvs_fill parameter is set to true. When the -pvs_fill parameter is set to true, a Quantus stream/oasis map Tcl command is required to map the PVS layer/dtype data to the corresponding Quantus layers.  If the pvs_fill.data is generated based on stream (GDS/OASIS), the map file should be in the following format:  #layer gds_layer gds_dtype use-type color-ID  <<layer_name>> <<layer_number>> <<data_type>> <<use-type>> <<color-ID>> 
...  Where,
.RS  "*" 2 layer_name is the LEF layer name in the design  "*" 2 layer_number is the layer ID in the GDS/OASIS file  "*" 2 data_type is the datatype of the layer in the GDS/OASIS file  "*" 2 use_type is the keyword for identifying the use of the data. The valid values are:
.RE
.RS  "*" 2
.RS  "*" 2 gray: library data in the GDS/OASIS file  "*" 2 fill: regular metal fill data in the GDS/OASIS file  "*" 2 active: active metal fill data in the GDS/OASIS file
.RE  "*" 2 color-ID is the color ID. Use 1 or 2 if the layer is colored, or use hyphen - if the layer is not colored
.RE   For example,  M1  31  0 gray -  M1  31  1 fill -  M2  32  0 gray -  M2  32  1 fill -  Note: This parameter only affects signoff Quantus extraction.  Default: ""  "\fB-total_c_th <value_in_fF>\fR" Specifies the threshold value (femtoFarads) that determines when the extractor lumps a net's coupling capacitance to ground. This parameter is applicable only when the -coupled parameter is set to true.  The software grounds the coupling capacitances for the nets which have a total capacitance value less than the value specified with this parameter.  Default: 0 fF. If the setDesignMode -process <process_node> command is used, the software assigns the recommended default value for this parameter based on the process node specified.  Note: See the setDesignMode command for the list of default values that are applied based on the process node settings.  Note: The TQuantus extraction engine supports this parameter.  "\fB-tQuantusModelFile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the tQuantus model file to be used for postRoute effort-level medium extraction.  You can specify the model file as follows:  setExtractRCMode -engine postRoute -effortLevel medium -tQuantusModelFile tQuantus_model.bin  For details of the use model, see Creating RC Model Data in TQuantus Model File in the Innovus User Guide.  Default: ""  Note: If this file is not specified, it will be generated automatically by the software.  "\fB-tsvSubcktFile <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the Through Silicon Via (TSV) subckt file to be used. The file contains the
.subckt model information for TSV. The file has a Spice format. A sample file is shown below. 
.subckt TSV top bottom  R1 top n2 0.03075  R2 n2 bottom 0.03075  C1 n2 0 28f 
.ends  Where,  top and bottom refer to the terminal nodes on the top and bottom layers of the TSV  n2 is the internal node between the top and bottom layers  R1 top n2 0.03075 means that a resistor with a resistance of 0.03075 Ohms is added between the top and n2 nodes  R2 n2 bottom 0.03075 means that a resistor with a resistance of 0.03075 Ohms is added between the bottom and n2 nodes  C1 n2 0 28f means that a ground capacitance of 28 fF is added on the n2 node  Note: The IQuantus engine might not keep the subckt connectivity as it is. The optimization of RES network will remove node n2 (if there is no other connections) and keep a single resistor between the top and bottom nodes with an accumulated resistance. For example, in the above example, the accumulated resistance will be 0.0615 Ohms. Capacitance will also be moved to a higher layered node. In the above example, this layer is top.  Default: "" (empty string)  "\fB-turboReduce {true|false|auto}\fR" Controls the turbo reduction feature for tQuantus/IQuantus, and Standalone Quantus extraction. It has no effect on tQuantus.  This is a cell-level reduction that provides a complimentary reduction capability and only affects the coupling capacitors. It has no effect on lumped capacitor extraction.  Default: auto  When set to auto, the software automatically turns on turbo reduction and proceeds when the required Quantus license is available. However, if the required Quantus license is not installed in the license server, the software automatically turns off Turbo reduction and proceeds with a warning message. If the license is installed in the license server but temporarily not available, then two scenarios are possible. First, if the license wait mode is not turned on, then Quantus will look for the license right away and error out because the license is not available. Second, if the license wait mode is turned on, then IQuantus will wait and check for the license periodically until timeout. If the license is available before the timeout, turbo reduction will be performed but if the license is not available before timeout, IQuantus will error out.  When set to true, the turbo reduction engine is on. However, if the required Quantus license is not installed in the license server, then Standalone Quantus and IQuantus will error out with a message and the run will stop. It is because setting the option to true means the user really wants to perform turbo reduction.  When set to false, the turbo reduction engine is switched off.  For details, see the table titled, Behavior of Turbo Reduction, below. However, note that the licensing rules given in this table are not applicable to tQuantus because tQuantus does not require any Quantus license.  "\fB-useQrcOAInterface {true | false}\fR" When set to true, specifies that OpenAccess (OA) interface be used for invoking Quantus extraction instead of using the DEF-based flow.  Default: false  "\fB-useShieldingInDetailMode {true | false}\fR" Assumes shielding for any wire segment of a clock net that does not have any shielding yet, and the space between the wire segment and its neighbor is greater than or equal to the following:2s+w  where,   <s> = minimum spacing or non-default spacing   <w> = minimum width or non-default width   This parameter is available in postRoute -effortLevel low mode only.  Default: false  "\fB-viaCap {true | false} \fR" Extracts capacitance values considering part of the via geometries that do not overlap with the wire geometries. Via geometries that do not overlap the wire geometries are often found if you are designing using newer design technologies such as 90nm or when using multiple cut via.  This parameter is only available in postRoute -effortLevel low mode.  Default: true
