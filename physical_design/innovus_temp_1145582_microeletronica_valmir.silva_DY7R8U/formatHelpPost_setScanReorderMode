.P Controls certain aspects of how the software reorders scan chains.
.P Use the getScanReorderMode command to return the current settings for the setScanReorderMode command.
.P Note: Parameters specified by the scanReorder command supersede those specified by the setScanReorderMode command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-addScanPortPrefix <prefix>\fR" Specifies the prefix to be added to scan hports.  Default: ""  "\fB-clkAware {true | false}\fR" Specifies whether scan reordering is clock tree aware.
.RS  "*" 2 When true, scan reordering is clock tree aware, and is clock tree driven.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 When false, scan reordering is not clock tree aware, and is wirelength driven.
.RE   Default: false (The software is not clock tree aware.)  "\fB-compLogic {true | false}\fR" If set to true, enables -scanTrace trace through multiple input logic gates (whose input/output pin is not defined in the input scan DEF) in the scan path.  Default: false  Note: When -compLogic is set to true, there can be multiple valid scan paths. In that case, scanTrace will select one of the valid paths. However, it is recommended that you specify the relevant gate's input/output pin to avoid trace through alternative paths.  "\fB-enable_for_partition {true|false}\fR" Enables scanReorder for a design with partition.  This option works with the -keepPort option.  Default: false  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setScanReorderMode parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setScanReorderMode.  "\fB-keepPDPorts {true | false}\fR" Maintains or corrects the hierarchical ports without deleting or inserting shifters, and reorders the remaining scan chain.  Default: true  Note: This parameter works in the MSV flow only.  "\fB-keepPort <fileName>\fR" Specifies a file that lists the names of hierarchical instances whose ports cannot be changed, removed, duplicated, or reordered during scan reordering.  Default: ""  "\fB-preferH {true | false}\fR" Specifies that the preferred direction for scan reordering connections is horizontal. Reorders the scan chain to snake a sideways "S" configuration if the block is short and wide or the design has vertical routing congestion.  Default: false  Note: If both -preferV and -preferH are set to true, the software does not honor the setting and treats them both as if they were false.  "\fB-preferV {true | false}\fR" Specifies that the preferred direction for scan reordering connections is vertical. Reorders the scan chain to snake a vertical "S" configuration if the block is long and narrow or the design has horizontal routing congestion.  Default: false  Note: If both -preferV and -preferH are set to true, the software does not honor the setting and treats them both as if they were false.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets parameters to their default values. The -reset parameter must be the first parameter specified. If you specify -reset by itself, the software resets all setScanReorderMode parameters to their default values. If you specify parameters after -reset, the software resets only those parameters to their default values.  Any values that do not already match the default value and are reset will be reported.  "\fB-scanEffort {low | medium | high | auto}\fR" Specifies the effort level for reordering scan chains.  Default: auto  Specify one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 auto: Runs internal reorder effort, and it may tune at different stages.  "*" 2 high: Runs more iterations of scan reorder to achieve better net length. Using this parameter increases the run time.  "*" 2 low: Runs fewer iterations of scan reorder to minimize net length quickly.  "*" 2 medium: Runs a normal number of iterations.
.RE   "\fB-skipMode {skipNone | skipBuffer | skipFloatingBuffer}\fR" Specifies how scan reordering handles buffers and inverters in the scan chain.  Default: skipNone  Specify one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 skipNone: Specifies that buffers and inverters remain after the scan chain reorder.  "*" 2 skipBuffer: Ignores buffers in the scan chain. If a buffer is not connected elsewhere in the design, scanReorder removes the buffer.  "*" 2 skipFloatingBuffer: Skips only buffers in the floating section and keeps the buffers that belong to an ordered section.
.RE    Note: During scan reordering, the order of scan elements in the ordered section must be kept as importing scan specification. However, the order of the floating elements can be changed.  "\fB-swapEffort {low|medium|high}     \fR" Specifies the effort level for scanReorder different chains swapping.  Default: high  Specify one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 high  "*" 2 low  "*" 2 medium
