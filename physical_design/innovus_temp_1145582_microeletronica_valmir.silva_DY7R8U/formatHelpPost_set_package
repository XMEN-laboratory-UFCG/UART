.SH Name \fBset_package\fR \-  Specifies the package model information to be used in power rail analysis
.SH Syntax  \fBset_package\fR  [-help]   -reset | {-spice <model_file>  [-mapping <mapping_file>]  [-offset {x y}]  [-die_instance_name <dieinstname>]  [-rotate <rotation_angle_in_degrees>]  [-flip {true | false}]  [-subckt <subcircuitname>]  [-scale <scaling_factor_number>]  [-mapping_type { distributed | lumped }]  } 
.P Specifies the package model information to be used in power rail analysis. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-die_instance_name <dieinstname>\fR" Specifies the die instance name for multi-die analysis. This option is only available in multi-die analysis (set_rail_analysis_mode -die_mode multi-die).  "\fB-flip {true | false}\fR" Specifies to flip the die along the Y axis.  Default: false  "\fB-help \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each set_package parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man set_package.  "\fB-mapping<mapping_file>\fR" Specifies the name of the package terminal mapping file, which contains the mapping of the terminals of the SPICE subcircuit in the package model file (Specified by the -spice <model_file> parameter) to the locations at the grid or top-level pins.  The mapping file formats supported by the software are:
.RS  "*" 2 Model Connection Protocol (MCP)  "*" 2 Voltus-specific Format
.RE   For more information on the mapping file formats, refer to the Package Model and Mapping File section in the "File Formats" chapter of Voltus User Guide.  "\fB-mapping_type { distributed | lumped }\fR" Specifies the type of mapping to be used in the Voltus-specific terminal mapping file that will be added in the rail analysis flow. The possible arguments are:
.RS  "*" 2 distributed - A distributed mapping file lists out the mapping for each bump on the die to its corresponding package port. The mapping file is specified with the set_package -mapping parameter.  "*" 2 lumped - A lumped mapping file allows for auto-grouping of the die bumps to the lumped package ports. When lumped is specified, the software implements a lumped package by internally creating a lumped package model and its mapping file.    The format of the lumped mapping file is:  <terminal_name>   <die | vsrc>    <net_name>     vddcore_in        die           vddcore     vddcore_out       vsrc          vddmpu  In this format: 
.RS  "*" 2 the software connects <terminal_name> die <net_name> to the bumps belonging to <net_name> on the die  "*" 2 the software connects <terminal_name> vsrc <net_name> to the voltage source of <net_name>  "*" 2 The number of lines in the lumped mapping file are few and are equal to the number of terminals on the package model
.RE 
.RE   Default: distributed  "\fB-offset {x y}\fR" Specifies to adjust and shift the X Y coordinates in the MCP header for each pin.  When performing package analysis, the MCP is used to map the terminals of the SPICE subcircuit in the package model file to the locations at the grid or top-level pins in DEF. The die origin specified in MCP must be same as specified in DEF. If the die origin is not the same, you can use the -offset parameter to modify the XY location specified in the MCP file.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all the previous set_package command settings to the default settings.  "\fB-rotate <rotation_angle_in_degrees>\fR" Specifies the rotation angle of the die. The possible values are: 0/45/90/135/180/225/270/315. Rotation is always in the counter clockwise direction from the original point. Default value is 0.  This information is required to do coordinate conversion for xy based pin mapping.  "\fB-scale <scaling_factor_number>\fR" Specifies to scale the package model.   "\fB-spice<model_file>\fR" Specifies a file containing a SPICE subcircuit describing the package model.  "\fB-subckt <subcircuitname>\fR" Defines the top level subcircuit in package files.
