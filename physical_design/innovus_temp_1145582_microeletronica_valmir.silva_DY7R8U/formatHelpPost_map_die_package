.SH Name \fBmap_die_package\fR \-  The command launches the MCP Editor GUI to make manual connections between package and die pins
.SH Syntax  \fBmap_die_package\fR  [-help]  [-output <directory>]  -package_model_file <filename>  {-die_mcp_header <filename> | -net_pad_file_pair {{<<net1>> <<pad file1>>} {<<net2>> <<pad file2>>}...}} 
.P The command launches the MCP Editor GUI to make manual connections between package and die pins. It also performs the following functions:
.RS  "*" 2 maps the voltage source files with the package model to check and correct mapping information before rail analysis.  "*" 2 generates a mapping file that can be used in previous versions of the software in case there is no mapping between die and package pins.
.RE
.P The command has two types of inputs:
.RS  "*" 2 Voltage source files in the xy format and a package model file with the MCP header.  "*" 2 A circuit file with the MCP header and a package model file with the MCP header.
.RE
.P The output will be the same for both types of inputs:
.RS  "*" 2 A ckt mapping file containing only the MCP header, with the name pkg_model_base_name + _map+suffix.  "*" 2 The file named 'un_mapped_bumps.txt' will contain all the bumps which cannot be mapped. 
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.   "\fB-die_mcp_header <filename>\fR" Specifies a circuit file with the MCP header containing the die abstract.  "\fB-net_pad_file_pair {{<<net1>> <<pad file1>>} {<<net2>> <<pad file2>>}...}\fR" Specifies the voltage source files mapping to each net.  "\fB-output <directory>\fR" Specifies the output directory containing the mapping results.  "\fB-package_model_file<filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the package model file. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command specifies a circuit file with MCP header and a package model file with the MCP header:  map_die_package -die_mcp_header super_filter_mcp_ploc.ckt -package_model_file C1_Voltus_4L_C1_Voltus_4L_Final_PinBaseSPICE.ckt -output out_ploc  "*" 2  The following command specifies voltage source files in the XY format and a package model file with the MCP header:  map_die_package -output
./out_pad -net_pad_file_pair {{VDD VDD_AO_srcs.pp} {VDD VDD_external_srcs.pp} {VSS VSS_srcs.pp}} -package_model_file C1_Voltus_4L_C1_Voltus_4L_Final_PinBaseSPICE.ckt
