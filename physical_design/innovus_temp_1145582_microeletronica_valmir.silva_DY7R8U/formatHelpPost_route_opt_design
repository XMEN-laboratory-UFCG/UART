.SH Name \fBroute_opt_design\fR \-  Combines the routing and post-route optimization flows into a single flow
.SH Syntax \fBroute_opt_design\fR  [-help]  [-drv]  [-hold]  [-ideal_clock]  [-num_paths <number_of_paths>]  [-opt]  [-out_dir <directory_name>]  [-prefix <file_name_prefix>]  [-route]  [-setup]   [-timing_debug_report]
.P Combines the routing and post-route optimization flows into a single flow. The benefit of this approach is to interleave the optimization step with routing step. When this command is run, the software performs global and detail routing, setup/hold timing optimization, and DRV fixing. The route_opt_design command can be used instead of using two separate commands listed below:
.RS  "*" 2 routeDesign  "*" 2 optDesign -postRoute -setup -hold
.RE
.P Note: The route_opt_design flow is different from routeDesign followed by optDesign -postRoute -setup -hold in that the route_opt_design command performs more optimization during the routing stage.
.P The route_opt_design command has parameters to split the routing part (-route) and the optimization part (-opt). When these parameters are specified, the flow exits the interleaved mode, and goes back to the traditional flow with separate commands. This means that route_opt_design -route is equivalent to routeDesign, and route_opt_design -opt is equivalent to optDesign -postRoute -setup -hold.
.P By default, the optimization step of route_opt_design fixes both setup and hold timing in the interleaved mode with routing. To fix setup timing only, use route_opt_design -setup. When the -setup parameter is specified, the software performs setup timing optimization, and skips hold timing fixing.
.P Any partial optimization, using the -drv or -hold parameters cannot be worked in the interleaved mode. Therefore, if any of these parameters are specified, the software redirects to the optDesign -postRoute command with the specified option. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each route_opt_design parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man route_opt_design.  "\fB-drv\fR" Fixes the max_cap and max_tran violations by using the postRoute optimization flow. This is equivalent to optDesign -postRoute -drv.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 Ensure that the design is routed before using this parameter.  "*" 2 The -drv parameter can only be used with the -opt parameter.
.RE   "\fB-hold\fR" When this parameter is specified without -setup, the software exits the interleaved mode, and fixes hold timing violations with the postRoute optimization flow. This is equivalent to optDesign -postRoute -hold.  Note: Ensure that the design is routed before using this parameter.  When this parameter is specified along with the -setup parameter, either -hold -setup or -setup -hold, both the setup and hold timing violations are fixed in the interleaved mode. This is the default behavior of route_opt_design.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 The design should be in the post CCOpt stage to use route_opt_design.  "*" 2 The -hold and -drv parameters are mutually exclusive.  "*" 2 The -hold parameter can only be used with the -opt parameter.
.RE   "\fB-ideal_clock\fR" Performs timing optimization using ideal clocks instead of propagated clocks. Using ideal clocks enables you to optimize timing without building a clock tree first, or ignore the existing clock tree, to close ideal timing. If this parameter is not specified, the software assumes the clock tree has been built, and optimizes timing based on propagated clocks.   "\fB-num_paths <number_of_paths>\fR" Specifies the number of timing paths generated in the timing report. By default, all timing paths are reported.   "\fB-out_dir <directoryName>\fR" Specifies the directory where the software writes timing reports generated when this command runs.  Default: timingReports  "\fB-opt\fR" When specified, uses the optDesign -postRoute -setup -hold command and fixes both setup and hold violations for the postRoute optimization flow. The software exits the interleaved mode, and skips routing.  Note: Ensure that the design is routed before using this parameter.   By default, both setup and hold timing violations are fixed. To limit the scope of the optimization, use the -setup, -hold, and -drv parameters along with -opt parameter.   Note: The parameters -route and -opt are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-prefix <fileNamePrefix>\fR" Specifies a prefix for route_opt_design report file names.  Default: <DesignName_DesignStage>, where <DesignStage> is postCTS, or postRoute for route_opt_design.  "\fB-route\fR" Specifies that only routing should be done. This is equivalent to routeDesign without performing track optimization in the interleaved mode.  Note: The design should be in the post CCOpt stage.  Note: The -route parameter and the following parameters are mutually exclusive; -opt, -setup, -hold, and -drv.  "\fB-setup\fR" Corrects setup violations in the interleaved mode. When specified without the -hold parameter, the software skips the fixing of hold timing violations.  Note: The design should be in the post CCOpt stage.  Note: The -setup and -drv parameters are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-timing_debug_report\fR" When specified, generates a machine-readable timing debug report after completing routing and postRoute optimization. This report is used for debugging timing results using the timing debug feature in Innovus.  Note: You can specify the number of paths to be reported using the -num_paths parameter. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Use the following command to enable interleaved track optimization during the routing stage, for fixing setup violations only:  route_opt_design -setup  "*" 2 Use the following command to enable interleaved track optimization during the routing stage, for fixing both setup and hold violations:  route_opt_design or  route_opt_design -setup -hold  "*" 2 Use the following command to exit interleaved track optimization mode and perform routing only:  route_opt_design -route  "*" 2 Use the following command to exit interleaved track optimization mode and perform postRoute optimization only for fixing setup timing:  route_opt_design -opt -setup  This is equivalent to optDesign -postRoute or optDesign -postRoute -setup  "*" 2 Use the following command to exit interleaved track optimization mode and perform postRoute optimization for fixing both setup and hold timing:  route_opt_design -opt  This is equivalent to optDesign -postRoute -setup -hold
