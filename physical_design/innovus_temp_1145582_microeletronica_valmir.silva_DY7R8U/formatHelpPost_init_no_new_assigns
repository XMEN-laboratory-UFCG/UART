.P Turns on an assign-free flow. By default, applications like optimization can add Verilog assigns to remove unnecessary buffers and reduce power. If you have external tools that do not support Verilog assigns, you can set this value to true to prevent applications from adding any new assign statements to the Verilog netlist. If there are existing assigns in the Verilog netlist you can remove them with the remove_assigns command.
