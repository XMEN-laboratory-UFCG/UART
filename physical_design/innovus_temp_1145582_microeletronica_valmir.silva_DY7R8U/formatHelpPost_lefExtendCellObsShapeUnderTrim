.P Type: String
.P Default: ""
.P Specifies a list of routing layers. On each specified layer the LEF OBS shapes that are overlapped partially by a shape on the TRIMMETAL layer (that trims the routing layer), will be extended in the preferred routing direction to be fully covered by the trim shape. You can use this global for some advanced node libraries to avoid trim/OBS short violations.
