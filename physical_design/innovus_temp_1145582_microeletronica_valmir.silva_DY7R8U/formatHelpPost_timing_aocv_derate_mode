.TH timing_aocv_derate_mode  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_aocv_derate_mode\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBtiming_aocv_derate_mode\fR  {aocv_multiplicative | aocv_additive} 
.P Default: aocv_multiplicative
.P Controls the AOCV derating mode.
.P When set to aocv_multiplicative, the derating factor will be calculated as AOCV derating * OCV derating, which is set using the set_timing_derate command.
.P When set to aocv_additive, the derating factor will be calculated as AOCV derating + OCV derating values.
.P When you use this global variable, the report_timing command shows the total_derate column in the timing report output, which allows you to view and cross-check the calculated total derate factor.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
