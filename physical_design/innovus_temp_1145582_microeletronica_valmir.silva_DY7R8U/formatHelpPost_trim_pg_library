.SH Name \fBtrim_pg_library\fR \-  Specifies to remove a list of cells from the specified PGV
.SH Syntax  \fBtrim_pg_library\fR   [-help]  [-delete_cells <cell1> <cell2>
...]  [-delete_cells_file <file_name>]  -library_list_file <file_name>  [-output <directory> <_name>]  -output_library <library> <_name> 
.P Specifies to remove a list of cells from the specified PGV. This command allows you to trim the size of a cell library by removing unwanted cells, which can reduce the overall time required for extraction.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage.   "\fB-delete_cells <cell1> <cell2>
...\fR" Default: None  Specifies the name of a cell or a list of cells to be removed from the power-grid library.  "\fB-delete_cells_file <file_name>\fR" Default: None  Specifies the name of a file containing the list of cells (one per line) to be removed from the power-grid library.  File Format:  cell1  cell2  cell3  "\fB-library_list_file <file_name>\fR" Default: None  (Mandatory) Specifies the name of a file containing the library or libraries (one per line) that are to be trimmed. If multiple libraries are given, Library Generation merges the multiple same-type power-grid libraries into one consolidated power-grid library.  File Format:  PGV1  PGV2  PGV3  "\fB-output <directory> <_name>\fR" Default: current working directory  Specifies the name of the output directory in which the trimmed power-grid library will be created.  "\fB-output_library <library> <_name>\fR" Default: None  (Mandatory) Specifies the name of the trimmed power-grid library created after removing the specified cells. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command removes the cell AND2X2 from the power-grid libraries specified in the library_list.txt file and generates one consolidated power-grid library trimlibrary:  trim_pg_library -library_list_file library_list.txt -output_library trimlibrary -delete_cells AND2X2
