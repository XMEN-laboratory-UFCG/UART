.SH Name \fBget_lib_pg_pins\fR \-  Returns a collection of library-level PG pins from the loaded libraries
.SH Syntax \fBget_lib_pg_pins\fR   [-help]  [-filter <expr>]  {-of_objects <object_list>}
.P Returns a collection of library-level PG pins from the loaded libraries.  An empty collection is returned if no PG pin definitions are found in the loaded library. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.  "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression.  For any library pg pins that match the specified expression, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the library pg pin.  You can filter library pg pins along with the -of_objects parameter - using the library pg pin properties of lib_pg_pin object type (supported through the get_property command).  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all library PG pins associated with the specified library cells.  The -of_objects parameter supports get_lib_cells as valid objects.  For example,  get_lib_pg_pins -of_objects [get_lib_cells sc9_cmos32lp/DFFQ_X1M] VDD VSS  get_lib_pg_pins *  **ERROR: (TCLCMD-1420): Currently only -of_objects option is supported 
.SH   Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command gets the collection of all the library-level pg pins of the specified library cell:  get_lib_pg_pins -of_objects [get_lib_cells sc_cmoslp/AO22X]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command filters the collection of all library-level pg pins of the library cell to return only the library pg pins containing the string name defined with the lib_pg_pin name attribute:  get_lib_pg_pins -of_objects [get_lib_cells sc_cmoslp/AO22X] -filter "name =~ *VDD*"
