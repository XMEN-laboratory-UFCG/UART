.TH timing_case_analysis_for_sequential_propagation  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_case_analysis_for_sequential_propagation\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_case_analysis_for_sequential_propagation\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Calculates constants on the outputs of sequential elements. When you change setting of this global variable, each time a complete timing update is required and incremental updates are abandoned. If the outputs evaluate to a constant, the check arcs and delay arcs are disabled regardless of the setting.
.P When this global is set to true (or the setAnalysisMode -sequentialConstProp parameter is specified), you can set timing_case_analysis_for_icg_propagation global variable to require_seq_prop to allow propagation of constants through ICG cells.
.P You can use the setAnalysisMode -sequentialConstProp parameter to determine whether constants will be propagated through sequential elements.
.P Note: The timing_case_analysis_for_sequential_propagation global variable should not be used with the setAnalysisMode command. This global setting precedes previous settings and controls constant propagation through ICG cells.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
