.SH Name \fBread_twf\fR \-  Reads the external timing window file (TWF) for noise (Signal Integrity) and power calculation (Common Power Engine - CPE)
.SH Syntax \fBread_twf\fR  [-help]   [<filenames>]  [-cell <string>]  [-prefix <string>]  [-quiet]   [-reset]   [-scope <string>]   [-skipconst]   [-skiptw]   [-strip_prefix <string>]  [-verbose]  [-view <string>] 
.P Reads the external timing window file (TWF) for noise (Signal Integrity) and power calculation (Common Power Engine - CPE). This file is used to obtain clocks, constants, external load, slews, timing windows, and slack information. The external TWF specification is optional. In the absence of a TWF, this information is automatically derived using the Common Timing Engine (CTE), if timing constraints are read. 
.P Note: If the VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD construct is missing from the TWF file header, the values 10 and 90 are automatically assigned as the minimum and maximum threshold values, respectively. For example:
.P VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD (10 90) 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-cell <string> \fR" Specifies the master cell for the timing window file.   "\fB<filenames>\fR" Specifies the names of the timing window files.  "\fB-prefix <string>\fR" Adds a prefix to the net or pin name.  "\fB-quiet\fR" Skips information and warning messages.   "\fB-reset\fR" Clears the previously read TWF files.  "\fB-scope <string>\fR" Specifies the scope for the given hierarchical timing window file.  "\fB-skipconst\fR" Skips constant processing.  "\fB-skiptw\fR" Skips timing windows processing.  "\fB-strip_prefix\fR" Removes hierarchical path name.  "\fB-verbose\fR" Prints the command progress details.  "\fB-view string\fR" Specifies the view for the timing window file. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command reads the timing window file TW.in for the view 'view01', while skipping the constant processing from the timing window file:  read_twf TW.in -skipconst -view view01  "*" 2 The following command clears the previously read TWF file:  read_twf -reset
