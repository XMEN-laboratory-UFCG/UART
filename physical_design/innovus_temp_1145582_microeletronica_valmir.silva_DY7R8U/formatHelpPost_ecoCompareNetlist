.TH ecoCompareNetlist  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBecoCompareNetlist\fR \-  Compares a specified netlist with the design in the database for structural or logical equivalence, and creates a file containing the differences found
.SH Syntax \fBecoCompareNetlist\fR  [-help]  -def <referenceFileName>[-logical]   [-outfile <fileName>]  [-outputPhysicalInstInFile <physicalInstFile>]  [-referenceData {inMemory | external}]  
.P Compares a specified netlist with the design in the database for structural or logical equivalence, and creates a file containing the differences found.
.P ecoCompareNetlist supports bus top-level port comparison.
.P ecoDisableNetRenamingForFlatNetlist
.P Global variable ecoDisableNetRenamingForFlatNetlist is introduced. If it is set to 1, there would not be any net renaming for flat netlist. Net renaming will take place if net name is hierarchical and the terms it connects to do not fall under the same hierarchy or lies up in the hierarchy. Do set ecoDisableNetRenamingForFlatNetlist 1 before the ecoCompareNetlist command to disable net renaming for flat netlist. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.  "\fB-def <referenceFileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the DEF file that Innovus uses to compare with the design.  "\fB-referenceData [inMemory | external]\fR" Specifies the data from where the post-ECO netlist is to be compared.
.RS  "*" 2 inMemory compares the post-ECO netlist to the netlist in memory. inMemory is the default behavior.  "*" 2 external compares the post-ECO netlist to an external netlist.
.RE   "\fB-logical\fR" Compares the netlists for logical equivalence.  "\fB-outfile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the file that contains the differences between the specified DEF file and the design in the database.  If the directory specified to save the file does not exist, the tool creates the directory. For example, in the following command if a/ does not exist, the tool will create it:  ecoCompareNetlist -def test.def -outfile
./a/test.rpt  "\fB-outputPhysicalInstInFile <physicalInstFile>\fR" When this option is specified, physical instance eco command is also written to eco file, and the added physical instances names one per line are dumped into the <physicalInstFile> file. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command compares the myFile.def file against the design, and writes the results to differences.file:   ecoCompareNetlist -def myFile.def -outfile differences.file  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
