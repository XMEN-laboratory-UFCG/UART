.SH Name \fBreportVtInstCount\fR \-  Reports the instance distribution across the VT partitions in the design
.SH Syntax \fBreportVtInstCount\fR  [-help]   [-area]  [-detailed]  [-leakage]  [-outFile <fileName>]
.P Reports the instance distribution across the VT partitions in the design. By default, the Innovus software partitions the design into either two or three VT buckets. Each library, cell, and instance falls into one of these buckets and is reported by this command. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportVtInstCount parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man reportVtInstCount  "\fB-area\fR" Prints the area information across libraries in each VT partition.   "\fB-detailed \fR" Prints complete details in the specified file.  Note: Before specifying this parameter, you must specify the file name using the -outFile parameter.  "\fB-leakage\fR" Prints the leakage distribution across the libraries in each VT partition. When you specify this parameter, a complete leakage power analysis is performed on the design, which takes a little long to run.   "\fB-outFile <fileName>\fR" Prints the output in the specified file in the format required for user-defined VT partitioning.  Note: To print the same report that is output to the log that includes all leakage and instance information, specify the -detailed parameter. If you do not specify the -detailed parameter, the -outFile parameter will only print the VT partitions. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command outputs the Vt partitions to the file VT_Partitions.rpt:  reportVtInstCount -outFile Vt_Partitions.rpt  The Vt_Partitions.rpt file contains the following information:

.RS  "*" 2 The following commands output the Vt distribution as well as information in instances and cells. When the output file is not specified, the reportVtInstCount command outputs only to the log. The second command outputs both to the log and to the output file.   reportVtInstCount  reportVtInstCount -detailed -outFile VT_detailed.rpt  The report will contain the following information:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)    "*" 2  The following command outputs the Vt distribution as well as the area distribution across libraries in each VT partition:  reportVtInstCount -area  The report will contain the following information:  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2  The following commands output reports with the leakage power numbers included. The first command outputs only to the log. The second command outputs both to the log and to the output file.   reportVtInstCount -leakage  reportVtInstCount -leakage -detailed -outFile VT_detailed_leakage.rpt  The report will contain the following information:   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
