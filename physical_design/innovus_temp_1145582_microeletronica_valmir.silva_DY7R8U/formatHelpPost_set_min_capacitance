.TH set_min_capacitance  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_min_capacitance\fR
.SH Syntax \fBset_min_capacitance\fR  [-help]   <capacitance_limit>  <object_list>  [-clock_path]  [-data_path]  [-fall]   [-override]  [-rise] 
.P Sets the minimum capacitance limit on the specified ports of the top timing module and/or clock waveforms.
.P When set on a port, the total capacitance of the net connected to that port must be greater than or equal to the specified limit. When set on a module, the limit applies to all the nets of that module. The total capacitance of each net of the module must be greater than or equal the specified limit. The minimum capacitance limit also comes from library objects, which is the default minimum capacitance limit of libraries and minimum capacitance limit on library cell pins. Pins in the design inherit the limits from libraries. When limits are set on a module and the limit is inherited from libraries, the most constraining limit, which is the largest limit, is used.
.P Note: The limit set on the top timing module applies to its ports. Thus, if minimum capacitance limits are set on the top timing module and its ports, the most constraining limit will apply to the ports.
.P Use the report_ports -type port_cap_limit command to view the minimum capacitance limits set on ports.
.P When limits are set on a clock waveform, you can use -clock_path, -data_path, -rise, and -fall parameters to provide more specifications.
.P The set_min_capacitance constraint on clock objects will be honored only by the report_constraint command for DRV violations. The constraint will not be used in optimizations.
.P Note: This command syntax is applicable only when the flow-compatible mode is on. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-clock_path\fR" Specifies all pins that are in the network of the specific clocks in the object list.  "\fB-data_path\fR" Specifies all pins that are in the data paths launched by the specific clocks in the object list.  "\fB-fall\fR" Specifies falling capacitance.  "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies rising capacitance for all selected pins.  "\fB<capacitance_limit>\fR" Specifies the value for the minimum capacitance limit. The limit must be greater than or equal to zero. The limit is in capacitance units from the target technology library.  "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the list of objects - ports, instance pins, library cell pins, modules, and/or clock waveforms.  "\fB-override\fR" Overrides the minimum capacitance limit from other sources, such as, library or constraints.  This parameter can be used to force a specific constraint value for a specified list of instance pins/port/library cell pins - this overrides the maximum/minimum values set prior to this setting.  To enable this feature, make the following setting:  set timing_constraint_enable_drv_limit_override true 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following example sets a minimum capacitance limit of 0.02 units on all the ports of the top timing module and a minimum capacitance limit of 0.05 units on the top timing module:   set_min_capacitance 0.02 [get_ports *]  set_min_capacitance 0.05 [current_design]   The limit used for ports is 0.05, which is the most restrictive limit set on the top timing module (0.05) and the limit set on ports (0.02).
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following example uses the report_port command to show the minimum capacitance limit set on ports:  set_min_capacitance 0.02 [get_ports *]  report_ports -type port_cap_limit -pin [get_ports *]
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the minimum capacitance limit of 0.001 units on pins in the all_clocks collection:   set_min_capacitance 0.001 -data_path [all_clocks]   Example: Minimum Capacitance Limit Set on Ports Report  report_ports -type port_cap_limit -pin [get_ports *]  ----------------------------------------------------  Pin      Dir    Assertion         Value  Name  ----------------------------------------------------  CLK2    IN      port_cap_limit   ( 0.020 : 0.900 )  CLK1    IN      port_cap_limit   ( 0.020 : 0.900 )  in2     IN      port_cap_limit   ( 0.020 : 0.900 )  in1     IN      port_cap_limit   ( 0.020 : 0.900 )  out2    OUT     port_cap_limit   ( 0.020 : 0.900 )  out1    OUT     port_cap_limit   ( 0.020 : 0.900 )  ----------------------------------------------------
