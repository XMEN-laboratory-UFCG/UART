.SH Name \fBtiming_disable_black_box_endpoints\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_disable_black_box_endpoints\fR {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Ignores any boundary model endpoints on black box instances.
.P When set to false, the fanout logic from the block's input ports is traced for storing as timed logic within the boundary model. If a pin is reached with no outgoing timing arcs, this is considered an endpoint of the model and the fanin to that endpoint will be included in the model.
.P When set to true, such pins are ignored when they are on cells for which no timing or LEF cell definition was loaded. This is intended to make the model generation more tolerant of missing libraries in cases where the power/ground connectivity is included in the netlist.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
