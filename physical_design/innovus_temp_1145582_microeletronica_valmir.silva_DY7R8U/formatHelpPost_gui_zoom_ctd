.SH Name \fBgui_zoom_ctd\fR \-  Zooms into or out of the CTD window
.SH Syntax \fBgui_zoom_ctd\fR  [-help]  [-id <string>]  [-in | -out | -selected]  [-vertical_range {<ymin> <ymax>}]  
.P Zooms into or out of the CTD window. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Prints a brief description of the gui_zoom_ctd command.  For a detailed description of the command, use the man command: man gui_zoom_ctd.  "\fB-id <string>\fR" Specifies the window ID of the CTD window in which to zoom in or zoom out.   "\fB-in         \fR" Zoom into the CTD window.  "\fB-out         \fR" Zoom out of the CTD window.   "\fB-selected         \fR" Zoom to enclose all selected objects.  "\fB -vertical_range {<ymin> <ymax>}\fR" Zoom to a specific vertical latency range. If CTD is in timing-based mode, the window will zoom to the clock tree parts where latency is between <ymin> and <ymax>, and the unit is the same as global timing unit. If CTD is in unit delay mode, the window will zoom to the clock tree parts where stage depth is between <ymin> and <ymax>.  For example, if CTD is in timing-based mode, then the command,  gui_zoom_ctd -vertical_range {0 1.5} will zoom to the clock tree parts where latency is between 0 and 1.5, the unit is the same as get_time_unit. If CTD is in unit delay mode, then the command, gui_zoom_ctd -vertical_range {0 1.5} will zoom to the clock tree parts where stage depth is between 0 and 1.5.  Note: The window only zooms in vertical. 
.SH Examples
