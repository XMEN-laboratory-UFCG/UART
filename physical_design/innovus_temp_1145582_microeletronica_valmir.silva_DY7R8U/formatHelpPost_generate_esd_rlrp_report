.SH Name \fBgenerate_esd_rlrp_report\fR \-  Reports the least-resistance path (RLRP) for the bump-to-clamp rule type in the ESD flow
.SH Syntax  \fBgenerate_esd_rlrp_report\fR  [-help]  -net <netname>  [-instance_pair_list {{inst1 inst2 [pin1 pin2]}+} | -instance_pair_list_file <filename>]  [-number_threads <value>]  -state_directory <directory> 
.P Reports the least-resistance path (RLRP) for the bump-to-clamp rule type in the ESD flow. This command helps to make debugging faster when a fail status is given for a bump-to-clamp pair. Using this command, you can:
.RS  "*" 2 view the RLRP path for the selected bump-to-clamp pair in the GUI  "*" 2 generate a point-to-point RLRP path report that displays the resistance between each node (resistor segment) pair along the RLRP path

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.  "\fB-net <netname>\fR" Specifies the name of the net to be analyzed.   "\fB-number_threads <value>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of threads to use when reporting the least-resistance path (RLRP) for the bump-to-clamp rule type in the ESD flow. Generally, using more threads decreases the run time. There is no absolute limit to the number of threads you can use, however, it is recommended that you do not specify more threads than the number of CPUs available.   The default value is 1, and the maximum value that can be specified is the total number of available CPUs.  "\fB-instance_pair_list {{inst1 inst2 [pin1 pin2]}+}\fR" Specifies the instance pair list to enable effective resistance calculation between two instances in the design.  pin is an optional argument. By default, the tool will use the instance pin associated with the net being analyzed. The pin argument can be used in special cases when two different pins of an instance are connected to the same net.  <pin1>and <pin2>are pins of <inst2> respectively. If a pin name is not given, all pins associated to the specified instance are used.  "\fB-instance_pair_list_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the instance pair list file. This file contains the instance pair list in the same format as mentioned for the -instance_pair_list parameter. The file allows you to specify a large number of instance pairs.  -instance_pair_list_file and  -instance_pair_list are mutually exclusive.   "\fB-state_directory <directory>\fR" Specifies the name of the state directory in which the ESD analysis results are saved.
