.SH Name \fBtiming_spatial_derate_chip_size\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_spatial_derate_chip_size\fR <value_in_microns>  
.P Default: 1e+30
.P Allows you to define the chip size.
.P The chip size is the diagonal length of a rectangle that is formed by the chip's length and width. You can obtain the diagonal distance by calculating the square-root of the Length2 x Width2. The diagonal distance should always be specified in units of microns.
.P The chip size can be picked in the following ways (in order of highest to lowest precedence):
.RS  "*" 2 When set to a value other than 1e+30, the specified value will have the highest precedence.  "*" 2 If the physical floorplan information is available, the chip size will be derived automatically from the floorplan.  "*" 2 If the SPEF parasitic files containing the coordinate information are loaded, then the chip size will be automatically derived.
.RE
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
