.P Reports routing statistics for signal nets, including the following information:
.RS  "*" 2 Number of objects, such as cells, nets, and pins  "*" 2 Number and percentage of nets with one, two, three, four, or more terminals  "*" 2 Names and numbers of primitives used  "*" 2 EM statistics of nets.   "*" 2 NDR statistics of nets.  "*" 2 Net length and connection length statistics   These values are computed using the net bounding box half-perimeter.  The following figure shows a net bounding box for a net that must be connected to three terminals, t1, t2, and t3. The net bounding box is the perimeter of the smallest rectangle that can be formed that has sides passing through the three terminals. The half-perimeter is the length of x plus the length of y.

.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.) 
.RS  "*" 2 Total wire length and number of vias, per layer   These are the actual wire length and number of vias on each layer. The actual wire length might be different from the net bounding box half-perimeter if the net detours.  The layer statistics are in the last paragraph of the report.

.P Note: Use the reportWire command to generate a more detailed wire statistics report. Use the reportSpecialRoute command to generate a report for special nets.
.P You can use the reportRoute command after routing with any of the routing commands in the Innovus System software. 
.SH Parameter   "\fB-clock\fR" Reports statistics of clock nets.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-em\fR" Reports EM statistics of nets.   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportRoute parameter.   For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man reportRoute  "\fB-ndr\fR" Reports NDR statistics of nets.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-selected_net_only\fR" Reports statistics for selected nets only.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-via_pillar\fR" Reports stacking via statistics.  Data_type: bool, optional

.SH Example Report
.P In the example report the terms long connection, nrCon, and total length are used.
.RS  "*" 2 long net is a net that is longer than the last net listed in the report. In the report that follows, it is any net longer than 1.82e+06.  "*" 2 nrCon is the total number of I/O connections in the nets with long connections.  "*" 2 total length is the total wire length.
