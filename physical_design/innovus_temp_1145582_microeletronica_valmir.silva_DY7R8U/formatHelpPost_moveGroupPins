.TH moveGroupPins  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBmoveGroupPins\fR \-  Changes the pin layer, the pin size, pin status, resolves pin overlap, and moves a selected pin or pin group to a specific location. You can use this command after selecting the pin(s) in the move mode (selecting pins in the design display area with the Move/Resize/Reshape tool widget)
.SH Syntax \fBmoveGroupPins\fR  [-help]   [-depth <float>]  [-end_location {<x y>}]   [-expand_spacing_factor <float>]   [-layer <string>]   -loc {<x y>}  [-noFixed]   [-spacing <float>]   [-spread_type <string>]   [-start_location {<x y>}]   [-width <float>]   [-withOverlap]
.P Changes the pin layer, the pin size, pin status, resolves pin overlap, and moves a selected pin or pin group to a specific location. You can use this command after selecting the pin(s) in the move mode (selecting pins in the design display area with the Move/Resize/Reshape tool widget). 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each moveGroupPins parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man moveGroupPins  "\fB-depth <float>\fR" Specifies the depth of the pin or pin group, in micrometers.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-end_location {<x y>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates where the pins should end when the pins are spread along a range.   Data_type: point, optional   "\fB-expand_spacing_factor <float>\fR" Specifies the value that will be multiplied to the current spacing in tracks.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-layer <string>\fR" Specifies the number of the metal layer for the pin or pin group.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-loc {<x y>}  \fR" Specifies the new x and y location for the pin or pin group.  Data_type: point, required  "\fB-noFixed\fR" Specifies that the moved pins or group of pins are not set to the fixed status.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-spacing <float>\fR" Specifies the spacing between pins for multi-pin editing.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-spread_type <string>\fR" Specifies how spacing between pins is managed while moving grouped-pins.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-start_location {<x y>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates where the pins should start when the pins are spread along a range.   Data_type: point, optional   "\fB-width <float>\fR" Specifies the width of the pin or pin group, in micrometers.  Data_type: float, optional  "\fB-withOverlap                          \fR" Specifies that moved pin(s) can overlap.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command moves the selected pin group to a new location (10,20):  moveGroupPins -loc 10 20
