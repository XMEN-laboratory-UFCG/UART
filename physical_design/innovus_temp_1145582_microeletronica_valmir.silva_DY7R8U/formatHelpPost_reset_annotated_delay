.TH reset_annotated_delay  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreset_annotated_delay\fR
.SH Syntax \fBreset_annotated_delay\fR  {[-all] | [[-from <from_pins>] [-to <to_pins>]] | [<object_list>]} 
.P Resets annotated delay assertions that have been previously specified using the set_annotated_delay command. When you reset an annotated delay, the system uses the delays which are calculated from the original libs for the arc. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-all\fR" Resets all annotated delay assertions in the design.  "\fB-from <from_pins>\fR" Specifies timing arcs for which the delay is reset. The selected timing arcs are those that have their source pins specified using this option and the sink pins specified using the -to option. If this option is not specified, only timing arcs whose sink pins are specified using the -to option are selected.  "\fB<object_list>\fR" Resets the annotated delays on specified list or collection of cell instances.  "\fB-to <to_pins>\fR" Specifies timing arcs for which the delay is reset. The selected timing arcs are those that have their sink pins specified using this option and the source pins specified using the -from option. If this option is not specified, only timing arcs whose source pins are specified using the -from option are selected.
