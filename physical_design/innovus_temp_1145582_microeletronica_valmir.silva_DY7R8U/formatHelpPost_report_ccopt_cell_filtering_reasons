.SH Name \fBreport_ccopt_cell_filtering_reasons\fR \-  Reports the reasons for filtering the specified cell types
.SH Syntax \fBreport_ccopt_cell_filtering_reasons\fR  [-help]   [-cell_type buffer | inverter | logic | delay | clock_gate]   [-clock_trees {string1 string2
...}]   [-file <file_name>]   [-power_domain <power_domain_name>]   [-tcl_list] 
.P Reports the reasons for filtering the specified cell types. The report can be saved as a file by specifying the -file parameter of the command or it can be viewed as a Tcl list by specifying the -tcl_list parameter. The output of the command is also included in the log.
.P In the report, "all" is used for the Clock tree names where the reason is common to all clock_trees. Some of the reasons for filtering that are reported and their brief descriptions are provided below:
.RS  "*" 2 Unbalanced rise/fall delays : The difference between rise and fall delays for the cell is bigger than 20%; or any of rise or fall timing arcs is missing in the library.  "*" 2 Too tall: The cell height is bigger than the maximum cell height specified using the max_cell_height property.  "*" 2 Wrong power context : The cell does not match the power context requirements. For example, do not have same power context on all pins.  "*" 2 Not available in all views : The cell is not available in all analysis views because the library does not contain all the specified views (corner cases) in the design for that specific cell. To avoid this filtering, check the libraries and the MMMC configuration to see why the cell is not available in some views.  "*" 2 Always on but not in cpf: The cell is marked as always on but does not match the CPF description. You can avoid this filtering by checking/updating the CPF.  "*" 2 Weak max cap cell: The cell is unable to drive enough capacitance at certain clock frequencies. This check is controlled by the CCOpt property, frequency_dependent_max_cap_usability_check_max_cap_fanout_factor. The default value of this property is 4. The cells that cannot drive four instances of that cell are filtered. You can reduce this value to avoid the filtering, for example, by relaxing the requirement so that the cell only has to be able to drive one or two instances. Alternatively, since this is controlled by the period on the clock_tree, you can check the effective_clock_period property to see if those are correct.  "*" 2 Library trimming: The cell was removed automatically because it is an inefficient cell. The cell was removed as an inefficient cell to reduce the library size and save runtime. To avoid removing such cells, disable library trimming.  "*" 2 Can't use due to library mismatch: Check the library data for the cell - both timing and physical data for the cell are needed. There is a mismatch between LEF and liberty libraries because the cell is missing in one of them.  "*" 2 Invalid for balancing: The cell is filtered out because it does not match several predefined properties for balancing, such as: 1) cell delay is too small; 2)cell has an invalid (rise/fall) timing arc.  "*" 2 No test enable signal: The clock gate cell is filtered out because it does not have a test enable input.   "*" 2  Has test enable signal: The clock gate cell is filtered out because it has a test enable input.   Note: The above two cell filtering reasons are context dependent. The software filters all clock gates, reporting the clock gates with test enables as one set and the clock gates without test enables as another set. A clock gate either has a test enable or it does not have one, so all clock gates are listed in one of the two sets. However, if you need a clock gate with no test enable signal, but there are no such clock gates, you can use a clock gate that has a test enable signal. But the other way around is not possible, which means if you need a clock gate with test enable signal but there is no such clock gate, you cannot use one that does not have a test enable signal.  "*" 2 Has observable output: Clock gates without observability outputs are preferred, if they are available. Normally any cells with observability outputs will be filtered out. But if all the available cells have observability outputs they will not be filtered.  "*" 2 Edge sensitive: The clock gate cell is filtered out because it is not positive edge sensitive.  "*" 2 Cannot be legalized: The cell is filtered because it cannot physically be legalized in the power domain.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each report_ccopt_cell_filtering_reasons parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man  report_ccopt_cell_filtering_reasons.   "\fB-cell_type buffer | inverter | logic | delay | clock_gate     \fR" Restrict the report the specified library cell type.    "\fB-clock_trees {string1 string2
...}\fR" Restricts the report to the specified clock trees   "\fB-file <file_name>\fR" Specifies that a copy of  the contents of the report will be saved to the specified file name.   "\fB-power_domain <power_domain_name>\fR" Restricts the report to the specified power domain.   "\fB-tcl_list\fR" Returns the report as Tcl formatted data, and formats the -file as tcl, if specified.
