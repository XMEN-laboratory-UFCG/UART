.SH Name \fBgenerateCapTbl\fR \-  Reads in the interconnect technology (ICT) process file and generates a Capacitance table file
.SH Syntax \fBgenerateCapTbl\fR   [-help]  [-cap <totalCapFactor>]  [-encrypt]  -output <fileName>  [-res <resistanceFactor>]   [-xcap <crossCouplingFactor>]  [-lef <fileName> [-shrinkFactor <value>]]   {-ict <fileName> | -incaptable <fileName>}  
.P Reads in the interconnect technology (ICT) process file and generates a Capacitance table file. The Capacitance table file contains a header having a summary of process information and manufacturing effects followed by tables containing coefficients used during RC extraction.
.P The capacitance table is used both for preRoute extraction (above 32nm) and postRoute extraction -effortLevel low.
.P Note: For TQuantus, IQuantus, preRoute extraction (32nm and below), and Standalone Quantus, a Quantus Techfile is needed instead of a Capacitance table.
.P The generateCapTbl command automatically omits the creation of coefficients for the poly layers, local interconnect layers, and mimcap layers. The generateCapTbl command recognizes poly layers by the gate_forming_layer true statement.
.P Note: The command accepts ICT files that contain the gate_forming_layer true construct in multiple conductor sections to allow handling of diffusion models as a conductor. In this case, the Innovus captable generation process ignores all but the last gate_forming_layer true construct. The last one is considered as poly and is used as the ground plate level for the metal layers above.    Note: The command does not support grown_from_conformal (non-planar stack) construct defined in the ICT file.     Note: You can use the multi-CPU processing commands to generate a capacitance table in the parallel mode. However, this functionality is only available when invoking generateCapTbl from the software prompt, and not from the standalone utility generateCapTbl.  To generate a capacitance table file in the parallel mode, you must first set up the multiple-CPU processing mode using the multiple-CPU processing commands.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each generateCaptbl parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man generateCaptbl.   "\fB-cap <totalCapFactor>\fR" Specifies the capacitance scale factor. Use this parameter with the -incaptable parameter to generate a capacitance table with capacitance values scaled by the specified scale factor.   "\fB-encrypt\fR" Encrypts the generated capacitance table to protect the process information in the capacitance table header. When you use the create_rc_corner -cap_table command to read the encrypted capacitance table, the software writes the version number that was used to generate the file, and the name of the process to the log file.   "\fB-ict <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name and path to the ICT (interconnect technology) process file.  To support multiple process corners, a capacitance table should be created for each corner from the matching corner ICT file.  "\fB-incaptable <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of an existing capacitance table in ASCII format. You use this parameter along with the -encrypt parameter to create an encrypted version of an existing capacitance file.  Note: The -ict and -incaptable parameters are mutualy exclusive. One of the two parameters must be specified.  "\fB-lef <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name and the full path to the process LEF file for optimal accuracy. With the LEF file, this parameter generates a capacitance table by using the actual wire widths as specified in the non-default rules defined in the LEF. Without the LEF, the software uses generic widths and spacings, which might increase the need for interpolation during extraction.   "\fB-output <fileName>\fR" Specifies the output filename that contains the capacitance table. This is a required parameter.   "\fB-res <resistanceFactor>\fR" Specifies the resistance scale factor. Use this parameter with the -incaptable parameter to generate a capacitance table with resistance values scaled by the specified scale factor.   "\fB-shrinkFactor <value>\fR" Specifies the value by which the measurements in the optional LEF file have to be shrunk for the technology used with this design. Use this parameter only with the -lef parameter and when the LEF technology does not match the target technology in the ICT file. Innovus scales the dimensions when reading the LEF file using the shrinkFactor specified. The ICT file should always refer to the target technology (min width and min spacing).  Note: When working on a design that needs to be scaled down in Innovus, you must also set the shrinkfactor in Design Import. This tells the extractor to scale down all geometries before processing.  When the ICT file contains a layout_scale in the process declaration part, you do not need to specify the shrink factor. In this case, the embedded shrink factor will also be written in the captable header. Also, there is then no need to set the shrink factor in the Design Import form. The embedded layout_scale is used to support half nodes such as 40nm technology.  Default: 1.0  "\fB-xcap <crossCouplingFactor>\fR" Specifies the cross-coupling capacitance scale factor. Use this parameter with the -incaptable parameter to generate a capacitance table with cross-coupling capacitance values scaled by the specified scale factor. 
.SH Example
.P The following command reads in the ICT file test.ict, and generates a new.capTbl output file:
.P generateCapTbl -ict test.ict -output new.CapTbl
