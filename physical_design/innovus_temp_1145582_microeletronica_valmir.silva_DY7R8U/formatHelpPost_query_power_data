.TH query_power_data  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBquery_power_data\fR \-  The query_power_data command allows you to query the binary current files (.ptiavg/.ptipeak) that Power Calculation/Rail Analysis creates.  It reads the tap current data in the current files and reports various information for debugging
.SH Syntax  \fBquery_power_data\fR  [-help]   [<<in_file> <<file1>[<file2>]
...>>]  [-average_current]  [-clock_average]  [-dump_pwl]  [-frame <<string>>]  [-instance_list <<inst_list>>]  [-instance_list_file <filename>]  [-list]  [-output <<string>>]  [-peak_current]  [-peak_time]  [-pin]  [-time_steps]  [-stdout]  [-total_current <<input_current_file>>]  [-output_tap_name <<tap_name>>] 
.P The query_power_data command allows you to query the binary current files (.ptiavg/.ptipeak) that Power Calculation/Rail Analysis creates.  It reads the tap current data in the current files and reports various information for debugging.
.P 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.   "\fB<<in_file> <<file1>[<file2>]
...>> \fR" Specifies the names of the VDD and VSS instance voltage pti files.  "\fB-average_current \fR" Specifies to write the average current of all instances.   "\fB-clock_average \fR" Specifies to write the clock based current report.  "\fB-dump_pwl \fR" Specifies to write the tap current in the PWL format. You can use this parameter to view the contents of the binary data file.  "\fB-frame <<string>> \fR" Specifies intervals for the clock_average report.   "\fB-instance_list <<inst_list>>\fR" Specify the list of instances to be dumped in the ASCII format, one instance per line. If not specified, it prints all instances. The -instance_list parameter is specified with the -dump_pwl, -peak_current, -peak_time, and-average_current parameters.  "\fB-instance_list_file <filename>\fR" Specifies a file with the list of instances to be dumped in the ASCII format.   "\fB-list \fR" Specifies to write the tap names from the input file.  "\fB-output <<string>>  \fR" Specifies the name of the output file.   "\fB-output_tap_name <<tap_name>>\fR" Specifies the name of the output tap in the new current file, which is created using the -total_current parameter.   "\fB-peak_current \fR" Specifies to write the peak current of all instances   "\fB-peak_time\fR" Specifies to write the peak current time of all instances.   "\fB-pin \fR" Specifies to print the pin names with the instance names. The -pin parameter is specified with the  -dump_pwl and  -list parameters.   "\fB-stdout\fR" Specifies to print the report to standard output.   "\fB-time_steps  \fR" Specifies to summarize the minimum current, maximum current, average current, and total current for each interval in the data file. You can use this data to estimate which interval in a transient response might contain the worst-case data.   "\fB-total_current <<input_current_file> <output_total_current_file>>\fR" Specifies to create a new current (.ptiavg) file containing the total current for all taps of a net. This parameter can be used if you have a very large current file generated by the Power Calculation engine and want to see only a total current waveform in the SimVision waveform viewer.  <input_current_file> is the current file that will be read in (output from the Power Calculation engine).  Use the following syntax to create a total current file:  query_power_data -total_current <<input_current_file>>  -output <<output_total_current_file>>  Note: -output is used to specify a user-defined output current filename, and is not a mandatory parameter. If not specified, the output file will be generated automatically with the name of the input file suffixed with
.ptiavg. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command creates a total current waveform file VDD from the input file dynamic_VDD.ptiavg:  query_power_data -output_tap_name vdd_tap -total_current dynamic_VDD.ptiavg -output VDD
