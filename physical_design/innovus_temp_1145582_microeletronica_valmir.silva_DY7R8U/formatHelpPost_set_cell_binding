.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each set_cell_binding parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man set_cell_binding.  "\fB-abstract\fR" Replaces in-memory cell information for the matched cells.  "\fB-cell <list_of_cell_patterns>\fR" Specifies one or more cell name patterns that are to be replaced.  "\fB-lib <list_of_libs>\fR" Specifies the OpenAccess library that is to be used to look for cell abstracts.  "\fB-view <list_of_views>\fR" Specifies the cellview name.
