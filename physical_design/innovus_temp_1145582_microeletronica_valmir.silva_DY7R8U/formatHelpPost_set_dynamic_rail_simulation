.SH Name \fBset_dynamic_rail_simulation\fR \-  An optional command to set the parameters for dynamic rail analysis
.SH Syntax  \fBset_dynamic_rail_simulation\fR  [-help]   [-start <value>]  [-stop <value>]  [-resolution <value>]  [-reset]  [-auto_repeat] 
.P An optional command to set the parameters for dynamic rail analysis. By default, dynamic rail analysis uses the start time, stop time, and resolution from current data file. To analyze fewer clock cycles, you can choose different start and stop times using the -start and -stop options. It is recommended that at least one or two full cycles are simulated to fully charge and discharge the on-chip capacitance. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each set_dynamic_rail_simulation parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command man set_dynamic_rail_simulation.  "\fB-auto_repeat\fR" Specifies to repeat the dynamic current waveform till the -stop time specified.  If  -stop is not specified, all the waveforms will repeat till the longest waveform duration. The  -auto_repeat parameter can be used when multiple dynamic current files have different simulation periods or when IR drop analysis needs to be run for longer duration.  The following command sets the dynamic simulation time from 20ns to 100ns in which the current data will be repeated until 100ns is reached:  set_dynamic_rail_simulation -start 20ns -auto_repeat -stop 100ns  The -repeat parameter of the set_power_data command has higher priority than  set_dynamic_rail_simulation -auto_repeat, as shown in the following example:  set_power_data  VDD1.ptiavg -repeat 50  set_power_data  VDD2.ptiavg  set_dynamic_rail_simulation -auto_repeat -stop 100  In this example, VDD1 waveform will repeat till 50ns, while VDD2 waveform will repeat till 100ns.  "\fB-reset\fR" Resets all the previous set_dynamic_rail_simulation command settings to the default settings.  "\fB-resolution<value>\fR" By default rail analysis picks up the resolution (or step size) saved in the dynamic current files. To achieve better rail analysis performance, you can increase the step size using this option. However, using larger than two times the step size of current data file is not recommended as it can impact accuracy of dynamic IR drop analysis. You can specify the units with the value. If you do not specify a unit, the software uses the default unit.  Default: Picoseconds (ps).  "\fB-start <value>\fR" Defines the start time to be used for dynamic rail analysis. This option is used with the -stop option and enables you to perform a more detailed analysis in specific time ranges. You can specify the units with the value. If you do not specify a unit, the software uses the default unit.  Default: The default unit is nanoseconds (ns). The default value is the start time from current data file. The start time in the current data file is usually 0ns.  "\fB-stop<value>\fR" Defines the stop time to be used for dynamic rail analysis. This option is used with the -start option and enables you to perform a more detailed analysis in specific time ranges. You can specify the units with the value. If you do not specify a unit, the software uses the default unit.  Default: The default unit is nanoseconds (ns). The default value is the end of the current data. If multiple current files are specified and they all have different simulation periods, the largest simulation period is used to decide the stop time. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the dynamic simulation time from 2ns to 12ns with a resolution of 100ps:   set_dynamic_rail_simulation -start 2ns -stop 12ns -resolution 100ps
