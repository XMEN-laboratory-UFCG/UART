.P Removes the constraints for a partition pin. You can use this command after setting the pin's constraints with the setPinConstraint command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-all_area\fR" Specifies that spacing constraints on all areas should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-all_user\fR" Specifies that all user specified constraints should be removed from all levels (-global, -cell, and -pin level).  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies that the area overlapping with partition for which the spacing constraints have been specified should be removed.  Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-cell <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the cell (partition). The cell name is not required if the command is run on a top-level cell.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-corner <corner_number>\fR" Specifies the corner of the partition block.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-corner_to_pin_distance\fR" Specifies that the corner to pin distance  constraints should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-depth\fR" Specifies the pin depth related constraints should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-edge\fR" Specifies that edge-related constraints should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-global\fR" Specifies to reset global constraints.        Data_type: bool, optional                      "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each unsetPinConstraint parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man unsetPinConstraint  "\fB-layer\fR" Specifies that the layer-related constraints should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-loc\fR" Specifies that the location-related constraints should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pin <pin_name_list>\fR" Specifies the name of the partition pin. You can use wildcards (*?) with this parameter.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-side <side> <_name>\fR" Specifies name of the side. Valid values are { N S E W } or  { L B T R } or all.    Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-spacing\fR" Specifies that the spacing-related constraints should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-special_wire\fR" Specifies that the depth constraint that is honored for special wire pins by the partition command should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-pinTemplate {<layer_id_or_name_list> }\fR" Specifies the metal layers for the width and depth constraints at global level and cell level.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-width <width>\fR" Specifies that the pin width related constraints should be removed.  Data_type: bool, optional
