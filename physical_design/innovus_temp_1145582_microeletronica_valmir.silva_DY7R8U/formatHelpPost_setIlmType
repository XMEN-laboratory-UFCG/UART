.SH Name \fBsetIlmType\fR \-  Controls the behavior of commands in the presence of ILMs
.SH Syntax  \fBsetIlmType\fR  [-help]  [-model {timing | si}] 
.P Controls the behavior of commands in the presence of ILMs.
.P ILM models can be an SI model or a non-SI model. In the flow, sometimes an explicit flattenIlm needs to be performed to perform the underlying operation. Based on the nature of operation, an appropriate model could be invoked/switched with the above command.
.P Use the getIlmType command to display the current settings for the setIlmType command. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setIlmType parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man setIlmType.  "\fB-model {timing | si}\fR" Specifies the ILM model that is to be used by the flattenIlm command. All the timing-related commands require data to be in the flattened state (physical command require unflattened state).  Design commands such as optDesign and timeDesign automatically set this parameter before flattening ILMs. However, the CTE commands and some clock commands, which can be run in the flattened mode require manual settings.
.RS  "*" 2 Use the si model for flattening the SI ILM model.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Use the timing model for flattening the non-SI related timing commands.
.RE   Note: In case of non-merged models, use the cts model before running flattenIlm followed by the command which directly deals with the clocks.  Default: timing 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command is used to report clock tree in the presence of ILMs:   flattenIlm  reportClockTree  unflattenIlm  The unflattenIlm command resets -model to its default value timing since the next command is not a clock command.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command can be used to get timing reports containing the SI push-out delays on nets using the -setIlmType-model command:   setIlmType -model si  # Flattens to SI model  flattenIlm  # Turns on SI aware delay calculation  setDelayCalMode -SIAware true  # Adds incremental delay column (for SI push-out delays)  #  in timing output:  set_global_report_timing_format {instance arc cell fanout load slew delay incr_delay arrival}  # Minimizes the width of the report such that it easily   # fits into the screen without wrapping  set_table_style -name report_timing -no_frame -indent 0  report_timing
