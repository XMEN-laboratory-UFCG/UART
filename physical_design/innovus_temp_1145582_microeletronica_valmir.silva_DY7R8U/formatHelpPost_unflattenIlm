.SH Name \fBunflattenIlm\fR \-  Reverts the ILM back to its original hard macro view
.SH Syntax \fBunflattenIlm\fR  [-help] 
.P Reverts the ILM back to its original hard macro view.
.P You can use this command after the      flattenIlm    command.
.P Note: unflattenIlm will take no effect if the design is already in the unflattened mode. 
.P Many physical commands would not work in the flattened mode. They would need to be unflattened before performing the operation.
.P For example:
.P flattenIlm
.P report_timing
.P unflattenIlm 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the usage of the unflattenIlm command. 
.SH Example
.P The following command flattens all partitions and their ILM designs to the top-level. After reporting timing, the design is reverted back to the unflattened state with the unflattenIlm command.
.P flattenIlm
.P report_timing
.P unflattenIlm
