.SH Name \fBreportMultibit\fR \-  Reports all the multi-bit flip-flops that have been identified during loading the design
.SH Syntax \fBreportMultibit\fR  [-help]   [-outFile <file_name>]   [-cell <cell_name> | -library | -reasonNotMerged <unmerged_reason> | -notMergedSummary | -equiv]   [-cell <cell_name> | -type {comb | latch | flop | seq | iso | ls}]   [-hinst <hinst_name> | -library | -cell <cell name> | -equiv]
.P Reports all the multi-bit flip-flops that have been identified during loading the design. Use this command after all the libraries are loaded. When this command is specified with no parameters, a default summary report is printed.  By default, the sequential cells will be reported. Both, the multi-bit percentages merged, and a summary of why flops were not merged is printed. This is equivalent to the reportMultiBitFFs -statistics, with the addition of unused bits.
.P There are three basic types of multibit:  sequential, combo, and isolation/level shifter. This command supports specifying the type of multibit to report. The -type parameter is a global filter for all other options. 
.P The default option is seq. If -type option is not specified then reporting will take place for sequential cells. 
.P A set of options separated by a "|" in one "[ ]" listed below cannot be used together and the software will report an error in that case. Although options from different "[ ]" can be coupled together. The sets of mutually exclusive options are provided below.

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportMultibit parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man reportMultibit.  "\fB-cell <cell_name>\fR" Reports the cell details and equivalence information of a single library cell.   "\fB-equiv\fR" Reports equivalence summary of the library cells of the selected type.   "\fB-hinst <hinst_name>\fR" Specifies the hinst on which the reporting is to be done. The default is the design.   "\fB-library\fR" Reports the flip-flop/latch equivalence. This parameter is similar to the reportMultiBitFFs -all -info/-equiv setting.    This parameter honors the -type parameter setting.  "\fB-notMergedSummary\fR" When specified, reports the summary of unmerged instances.   "\fB-outFile <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file.   "\fB-reasonNotMerged {Partition CellEquivalent Constraint ScanConnection Location Timing Power User Legalization Bus BankLabelRegister BankLabelPartition All}\fR" Reports the instances that could not be merged for the specified reason. Specify any of the reasons in the argument or specify all to report all instances along with the reason why they could not be merged.  Partition: odd number of flops in one partition  CellEquivalent: no usable equivalent multi-bit flip-flop cell  Constraint: Constraints by sdc, rule, or user settings  ScanConnection: no scan connection to other flops in the same group  Location: too far away with other flops in the same group  Timing: exceed critical path threshold or MBFF merging that degrades timing  Power: all available multi-bit cells causing power degradation  User: user set to be excluded in flop merge  Bus: non-bus flops  All: all the reasons of not merged  "\fB-type {comb | latch | flop | seq | iso | ls}\fR" Reports for the specified type of cells. By default, only sequentials are reported. You can specify anyone of the following reports:  comb: reports all multibit cells implementing a combinational function. For example, a cell implementing 3 ANDs - so, 6 inputs and 3 outputs  latch:  reports multi-bit latches in the design.  flop: reports multi-bit flops.  seq: reports all sequential cells.  isolation/level shifter (iso/ls): reports multi-bit cells implementing a low power function. For example, as 8-bit level-shifter cell.  Default: seq
