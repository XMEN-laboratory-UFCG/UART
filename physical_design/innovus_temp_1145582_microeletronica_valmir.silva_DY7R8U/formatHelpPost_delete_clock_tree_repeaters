.SH Name \fBdelete_clock_tree_repeaters\fR
.SH Syntax \fBdelete_clock_tree_repeaters\fR
.P [-help]  [-force]
.P This command removes buffers and inverter pairs from the clock trees. If used without specifying any parameters, it deletes all repeaters except those that have fixed or dont_touch attributes that are assigned either by the user or by ccopt_design. To delete all repeaters, specify the -force parameter.
.P Note: After running the command, there may be remaining inverters in the clock tree that are required to preserve an inversion. The remaining inverters may not be the same as the ones that were originally introduced for inversion, which means that the naming can differ. 
.SH Parameter   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each  delete_clock_tree_repeaters parameter. For a detailed description of the command and its parameter, use the man command:  man delete_clock_tree_repeaters.   "\fB-force\fR" Deletes all repeaters even if they have fixed or dont_touch attributes defined.
