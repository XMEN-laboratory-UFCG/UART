.P Writes a netlist file of the design. By default, a logical netlist is saved. The netlist is in hierarchical Verilog format only if the original netlist loaded was hierarchical. The Innovus software saves the netlist from the top level of the hierarchy to the bottom level of the hierarchy if the original netlist is specified from top to bottom. If you run this command after using loadDefFile, it bundles bus pins to create busses in Verilog. Saving the netlist is done after running placement with timing driven option, clock tree synthesis, scan group re-order, or IPO.
.P You can use this command after importing the design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each saveNetlist parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man saveNetlist.  "\fB-abstract\fR" Writes an empty Verilog module with port declarations for the specified module.  You can use the -abstract parameter with the following parameters:
.RS  "*" 2 -includePowerGround   "*" 2 -excludeTopCellPGPort  "*" 2 -derivePGPortDir  "*" 2 -exportTopPGNets  "*" 2 -module  "*" 2 -phys
.RE   Default: Top module  "\fB-applyMaskShift\fR" Adds a suffix to the cell name of a leaf instance based on the color assignments of the instance.  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 The netlist must be unique or -flat must specified for the option to take effect.  "*" 2 The mask shifted netlist cannot be read back into Innovus, as the cell names with suffix do not actually exist in LEF and timing libraries.
.RE   "\fB-cellInstanceColor {true | false}\fR" Specifies to use the instance-based color.   "\fB-cellMasterColor {true | false}]\fR" Specifies to use the cell master-based color from the Innovus color engine.  "\fB-derivePGPortDir\fR" Specifies whether to derive (vs. assume) directions of implicit PG ports in saving a physical netlist.   "\fB-excludeCellDef <cellName>\fR" Excludes the module definition of the specified cells.  "\fB-excludeCellInst <cellName>\fR" Excludes the instances of the specified cells from the netlist. You can exclude logical or physical instances.  The <cellName> can be a single cell name or a list of cell names separated by a space and surrounded by braces ({}) or double quotation marks ("").  For example: -excludeCellInst {cell1 cell2} or "cell1 cell2".  "\fB-excludeIlm\fR" Excludes the ILM module.   "\fB-excludeLeafCell\fR" Writes I/O instances, macro or block instances, and standard cell instances to the netlist, but does not include leaf cell definitions in the netlist.  "\fB-excludeTopCellPGPort <portName>\fR" Excludes specified power and ground port(s) from the top cell's module port list.  The <portName> can be a single port name or a list of port names separated by a space and surrounded by braces ({}) or double quotation marks ("").  For example: -excludeTopCellPGPort {VSS VDD} or "VSS VDD".  "\fB-exportTopPGNets\fR" Specifies to use top-cell PG nets as ports for the top module in a physical netlist created with the -phys or -includePowerGround option.  "\fB<fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the file where the netlist is written.  "\fB-flat\fR" Writes a flattened Verilog netlist.  Default: If you omit this parameter, and if the original netlist loaded was hierarchical, the netlist is written in hierarchical Verilog format.  "\fB-flattenBus\fR" Writes a flattened-bus Verilog netlist. When this parameter is used, a bus bit, such as "A[0]" is output as "\\A[0]". If such conversions conflict with existing object names, saveNetlist warns about such conflicts and returns an error:  **WARN: (ENCDB-2156): Cannot rename bus-bit %s '%s' in cell '%s' because the name '%s' is already in use on %s in that cell. Change the design to remove the conflicting name or run the command without the -flattenBus option.  **ERROR: (ENCSYC-1279): Cannot output flatten-bus netlist due to the reported object-name conflicts.  "\fB-followLogicalModuleOrder \fR" Follows the logical module order.  The order of the modules, written without -includePowerGround, in a hierarchical logical netlist is different from that, written with the option, in a hierarchical PG netlist.  If -followLogicalModuleOrder is specified together with -includePowerGround (but not -flat) the order of the modules in a physical netlist will be the same as that in a logical netlist.  Note: The same order is for non-leaf modules only.  "\fB-ignoreFixedMask\fR" Ignores cell fixedMask when maskShift is applied.   "\fB-ilm\fR" Writes out a netlist with ILM guts.  Note: This parameter can be specified only in the flattenIlm state. If this parameter is specified in the unflatten state, the software returns an error message.  "\fB-includeBumpCell\fR" Writes bump cell information to the netlist. You can also use -includeBumpCell with logical netlist.  Note: This parameter is effective only when used with either the -phys or -flat parameters.  "\fB-includePhysicalCell <cellName>\fR" Includes the physical instances of the specified cells in the netlist. With this parameter, 1'b1/1'b0-style, logical connections are used for tie-off pins.  The <cellName> can be a single cell name or a list of cell names separated by a space and surrounded by braces ({}) or double quotes (""), for example, -includePhysicalCell {cell1 cell2} or "cell1 cell2".  Default: If you omit this parameter, no physical cell module definitions will be in the netlist file.  Note: -includePhysicalCell creates a netlist that should not be read back into Innovus.  "\fB-includePowerGround\fR" By default, PG connections in the original logical Verilog netlist are already written out (unless -flat is given). You can add "physical only" global PG net connections and "physical only" PG nets added by IEEE1801 to the Verilog output with this option.  It adds PG nets inside each module and PG ports on each module in order to thread the PG connections to each pin.  Some physical tools like LVS prefer to have these explicitly in the hierarchical Verilog.  "\fB-includePhysicalInst\fR" Activates physical netlisting by including physical instances, such as fillers, in the netlist. With this parameter, GNC-based/physical connections, such as vss, are used for tie-off pins.  "\fB-keepAllBackslash\fR" Keeps all backslashes in names.   "\fB-lineLength <characters_per_line>\fR" Specifies the maximum number of characters per line for module port lists and instance port connections. When a line length exceeds the specified value, the software wraps the line at the next opportunity. You must specify a non-negative integer for the value.  <Default:> 0 (The software wraps lines at the earliest opportunity.)  "\fB-maskShiftSuffix <maskShiftSuffix>\fR" Adds a user-specified suffix to the cell name of a leaf instance instead of the tool's default suffix.  The default suffix is _<layer>_<mask>. For example, BUFX1_M0_1 default suffix means the M0 color flipped from mask 0 to mask 1.   The -maskShiftSuffix option works only when -applyMaskShift is used.   Note: The netlist must be unique or -flat must specified for the option to take effect.  "\fB-module <moduleName>\fR" Saves the specified module of the netlist.  "\fB-omitFloatingPort\fR" Omits the unconnected instance ports from the saved netlist.  "\fB-onlyLeafCell\fR" Writes only leaf cell definitions in the netlist.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the software writes leaf cell definitions, standard cell instances, and macro/block instances in the netlist file.  "\fB-onlyMacro\fR" Writes only macro or block cell definitions to the netlist.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the software writes leaf cell definitions, standard cell instances, and macro/block instances in the netlist file.  "\fB-onlyStdCell\fR" Writes only standard cell instances in the netlist.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, the software writes leaf cell definitions, standard cell instances, and macro/block instances in the netlist file.  "\fB-phys\fR" Writes out physical cell instances, and inserts power and ground nets in the netlist. This is used for LVS and for designs with multiple supply voltages. Hierarchical power and ground nets are also supported.  Note: -phys creates a netlist that should not be read back into Innovus.  "\fB-removePowerGround\fR" Removes PG ports, PG nets, PG pin connections, and replaces PG net connections on signal pins with 1'b1 or 1'b0.  "\fB-replaceTieConnection\fR" Replaces 1'b1 and 1'b0 constants with undriven nets in the output netlist. Use this parameter if you may want to save a Verilog netlist from Innovus without any 1'b* constants.  Note: By default, the saveNetlist command writes a Verilog netlist file of the design using 1'b* constants to represent Assign nets and ports. However, subsequent verification steps that you use outside Innovus might not be able to handle these 1'b* constants. In such a case, use -replaceTieConnection.  "\fB-replaceWorWandWithWire\fR" Replaces wor/wand with wire statement.  "\fB-replace_inout_with_output_for_pg_ports\fR" Changes the direction of inout P/G ports to output except for the ones defined by IEEE1801/UPF.  Their directions remain unchanged.  "\fB-topCell <cellName>\fR" Saves the specified module along with its submodules.   If you use saveNetlist -topCell, tool only saves the top cell in the netlist file, and if you use saveNetlist without -topCell, the tool saves all modules in the netlist file.  "\fB-topModuleFirst \fR" Writes out top module first, followed by the rest of the modules.  Note: This feature is not available for physical netlist writing. As a result, the -topModuleFirst option will be ignored if any of the following parameters is also specified: -phys, -includePowerGround, and -includePhysicalInst.  "\fB-useCdsThruForAssign\fR" Replaces the assign statement with cds_thru, the output netlist will not be able to read back by Innovus. This is only for third party tool.  "\fB-useEEQCellMap {<masterCell EEQcell1 EEQcell2>}\fR" Defines the master cell and the EEQ cells that need to be mapped to the master cell {{masterCell EEQcell1 EEQcell2}
...}   "\fB-useEEQCellWithLibertyInfo  \fR" Specifies to use the EEQ cell with the timing library information as the master cell of a leaf instance.  "\fB-writeConstantForSignalConnection\fR" Writes constant value for tie pin connection. When this option is specified, tool can assign the tie net name to related signal pin. If this option is not specified, tool assigns the real net name to the signal pin.   "\fB-writeSupply0Supply1\fR" -writeSupply0Supply1 must be specified together with -phys or -includePowerGround to take effect.  Its default is off, with which a PG net is written as "supply0/supply1" only if it defined as such in the original Verilog. When on, PG nets are written as "supply0" or "supply1" except for implicit (see IEEE1801) PG nets, which are written as "wire" as needed.
