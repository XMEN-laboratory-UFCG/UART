.SH Name \fBreportMultiBitFFs\fR \-  Reports all the multi-bit flip-flops that have been identified during loading the design
.SH Syntax \fBreportMultiBitFFs\fR  [-help]  [-flops]  [-latches]  [[[-info | -equiv | -usage] -all] | -cell <cell name>| -statistics | -notMergedInstList | -reasonNotMerged <unmerged_reason>]  [-outFile <file_name>]  
.P Reports all the multi-bit flip-flops that have been identified during loading the design. Use this command after all the libraries are loaded. You can choose to report information about either all the multi-bit flip-flops or one multi-bit flip-flop cell by specifying the name of the cell. The reported information can be printed on the console and written to a file. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each reportMultiBitFFs parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man reportMultiBitFFs.  "\fB-all\fR" Reports all the multi-bit flip-flops in the design. The parameters -all and -cell are mutually exclusive. If neither -all nor -cell is specified, the command considers -all by default and reports all the MBFFs in the design.  The parameters, -equiv, -info, and -usage are used along with the -all parameter. However, If none of these parameters are specified, the command will report all the information reported by the -info , -equiv , and -usage parameters.  When the setOptMode -opt_multi_bit_flop_reorder_bits parameter is set to true, power, or timing, a "Bit-strength (strong to weak)" column will also be added in the report.  Default: reportMultiBitFFs -all is used for reportMultiBitFFs.  "\fB-cell <cell_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the flip-flop for which information is to be reported. This parameter reports information, equivalence, and usage for the specified flip-flop. You can specify both single-bit and multi-bit flip flops for reporting this information.  When the setOptMode -opt_multi_bit_flop_reorder_bits parameter is set to true, power, or timing, a "Bit-strength (strong to weak)" column will also be added in the report.  "\fB-equiv\fR" Reports multi-bit flip-flop equivalence. This parameter is used along with the -all parameter. It reports all the equivalent multi-bit flip-flop cells and corresponding single-bit flip-flop cells in the design. The cells are reported in groups and ordered on size.  Note: The parameters, -equiv, -info, and -usage are mutually exclusive.  "\fB-flops\fR" When this parameter is specified, the software will report information about the flops. When no parameter is specified, reportMultiBitFFs command prints the information for both, latches and flops.  This parameter can be specified along with the following parameters:  reportMultiBitFFs -flops -all: Reports all multi-bit flops in the design.  reportMultiBitFFs -flops -equiv: Reports multi-bit flops equivalence.  reportMultiBitFFs -flops -usage: Reports all multi-bit flops usage.  reportMultiBitFFs -flops -info: Used along with -all. This parameter reports the properties of all the multi-bit flops in the design.  For example, Name, NumBits, Don't use/Don't touch, dimensions, scan type, Stateless Leakage, Stateless  Dynamic, and LibName.  reportMultiBitFFs -flops -cell: Specifies the name of the flop for which information is reported.  reportMultiBitFFs -flops -statistics: Reports the single-bit and multi-bit flop count in the current design.  "\fB-info\fR" This parameter is used along with the -all parameter. This parameter reports the following properties of all the multi-bit flip-flop cells in the design:   Name, NumBits, Don't Use/ Don't Touch, Dimensions, ScanType, Stateless Leakage, Stateless Dynamic, and LibName.  Note: The unit of the numbers reported in the "Dimensions" column is in terms of DB-unit (dbu). To convert it to um, use the following conversion:   set dimUm [expr $dimInDbU / [uu2dbu 1]]  When the setOptMode -opt_multi_bit_flop_reorder_bits parameter is set to true, power, or timing, a "Bit-strength (strong to weak)" column will also be added in the report.  "\fB-latches\fR" When specified, reports multi-bit latches in the design similar to the reporting of MBFFs. All other parameters work with this paramater just as they work with the flip-flops.  When this parameter is specified with the following parameters:
.RS  "*" 2 -all: Reports all the multi-bit latches in the design.  "*" 2 -cell <cell_name>: Specifies the name of the latch for which information is reported. You can specify both, single-bit and multi-bit latch for reporting this information.  "*" 2 -equiv: Reports multi-bit latch equivalence. This parameter is used along with the -all parameter. It reports all the equivalent multi-bit latch cells and corresponding single-bit latch cells in the design.  "*" 2 -info: This parameters is used along with the -all parameter. This parameter reports the following properties of all the multi-bit latch cells in the design:  Name, NumBites, Don't Use/ Don't Touch, Dimensions, ScanType, Stateless Leakage, Stateless Dynamic, and LibName  "*" 2 -outFile:Specifies the name of the output file for the latch information.  "*" 2 -statistics: Reports the single-bit and multi-bit latch count in the current design.  "*" 2 -usage: Reports the multi-bit latch usages. This parameter is used along with the -all parameter. This parameter reports the following usage of all the multi-bit latch cells in the design:  Name, NumBits, Count, Total Area, Total Leakage, Total Dynamic, and Min-Max Total Power Range
.RE   "\fB-notMergedInstList\fR" When specified, reports the number of unmerged instances.   "\fB-outFile <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file.   "\fB-reasonNotMerged {Partition CellEquivalent Constraint ScanConnection Location Timing Power User Legalization Bus All}\fR" Reports the instances that could not be merged for the specified reason. Specify any of the reasons in the argument or specify all to report all instances along with the reason why they could not be merged.  Partition: odd number of flops in one partition  CellEquivalent: no usable equivalent multi-bit flip-flop cell  Constraint: Constraints by sdc, rule, or user settings  ScanConnection: no scan connection to other flops in the same group  Location: too far away with other flops in the same group  Timing: exceed critical path threshold or MBFF merging that degrades timing  Power: all available multi-bit cells causing power degradation  User: user set to be excluded in flop merge  Legalization:  Bus: non-bus flops  All: all the reasons of not merged  "\fB-statistics\fR" Reports the single-bit and multi-bit flip flop count in the current design. An example of how the number is computed is shown below.  -------------------------------------------------  Current design flip-flop statistics  Single-Bit FF Count : 45573  Multi-Bit FF Count  : 29213  - 2-Bit FF Count    : 9068  - 4-Bit FF Count    : 4463  - 6-Bit FF Count    : 15682  Total Bit Count     : 175653  Total FF Count      : 74786  Bits Per Flop       : 2.349  -------------------------------------------------  The number is computed as below:  Total Bit Count = 45573 + 9068 * 2 + 4463 * 4 + 15682 * 6 = 175653  Total FF Count  = 45573 + 29213 = 74786  Bits Per Flop   = 175653 / 74786 = 2.349  "\fB-usage \fR" Reports the multi-bit flip-flop usage. This parameter is used along with the -all parameter. This parameter reports the following usage of all the multi-bit flip-flop cells in the design:   Name, NumBits, Count, Total Area, Total Leakage, Total Dynamic, and Min-Max Total Power Range.  Note: The last three columns of the report will be generated only when this command is called after running the report_power command.  Note: The unit of the numbers reported in the "Total area" column is in terms of DB-unit-square (dbu^2). To convert it to um^2, use the following conversion:   set areaUm [expr $areaInDbU / [uu2dbu 1] / [uu2dbu 1]]
