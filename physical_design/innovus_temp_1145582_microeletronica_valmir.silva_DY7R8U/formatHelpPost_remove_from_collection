.RS  "*" 2 The following commands create a collection of pins that does not include clock pins:   set allP [get_pins *]  set all_pin_no_clock [remove_from_collection $allP [get_pins -filter "is_clock == true"]]  You can use the sizeof_collection command to see that the all_pin_no_clock collection contains fewer objects (that is, no clock pins) than the original allP collection:  sizeof_collection $allP   50  sizeof_collection $all_pin_no_clock   47
