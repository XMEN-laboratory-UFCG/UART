.SH Name \fBgenerateVias\fR \-  Auto-generates vias required by nanoroute for the default and non-default rules (NDRs)
.SH Syntax \fBgenerateVias\fR  -help  [ -ndr_only ] 
.P Auto-generates vias required by nanoroute for the default and non-default rules (NDRs). The vias are based on the wire-widths of the routing-rule and are created to meet all the DRC via enclosure rules with variations for good pin-access, variations of double-cut vias for good double-cut via utilization, and min-area vias required for stacked-vias that have no route connected to meet the min-area metal rule.
.P The command only creates vias in the current Innovus session; they are not saved and restored for usage in a later Innovus session. So this command is normally only used for experimentation, or possibly if you just want temporary extra DFM vias to be used for this one session. If you want to save the vias for usage by nanoroute in later Innovus sessions, use setGenerateViaMode -auto true. The command is not set to "on" by default as setGenerateViaMode is set to false by default.
.P The command requires correct DRC rules (e.g. enclosure, spacing, minimum-cut, min-area rules, etc), and at least one LEF VIARULE GENERATE statement (or OpenAccess standardViaDef) for every via layer used for routing (as required by OpenAccess). The cut enclosure values in the VIARULE GENERATE statement are not used except for old LEF technology files (LEF version 5.5 and older) that have no enclosure rules (this is not recommended usage, but is kept for backward compatability). The VIARULE cut-spacing values are ignored-only the DRC cut-spacing values are used.
.P No predefined vias are required (e.g LEF VIA DEFAULT, or NONDEFAULTRULE USEVIA or an OpenAccess validVias list for any routing ConstraintGroup are not needed).
.P Any predefined vias that do exist, are kept unless -deleteViaBeforeGenerate is used (see below).  Generated vias are compared to predefined vias and if they are geometrically identical, that specific generated via is not kept so no duplicate vias are created.
.P Note: NDRs that have the same widths as the default rule will inherit the same vias, including any pre-defined vias.

.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each generateVias parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:    man generateVias.  "\fB-ndr_only\fR" Specifies vias generation for non-default rules only.  When specified, it generates signal routing vias for all NDR (non-default rules) and skips generating via for default rule.  It is always used for designs having full set of default rule vias, but not sufficient non-default rule vias.  Example    generateVias -ndr_only  This generates vias for all NDRs, including the NDRs created by add_ndr or createNdr commands.  You must use setGenerateViaMode -auto true -ndr_only true in the Innovus flow. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 generateVias   Will add auto-generated vias to any existing vias for all routing rules.

.SH See also:
.RS  "*" 2 dumpOutVias to write out the vias and look at them.  "*" 2 setGenerateViaMode to generate vias persistently for multiple Innovus sessions.
