.SH Name \fBall_instances\fR
.SH Syntax \fBall_instances\fR  [-help]  <object>  [-hierarchical] 
.P Returns a collection of all instances available in a design, or all instances of a specified library cell existing in the current design.
.P You cannot use the all_instances command on the top level of the design (all_instances [get_design top]).
.P However, you can use the command for hierarchical modules inside the top level. For example, if SUB is a hierarchical module in the top level of the design, you can specify the following command to return all instances of that module: all_instances [get_design SUB]. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-hierarchical\fR" Specifies that the patterns should be matched hierarchically. If the hierarchical name of an instance at a particular hierarchical level matches the patterns, it is included in the result.  "\fB<object>\fR" Specifies the name of a design or a library cell in the current design. You can specify a pattern for the design or library cell name, or a single collection of a design or library cell.
