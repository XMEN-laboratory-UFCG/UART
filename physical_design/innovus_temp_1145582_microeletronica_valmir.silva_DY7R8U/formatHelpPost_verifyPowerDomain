.SH Name \fBverifyPowerDomain\fR \-  Verifies whether the power domains are set up correctly in terms of timing library binding and PG connection
.SH Syntax \fBverifyPowerDomain\fR  [-help]  [-allInstInPD]  [-aobBiasConn]  [-aoBufferType]  [-bind]  [-cell_bind {<cell
...>}]  [-drcFile <string>]  [-gconn [<module_name_list>]]  [-isoNetPD [<fileName>]  [-libBindingVoltage]  [-noFTermIsoC]  [-noFTermShifter]   [-place [-place_rpt <report_name>]]  [-powerSwitch]  [-pwrWithinMinGap]  [-retention {<fileName
...>}]  [-xNetPD {<fileName>}] 
.P Verifies whether the power domains are set up correctly in terms of timing library binding and PG connection. This command also checks whether any power domains overlap. The verifyPowerDomain command checks that libraries specified for each power domain of each dc_corner are complete for each power domain member list. The command also checks if the inserted isolation is consistent with the isolation rule. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each verifyPowerDomain parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man verifyPowerDomain.  "\fB-allInstInPD\fR" Verifies all instances are in the power domain.  "\fB-aobBiasConn\fR" Checks the AOB bias net connection.   "\fB-aoBufferType\fR" Checks if the AO buffer in each domain has correct type in terms of AO Nwell design and IEEE1801 Nwell specification.  "\fB-bind\fR" Verifies that all cells are bound to correct timing library cells.  "\fB-cell_bind {<cell
...>}\fR" Checks if the specified cells are bound in the domain's library set for all active views and domains.   "\fB-drcFile <string>\fR" Creates DRC violation markers and save those in the specified file.   "\fB-gconn <module_name_list>\fR" Verifies that power and ground pins of instances within the power domain are connected to the power and ground nets of that power domain. In addition, this parameter verifies that the tie-high and tie-low connections of an instance are connected to the same power and ground nets of the power domain to which the cell belongs. If you do not specify a list of module names, all modules are verified.  "\fB-isoNetPD\fR" Verifies if the nets are missing isolation instances according to the power intent file. It also checks if the isolation uses right type of cell specified in the IEEE1801 map_isolation_cell command (if any).  "\fB-libBindingVoltage\fR" Checks voltage against the binding library.   "\fB-noFTermIsoC\fR" Ignores the nets connecting to I/O when verifying isolation using -isoNetPD.  "\fB-noFTermShifter\fR" Ignores the nets connecting to I/O when verifying shifter using -xNetPD.  "\fB-place\fR" Verifies if the instances are placed in the boundary of their power domain.  "\fB-place_rpt <report_name>\fR" Specifies a name and location for the report generated when you use this command with the -place parameter.  "\fB-powerSwitch\fR" Verifies whether each row in the power domains contain at least one power switch. The command issues a warning message detailing which rows do not contain at least one switch. It also checks if the power switch uses right type of cell specified in the IEEE1801 map_power_switch_cell command (if any).  "\fB-pwrWithinMinGap\fR" Verifies that the power domain ring is within the distance specified by the modifyPowerDomainAttr -minGaps or createPowerDomain -minGaps command.  "\fB-retention {<fileName
...>}\fR" Specifies a name for storing the verify retention information. It checks if the retention uses the right type of cell specified in the IEEE1801 map_retention_cell command (if any).  "\fB-xNetPD\fR" Verifies if the nets are missing level shifter according to the power intent file. It also checks if the level shifter uses right type of cell specified in the IEEE1801 map_level_shifter_cell command (if any). 
.SH Examples
.P The following command issues warning messages if instances that are not members of a power domain are placed within that power domain boundary, or if any power domains overlap:
.P verifyPowerDomain -place
