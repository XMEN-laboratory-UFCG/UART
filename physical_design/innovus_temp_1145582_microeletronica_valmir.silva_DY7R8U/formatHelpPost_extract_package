.SH Name \fBextract_package\fR
.SH Syntax  \fBextract_package\fR  [-help] <<domain>>  [-output <<directoryname>>]  -pkg_bga_name <<bga_circuitname>>   -pkg_die_name <<die_circuitname>>  [-reference_net <<netname>>]  [-spd_file <filename>]    -workspace <<workspace_name>> 
.P Specifies to start package model extraction.
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.  "\fB<domain>\fR" Specifies the rail analysis domain name.   "\fB-output <<directoryname>> \fR" By default, the package model will be created in the workspace. However, if you specify an output directory, then a copy of the result will be made in the new directory.  "\fB-pkg_bga_name <<bga_circuitname>> \fR" Defines the ball grid array (BGA) circuit name in the package model. It is the PCB component in the package model, which eventually connects to the PCB model.  "\fB-pkg_die_name <<die_circuitname>>\fR" Defines the die circuit name in the package model. When specified, the software automatically creates a mapping between the die name in the package extraction tool and the die name in the software.   "\fB-reference_net <<netname>>\fR" Specifies the ground net that is selected as reference net for pin-based model generation. This is the ground net that is being referred to by the power nets.   "\fB-spd_file <filename>\fR" Specifies an existing Sigrity
.spd file for package extraction. This parameter allows you to specify a
.spd file instead of the workspace name (package model database) of the package extraction tool (XtractIM).   "\fB-workspace <<workspace_name>>\fR" Specifies the workspace name (package model database) of the package extraction tool (XtractIM). The file name extension is
.ximx. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following example specifies the package models details and starts extraction:  extract_package ALL \\    -workspace
../rak_xim_pkg_model/C1_Voltus_4L.ximx \\    -pkg_bga_name FPBGA144 \\    -pkg_die_name CD1 \\    -output rak_xim_pkg_model_voltus_cpf \\    -reference_net VSS
