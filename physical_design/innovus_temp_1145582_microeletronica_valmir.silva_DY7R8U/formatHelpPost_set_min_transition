.TH set_min_transition  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_min_transition\fR
.SH Syntax \fBset_min_transition\fR  [-help]  <transition_limit>  <object_list>  [-clock_path]  [-data_path]  [-fall]   [-override]  [-rise] 
.P Sets the minimum slew time limit (transition) on the specified ports of the top timing module and/or clock waveforms.
.P When set on a port, the slew time at the port must be greater than or equal to the specified limit. When set on a module, the limit applies to all the pins in the module and its ports if the module is the top timing module. The minimum transition limits on pins can come from library objects, which are the default minimum transition of the libraries or minimum transition on library cell pins. In this case, the most constraining limit, which is the largest, will apply on pins and ports.
.P Use the report_ports -type slew_limit command to view the minimum transition limits set on ports of the top timing module.
.P When limits are set on a clock waveform, you can use -clock_path, -data_path, -rise, and -fall parameters to provide more specifications.
.P The set_min_transition constraint on clock objects will be honored only by the report_constraint command for DRV violations. The constraint will not be used in optimizations. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-clock_path\fR" Specifies all pins that are in the network of the specific clocks in the object list.  "\fB-data_path\fR" Specifies all pins that are in the data paths launched by the specific clocks in the object list.  "\fB-fall\fR" Specifies falling transition.  "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the list of objects - ports, instance pins, library cell pins, modules, and/or clock waveforms.  "\fB-override\fR" Overrides the minimum transition limit from other sources, such as, library or constraints.  This parameter can be used to force a specific constraint value for a specified list of instance pins/port/library cell pins - this overrides the maximum/minimum values set prior to this setting.  To enable this feature, make the following setting:  set timing_constraint_enable_drv_limit_override true  "\fB-rise\fR" Specifies rising transition for all selected pins.  "\fB<transition_limit>\fR" Specifies the value of the minimum slew time limit (minimum transition). This value must be less than or equal to zero. The minimum slew time limit is in time units from the target technology library. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following example sets a minimum transition limit of 0.9 units on all the ports of the top timing module, and a minimum transition limit of 0.7 units on the top timing module:   set_min_transition 0.9 [get_ports *]   set_min_transition 0.7 [current_design]   The minimum limit that applies to ports is 0.9, which is the most constraining value.
