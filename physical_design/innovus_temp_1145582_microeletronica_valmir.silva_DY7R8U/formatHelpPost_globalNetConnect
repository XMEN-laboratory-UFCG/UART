.P The globalNetConnect command connects PG pins or 1'b0/1'b1 pins to the specified global net, which is either a power or ground net. You can use the command in the following three scenarios:
.RS  "*" 2 Connecting pins in a single instance.  "*" 2 Connecting pins in multiple instances.  "*" 2 Moving connections on a net to the specified global net, which is typically higher in the design hierarchy.
.RE   Note: Use the following command to report global nets of the complete design:writeFplanScript -sections {globalNetConnect}
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each globalNetConnect parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:   man globalNetConnect  "\fB-all\fR" Applies the global net connection to all instances in the design.  "\fB-autoTie\fR" Support supply/ground sensitivity. In a command for PG-pin connections, the option can only be specified together with -type pgpin.  In addition to connecting power pin VDD to global net VDD for each instance, all the instance tie-high pins whose related power pin (as specified in CPF,
.lib, or LEF) is VDD, will automatically be tied to global net VDD. For example,  globalNetConnect VDD -type pgpin -pin VDD -autoTie   "\fB-disconnect\fR" Disconnect p/g net connection. The option works only with -sinst, -type pgpin and -pin options.  Note: This option is mutually exclusive with globalNetName argument.  "\fB<globalNetName>  \fR" Specifies the name of the global net to which the specified pins are connected.  "\fB-hierarchicalInstance <hierInstName>\fR" Applies the global net connection to instances under <hierInstName>. Only the pins of the instances or the local nets under the specified module or hierarchical instance are connected.  This parameter is mutually exclusive with the -region parameter.  Note: You can also use the following spelling variations for this argument:
.RS  "*" 2 -hierInst
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 -module
.RE   "\fB-instanceBasename <instBasenamePattern>\fR" Specifies the names of leaf instances for which pins are to be connected to the global net. You can use the wildcard (*) character to specify a pattern of instance basenames. An instance basename cannot contain the "/" character. This parameter is used in conjunction with the -type pgpin parameter, or with the -type tiehi or -type tielo parameters.  Note: You can also use the -instBasename spelling variations for this argument.  "\fB-net <netBaseName>\fR" Specifies the basenames of nets to connect to the global net. Use the wildcard (*) character to specify a pattern of net basenames. A net basename cannot contain the "/" character. This parameter is used in conjunction with the -type net parameter.  Note: When this parameter is used without the -hierarchicalInstance parameter, the globalNetConnect command uses the top hinst (top Verilog module), by default.  "\fB-netlistOverride\fR" Overrides previous global net connections. The option is similar to the option -override. However, in addition to overriding previous global net connections, -netlistOverride also overrides netlist-specified P/G-pin connections if applicable, which the option -override can't do.  "\fB-nonHierarchical\fR" Connections are made only for instances in the specified hierarchical instance, and not those in its descendant hierarchical instances. The option is of type boolean and is optional.  "\fB-override\fR" Specifies that the values that used with the globalNetConnect command override global net connection values that have been set previously.  "\fB-pin <pinNamePattern>\fR" Specifies the pins to connect to the global net. You can use the wildcard (*) character to specify a pattern of pin names. This parameter is used in conjunction with the -type pgpin parameter, or optionally with the -type tiehi or -type  tielo parameters.  "\fB-powerDomain <powerDomainName>\fR" Applies the global net connection to instances within the specified power domain.  "\fB-region <llx lly urx ury>\fR" Applies the global net connection to instances inside the specified region. The region is specified by the x and y coordinates of the lower left and upper right boundary. This parameter is mutually exclusive with the -module parameter.  "\fB-singleInstance <instName>\fR" Connects pins in a single instance to a global net. <->singleInstance is the instance's complete hierarchical name, without any wildcard characters.  Note: You can also use the following spelling variations for this argument:
.RS  "*" 2 -sinst
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 -singleInst
.RE   "\fB-type {net | pgpin | tielo | tiehi}\fR" Specifies the type of connection to be made to the global net. Use one of the following values:
.RS  "*" 2 net: Specifies that the pins connected to nets listed with the -net parameter are to be moved to the specified global net.  "*" 2 pgpin: Specifies that the power and ground pins listed with the -pin parameter are to be connected.  "*" 2 tielo: Specifies that tie low (1'b0) pins be connected. Before tielo net is assigned, no actual net is connected to the tie low pin.  "*" 2 tiehi: Specifies that tie high (1'b1) pins be connected. Before tiehi net is assigned, no actual net is connected to the tie high pin.
.RE   "\fB-verbose \fR" Specifies that connection statistics and warning messages are displayed in the console. This parameter can be useful during troubleshooting. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command connects the VSS pin of all instances to VSS:  globalNetConnect VSS -type pgpin -pin VSS  "*" 2 The following command moves all vdd! connections under u1/u2 to VDD:  globalNetConnect VDD -type net -hierInst u1/u2 -net vdd!  Note: You can also ignore polarity checking during globalNetConnect and CPF/IEEE1801 operations through the global variable init_ignore_pgpin_polarity_check that allows USE POWER pin to be connected to a USE GROUND net (or vice versa).  "*" 2 The following example shows how the power and ground nets are defined in the
.globals file, and while importing the design data, the same
.globals file is loaded:  set init_pwr_net {VDD PWRD PWRA PWRIO}  set init_gnd_net {VSS GNDD GNDA GNDIO}  "*" 2 The following example presents how to remove all the power and ground net connections from the Innovus database:  clearGlobalNets  # For instances or standard cells where LEF pin name is vdd! for power and gnd! for ground, the net names VDD and GND should have been already defined as power and ground net.  globalNetConnect VDD -type pgpin -pin vdd! -all  globalNetConnect GND -type pgpin -pin gnd! -all  # For tie pin connections to power and ground, the net names VDD and VSS should have been already defined as power and ground nets.In below case, tiehi/tielo pins are directly assigned to the VDD/VSS nets.  globalNetConnect VDD -type tiehi  globalNetConnect VSS -type tielo  Note: The addTieHiLo command overrides the above direct connection.  # For macro single instance U1/rom1 as example making power and ground pin connections to power and ground net, the net names PWRD GNDD PWRA and GNDA should have been already defined as power and ground nets.  globalNetConnect PWRD -type pgpin -pin DIGPWR -sinst U1/rom1 -override  globalNetConnect GNDD -type pgpin -pin DIGGRND -sinst U1/rom1 -override  globalNetConnect GNDA -type pgpin -pin AGND -sinst U1/rom1 -override  globalNetConnect PWRA -type pgpin -pin AVDD -sinst U1/rom1 -override  globalNetConnect GNDA -type pgpin -pin AVSS -sinst U1/rom1 -override  # For IO PAD single instance iopad_ring/RT5 making power and ground pin connections to power and ground net, the net names PWRD GNDD PWRIO and GNDIO should have been already defined as power and ground nets.  globalNetConnect PWRD -type pgpin -pin VDD -sinst iopad_ring/RT5 -override  globalNetConnect GNDD -type pgpin -pin VSS -sinst iopad_ring/RT5 -override  globalNetConnect PWRIO -type pgpin -pin VDDIO -sinst iopad_ring/RT5 -override  globalNetConnect GNDIO -type pgpin -pin VSSIO -sinst iopad_ring/RT5 -override  "*" 2 The following example presents how to disconnect and reconnect the existing glbalNetConnection for specific instances (such as eng/ext_mgnt/dram1_sram/s1ram/sram_100 and eng/ext_mgmt/vpp_sram/sram/sram_070):  globalNetConnect -disconnect -pin VDD -type pgpin -singleInstance eng/ext_mgnt/dram1_sram/s1ram/sram_100  globalNetConnect VDD_BLOCK -pin VDD -type pgpin -singleInstance engine/ext_mgnt/dram1_sram/s1ram/sram_100  globalNetConnect -disconnect -pin VDD -type pgpin -singleInstance eng/ext_mgmt/vpp_sram/sram/sram_070  globalNetConnect VDD_BLOCK -pin VDD -type pgpin -singleInstance eng/ext_mgmt/vpp_sram/sram/sram_070  "*" 2 The following commands connect VDD pins of instances that match Module_LVT/p* to VDDL, VDD pins of instances that match Module_HVT/r* to VDDH, and VDD pins of instances that match Module_RVT/* to VDDR. (note that it is needed to specify hierarchical instance name to -module, and not module name):  globalNetConnect VDDL -type pgpin -pin VDD -instBasename p* -module Module_LVT -verbose  globalNetConnect VDDH -type pgpin -pin VDD -instinstBasename r* -module Module_HVT -verbose  globalNetConnect VDDR -type pgpin -pin VDD -module Module_RVT -verbose
