.SH Name \fBdeleteBNet\fR \-  Given a bussed net or a single bit of a bussed net, logically removes the entire bussed net from a design
.SH Syntax \fBdeleteBNet\fR  [-help]   [-moduleBased <moduleName>]   {-bus busName | -busFromBit <busBitName>}
.P Given a bussed net or a single bit of a bussed net, logically removes the entire bussed net from a design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each deleteBNet.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man deleteBNet  "\fB-moduleBased <moduleName>\fR" Specifies the module name that contains the bus net which needs to be deleted.  This parameter is optional.   "\fB-bus <busName>\fR" Specifies the base name of the top-level bus net, or the base name of a bus net in verilog module when used with -moduleBased option   "\fB-busFromBit <busBitName>\fR" Specifies the bus bit name of a top level or a non-top level bus net, or a bus bit name of a bus net in verilog module when used together with the -moduleBased option.   Note: The deleteBNet command does not support wildcards.  It is not possible to delete a single bit of a bussed net. To change the bus width of an existing net, the net needs to be deleted and re-created with addNet.
