.SH Name \fBtiming_enable_power_ground_constants\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_enable_power_ground_constants\fR  {true | false}  
.P Default: false
.P Determines if case analysis is inferred from power and ground rail connections/nets, e.g., VDD and GND.
.P When set to true, the software recognizes the constants that come from power and ground rail connections.
.P When set to false, the software ignores these constants. This provides the most intuitive behavior with logical style netlist (and other tools that do not read physical data). 
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
