.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_clock_tree_nets\fR \-  This command returns a list of clock tree nets whose names match the specified pattern
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_clock_tree_nets\fR   [-help]  <pattern>   [-in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>]  [-net_types leaf | trunk | top]  [-not_in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>]   [-regexp]
.P This command returns a list of clock tree nets whose names match the specified pattern. By default, the command returns all clock tree nets with matching names, but you can use optional parameters to filter the list based on net type and clock tree membership. Valid values for net types are leaf, trunk, and top. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_ccopt_clock_tree_nets parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man get_ccopt_clock_tree_nets.   "\fB-in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>          \fR" Specifies a TCL list of clock trees whose nets are to be included in the list. If not specified, all the nets of all the clock trees in the design that satisfy the other conditions of the command will be returned.  "\fB-net_types leaf | trunk | top\fR" Only returns nets of the specified type(s). All clock tree nets fall into one of three categories:
.RS  "*" 2 leaf nets - nets connected to sinks  "*" 2 top nets - nets with a high transitive fanout, exceeding the threshold specified using the set_ccopt_property routing_top_min_fanout CCOpt property  "*" 2 trunk nets - all other nets in the clock tree that are neither leaf nor top nets
.RE   By default, all net types are returned: leaf, top, and trunk.  "\fB-not_in_clock_trees <list_of_trees>\fR" Specifies a TCL list of clock trees whose nets are to be excluded from the list. If not specified, all the nets that satisfy the other conditions of the command will be returned.   "\fB<pattern>\fR" Returns clock tree nets that match this pattern. If not specified, all the nets that satisfy the other conditions of the command will be returned.   "\fB-regexp\fR" When specified, treats all patterns as full TCL regular expressions. If not specified, pattern is treated as a wildcard pattern.
