.SH Name \fBcreateRow\fR \-  Creates rows for the specified site
.SH Syntax \fBcreateRow\fR   [-help]  -site <siteName>  [-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>} | -boxList {{<x1 y1>} {<x2 y2>} <...>}<>| -polygon {{<x1 y1>} {<x2 y2>}...}]   [-spacing <distance>]  [-limitInCore]  [-noAbut | -noAbut1st]   [-flip1st]  [-noCheck]    [-noFlip] 
.P Creates rows for the specified site. The row boundary can be defined by core area or the area that you specify. This command supports the creation of overlapping rows. This command can create only horizontal rows. By default, alternate rows are flipped and all rows are abutted (no spaces between rows). 
.P The following points apply to the usage of this command:
.RS  "*" 2 Rows can be created both inside and outside the core area, but within the die.  "*" 2 All new rows created in an area must be an integer multiple of any existing rows in the same area.  "*" 2 Non-integer multiple height rows cannot be created outside power domains.
.RE
.P Use this command after importing a design. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Create rows in the specified rectangle. (Default is within the core box.) The values are floats, units are microns. Rows are truncated at the die box boundary. Either a tcl list or 4 separate parameters works.
.RS  "*" 2 <x1>: Specifies the lower left x coordinate of the area.  "*" 2 y1: Specifies the lower left y coordinate of the area.  "*" 2 x2: Specifies the upper right x coordinate of the area.  "*" 2 y2: Specifies the upper right y coordinate of the area.
.RE   Data_type: box, optional  "\fB-boxList {{<x1 y1>} {<x2 y2>}
...}\fR" The X and Y values are floats, units are microns. There must be an even number of points specified. Pairs of points are used to determine a set of rectangles, where the first point of the pair is LLX, LLY, the second point is URX, URY. Rectangles need not be overlapping. Rows are created in the union of the rectangles defined. Note that for overlapping rectangles, rows are created continuously starting at the first (bottom) row (of the lowest rectangle). For non-overlapping rectangles, rows are created independently starting at the bottom of each rectangle.  Data_type: point_list, optional  "\fB-flip1st\fR" Controls the orientation of the first (bottom) row, which is R0 by default. When -flip1st, the first row's orientation is MX. See -noFlip.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each createRow parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man createRow  "\fB-limitInCore\fR" By default (none of -area, -polygon, -boxList specified) rows are created in the core box. When one of -area, -polygon, -boxList is specified, by default rows are created within the intersection of the die box and the specified rectilinear shape. When one of -area, -polygon, -boxList and -limitInCore is specified, rows are created within the intersection of the core box and the specified rectilinear shape.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noAbut\fR" Controls where spaces are inserted between rows. By default, spaces are inserted between pairs of rows. When -noAbut is enabled spaces are inserted between every row. See -spacing and -noAbut1st.  Default: The rows are abutted by default.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noAbut1st\fR" Controls where the first space between rows is inserted. Default is that the first space is inserted after the first (lowest) pair of rows, and subsequently after every pair of rows (space inserted between 2nd and 3rd rows, between 4th and 5th rows, etc). When -noAbut1st, the first space is inserted after the first (lowest) row, and subsequently after every pair of rows (space inserted between 1st and 2nd rows, then 3rd and 4th rows, etc). See -spacing and -noAbut.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noCheck\fR" Specifies that  the row should not be aligned to the existing row and should support redo undo.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-noFlip\fR" By default rows have alternating orientation (...MX R0 MX R0...), or when -no_flip_rows is specified rows have identical orientation (one of:
...R0 R0 R0...; or
...MX MX MX...). See -flip1st.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-polygon {{<x1 y1>} {<x2 y2>}...}\fR" The X and Y values are floats, units are microns. There must be an even number of points specified. The points specify a polygon in which rows are created. Each pair of points specifies one edge of the polygon, so { X1 Y1 } and { X2 Y2 } specify one edge, { X2 Y2 } { X3 Y3 } specify the next edge, etc. The last edge is specified by { Xlast Ylast } { X1 Y1 }. In the degenerate case (multiple rectilinear areas touching at corners) rows will be created continuously starting at the lowest point.  Data_type: point_list, optional  "\fB-site <siteName>\fR" Specifies the name of the site to be used for creating the rows. (Objects not allowed.)  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-spacing \fR" Specifies the width of the space inserted between certain rows. The first (lowest) row is always inserted along the bottom edge of the area having rows added. If -noAbut is specified, then space is inserted between every subsequent row. The default is space is inserted between every other row. If -noAbut1st is specified, then space is inserted after the first row (and then the third etc). The default is that space is inserted after the second row (and then the 4th etc). Note that -noAbut and -noAbut1st are mutually exclusive.  Default: 0.0 um  Data_type: float, optional
