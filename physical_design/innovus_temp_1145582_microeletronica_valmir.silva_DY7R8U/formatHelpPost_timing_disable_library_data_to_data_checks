.TH timing_disable_library_data_to_data_checks  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtiming_disable_library_data_to_data_checks\fR \-  When set to true, this global disables data-to-data checks that are coded in the library as non-sequential timing checks
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_disable_library_data_to_data_checks\fR  {true | false}   Default: false 
.P When set to true, this global disables data-to-data checks that are coded in the library as non-sequential timing checks. Data-to-data checks are distinguished from other non-sequential timing checks because both the reference pin and constrained pin side of the timing check are data pins rather than clock pins. You should use the timing_disable_non_sequential_checks global to control other types of non-sequential checks where the reference pin is a clock pin.
.P To set this global variable, use the set_global command.
