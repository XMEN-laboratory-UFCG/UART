.SH Name \fBfindPinPortNumber\fR \-  Determines suitable ports available for a bump
.SH Syntax  \fBfindPinPortNumber\fR  [-help]   [-area <x1 y1 x2 y2>]  [-bumps <bump_list>]  [-geometry_height {<min> [<max>]}]  [-geometry_width {<min> [<max>]}]  [-layer <string>]   [-selected]    [-cellName  <cell_name>  | -instName  <instance_name> ]    {-pinName  <pin_name>  | -netName  <net_name> }
.P Determines suitable ports available for a bump. The command has the following functions:
.RS  "*" 2 Check if the IO pad has a standard LEF definition.  "*" 2 Suggest suitable ports for flip chip routing on the specified instance based on the pin name or nets in a specified area.   "*" 2 Filter ports by layer, geometry size, and area. Only the ports that match the specified filter rules are returned by findPinPortNumber.  "*" 2 Consider routing between bumps and ports to return the combinations of {bump:inst:pin:port} if the bumps for which ports are to be found are specified.

.P findPinPortNumber returns a port number string list. You can use set result  [findPinPortNumber] or catch {findPinPortNumber} result to get the result.
.P The following commands provide additional support for the port numbering feature. Use these commands to add, edit, and delete bump properties easily:

.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each findPinPortNumber parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man findPinPortNumber  "\fB-area <x1 y1 x2 y2>\fR" Specifies the area in which the command will be used. findPInPortNumber returns port numbers overlapping with the specified area.  "\fB-bumps <bump_list>\fR" Finds suitable ports for the specified bumps based on the smallest distance.  This option supports only 1:1 pairing between ports and bumps. Therefore, if the number of ports is different from the number of bumps, pairing is based on the smaller number.  findPinPortNumber allows empty bumps or bumps assigned to the same net as the pin. If the assigned net is different from the net with which the pin is connected, findPinPortNumber issues an error message and quits.  "\fB-cellName <cell_name>\fR" Finds the pin port number of the instance of the specified cell. Wild cards are supported in <cell_name>.  "\fB-geometry_height {<min> [<max>]}\fR" Specifies the minimum and maximum values for the height of the target port's geometry. If you specify only one value, the height is taken as equal to the specified value. Only ports that match the specified height criterion are returned by findPinPortNumber.  "\fB-geometry_width {<min> [<max>]}\fR" Specifies the minimum and maximum values of the width of the target port's geometry. If you specify only one value, the width is taken as equal to the specified value. Only ports that match the specified width criterion are returned  by findPinPortNumber.  "\fB-instName <instance_name>\fR" Finds pin port number of the specified instance. Wild cards are supported in <instance_name>.  "\fB-layer <string>\fR" Filters target ports by layer. If you specify this parameter, only ports on the specified layer are returned. You can specify either layer name or layer ID, such as M8.  "\fB-pinName <pin_name> | -netName <net_name>\fR" Finds the port number on the specified pin or on the pin connected to the specified net.  "\fB-selected\fR" Finds suitable ports for the selected instance and bumps:
.RS  "*" 2 If only bumps are selected, findPinPortNumber first finds the ports satisfying the specified filtering rules and then considers the routing between these ports and the selected bumps.  "*" 2 If only IO instances are selected:
.RS  "*" 2 If only one IO instance is selected, findPinPortNumber finds the ports satisfying the specified filtering rules.  "*" 2 If more than one IO instance is selected, findPinPortNumber issues an error message stating that only a single IO instance is supported for this option and then quit.

.RS  "*" 2 If both IO instances and bumps are selected:
.RS  "*" 2 If only one IO instance is selected, findPinPortNumber first finds the ports satisfying the specified filtering rules and then considers the routing between these ports and the selected bumps.   "*" 2 If more than one IO instance is selected, findPinPortNumber issues an error message stating that only a single IO instance is supported for this option and then quit.

.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command suggests port numbers on instances named IOPADS_INST/esd* for the pins connected to net VDD.   findPinPortNumber -instName IOPADS_INST/esd* -netName VDD  The tool returns a list of suitable port numbers as follows:  IOPADS_INST/esd:VDD:1 IOPADS_INST/esd1:VDD:1   "*" 2 The diagram below depicts an IO instance padring/inst1 with three ports for PIN PADVDDE on the same layer and with the same size. The bumps Bump_1, Bump_2, Bump_3, and Bump_4 are empty.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.RS  "*" 2 The following command finds ports of the pin PADVDDE on the instance padring/inst1 that meet the specified area constraint:   findPinPortNumber -instName padring/inst1 -pinName PADVDDE -area "50 100 300 250"  For the instance depicted in the diagram above, the command returns {padring/inst1:PADVDDE:1}.  "*" 2  The following command finds ports of the pin PADVDDE on the instance padring/inst1 that meet the specified area constraint:   findPinPortNumber -instName padring/inst1 -pinName PADVDDE -area 550 120 650 350  For the instance depicted, the command returns {padring/inst1:PADVDDE:2 padring/inst1:PADVDDE:3}. Both port2 and port3 are returned as they overlap with the specified area constraint.  "*" 2 The following command finds suitable ports of the pin PADVDDE on the instance padring/inst1 for the specified bump:  findPinPortNumber -instName padring/inst1 -pinName PADVDDE -bumps Bump_2   For the instance depicted, the command returns {Bump_2:padring/inst1:PADVDDE:2}.  "*" 2 The following command finds suitable ports of the pin PADVDDE on the instance padring/inst1 for the specified bumps:  findPinPortNumber -instName padring/inst1 -pinName PADVDDE -bumps {Bump_1 Bump_2 Bump_3 Bump_4}   For the instance depicted, the command returns {Bump_1:padring/inst1:PADVDDE:1 Bump_2:padring/inst1:PADVDDE:2 Bump_3:padring/inst1:PADVDDE:3}.
