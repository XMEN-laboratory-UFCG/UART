.SH Name \fBget_physical_info\fR \-  Gets the physical connection or routing path between IO pads and bumps
.SH Syntax \fBget_physical_info\fR   [-help]  {-object <string> | -selected }  [-highlight]  [-shapes {RING STRIPE FOLLOWPIN IOWIRE COREWIRE BLOCKWIRE PADRING BLOCKRING FILLWIRE FILLWIREOPC DRCFILL None}]  [-subclass {<subclass_name_list>}]  [-type {connection | routing_path}] 
.P Gets the physical connection or routing path between IO pads and bumps. For example, you can select a bump or specify bump name to get information about connected IO pad. Alternatively, you can select or specify an IO pad and get information about connected bumps. You can specify IO pads by pad name, instance:pin combination, or instance:pin:port combination.
.P Use this command to check connections after RDL routing, either manual or through fcroute. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_physical_info parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man get_physical_info  "\fB-highlight\fR" Highlights the routing path.   "\fB-object <string>\fR" Specifies the object from which to get the physical information. For bump, specify the complete bump name.For IO pad, specify one of the following:
.RS  "*" 2 instance_name  "*" 2 instance_name:pin_name  "*" 2 instance_name:pin_name:port_number
.RE   "\fB-selected\fR" Gets the physical information for the selected object.    "\fB-subclass {<subclass_name_list>}\fR" Specifies the subclass name of the wires and vias to be checked. You can specify multiple subclass names enclosed in braces. You can also use wildcards while specifying subclass names.   "\fB-shapes {RING STRIPE FOLLOWPIN IOWIRE COREWIRE BLOCKWIRE PADRING BLOCKRING FILLWIRE FILLWIREOPC DRCFILL None}]\fR" Specifies the shapes of the wires and vias to be checked. The default value is IOWIRE.   "\fB-type {connection | routing_path}\fR" Specifies the type of the physical information to return. The default type is connection.
.RS  "*" 2 connection: Returns the objects that are physically connected to the object you have specified or selected. For example, if you have selected an IO pad, it returns the names of the bump that are connected with the IO pad. If you have selected or specified a bump, it returns the IO pads connected to the bump, using the format ioInst:pin:port.   "*" 2 routing_path: Returns the pointer list of the wires and vias that are physically connected to the object you have selected or specified.

.SH Examples
.P Consider the following design.
.P (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
.P For this design, get_physical_info reports information as follows:
.RS  "*" 2  get_physical_info -object {IOpad_1:vdd:1}  Returns {Bump_1}  "*" 2 get_physical_info  -type connection -object {Bump_1}  Returns {IOpad_1:vdd:1 IOpad_2:vdd:2  Bump_2}  "*" 2 get_physical_info -object {Bump_1} -subclass B  Returns {IOpad_1:vdd:1 IOpad_2:vdd:2}  "*" 2  get_physical_info -type routing_path -object {Bump_2}  Returns {0x2aaaba6c0ab0 0x2aaaba6c0b40 0x2aaaba6c0b70}
