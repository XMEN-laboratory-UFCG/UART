.SH Name \fBtiming_extract_model_exhaustive_validation_mode\fR
.SH Syntax \fBtiming_extract_model_exhaustive_validation_mode\fR  {true | false} 
.P Default: false
.P Enables extracted timing model (ETM) validation at the minimum and maximum indices of the slew load indices.
.P When set to false, the ETM validation is done only for the input slews/output-loads that have been asserted on the design during timing model extraction. 
.P When set to true, the software uses the Extremity-Validation (EV-ETM) methodology that allows ETM to model the timing arcs in the design for a range of discrete input slews/output-loads, thus providing a more comprehensive validation.
.P To set this global variable, use the set command.
