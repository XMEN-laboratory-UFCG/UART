.SH Name \fBset_default_view\fR \-  Temporarily changes the default active analysis view to a different active view
.SH Syntax  \fBset_default_view\fR  {-setup <newDefaultSetupView> | -hold <newDefaultHoldView>}  
.P Temporarily changes the default active analysis view to a different active view.
.P Some Innovus applications can function only on a single analysis view at a time. By default, these single-view applications use the default analysis view. If an application or flow step does not provide a native option for specifying which view to use, the set_default_view command can be used to temporarily change the default view to a different active view that is better suited to that flow step.
.P Note: Using the set_default_view command does not affect software performance because it only uses views that are already active in the design. If you use the set_analysis_view command to change the default views, the existing timing, delay calculation, and RC data is reset.
.P Use this command after defining active views for the design (set_analysis_view). 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-hold <newDefaultHoldView>\fR" Changes the default active hold analysis view to the specified analysis view.  "\fB-setup <newDefaultSetupView>\fR" Changes the default setup analysis view to the specified analysis view. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets missionWCCOM, mission2WCCOM, and missionSlow as the active views for setup analysis, and missionBCCOM and testBCCOM as the active views for hold analysis. The default active setup view is missionWCCOM, and the default active hold view is missionBCCOM.
