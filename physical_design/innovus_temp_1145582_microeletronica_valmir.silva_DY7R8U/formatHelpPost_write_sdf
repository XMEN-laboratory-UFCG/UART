.P Writes delays to a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file. The write_sdf command can generate both plain-text and GNU zipped (.gz) SDF files.
.P By default, the write_sdf command uses the delays already cached by the system and writes only values of the triplets. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-abstracted_model\fR" Saves the gate-level simulation (GLS) SDF file.   "\fB-adjust_setuphold_for_zero_hold_slack\fR" Adjusts the hold timing check to meet non-negative slack values.   "\fB-base_delay\fR" Writes out base delay information in the SDF file.   "\fB-celltiming {all | none | nochecks}\fR" Specifies which cell delays and timing checks to write out.  Default: all
.RS  "*" 2 all - Writes all cell delays and timing checks to the SDF file. This is the default.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 nochecks - Disables the writing of timing checks only.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 none - Prevents cell delays and timing checks from being written into the SDF file.
.RE   "\fB-collapse_internal_pins\fR" Collapses arcs across internal pins to a single primary input to primary output arc.  Use the -collapse_internal_pins parameter when the SDF file being generated is intended for use by an application that does not support the same internal pin structure in its leaf cell libraries (for example, Cadence VXL and NCsim Verilog simulation products). Do not use this parameter to generate an SDF file intended for use within the Innovus flow, or by third party tools that utilize the same Liberty timing models.  Default: Arcs between internal pins in a timing model are written to the SDF file as explicit annotations to and from the internal pins.  For example, assume the following arc between internal pins:   (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   The following SDF would be generated by default:(U1/in1 U1/IntPinA (1::1) (1::1))(U1/IntPinA U1/IntPinB (2::2) (2::2))(U1/IntPinB U1/out1 (3::3) (3::3))  If you specify -collapse_internal_pins, the resulting SDF would show a single arc with the merged delays:(U1/in1 U1/out1 (6::6) (6::6))  "\fB-condelse\fR" Writes CONDELSE constructs with the default value when a COND construct is written.  Note: Use this argument with the -version 3.0 option.  "\fB-delimiter <char>\fR" Specifies the hierarchy divider character to use in the output file. This option sets the hierarchy divider of only the write_sdf command. If omitted, the default hierarchy divider character (/) is used as the write_sdf default.  "\fB-delta_delay\fR" Writes out delta delay values to the SDF file.   "\fB-edges {edged | library | noedge | check_edge}\fR" Specifies the edges values. Refer to Table 38-10 for full qualifications of the possible values for the edges option.  Default: edged
.RS  "*" 2 check_edge - Keeps edge specifiers on timing check arcs but does not add edge specifiers on delay arcs.  "*" 2 edged - Keeps edge specifiers on timing check arcs and delay arcs.  "*" 2 library - Assumes that the sdf_edges attributes are specified in the
.lib file. The default sdf_edges value of a timing arc is noedge.  "*" 2 noedge - Defined in the Table 38-10.
.RE   "\fB-exclude_cells  \fR" Specifies a list of leaf-cell or hierarchical instances whose timing data will be excluded from the the SDF (Standard Delay Format) file. If you specify a hierarchical instance, the timing data for all leaf-cells below the level of hierarchy will be omitted from the SDF file.   "\fB-exclude_cells_keep_io_nets\fR" Restricts the filtering to just the annotations which are completely enclosed by the cell. Annotations to or from the cell will be preserved.  By default, when the -exclude_cells parameter is used, any annotations within the excluded cell and any annotations to or from the excluded cell are filtered from the SDF.  "\fB-exclude_cells_keep_top_level_nets\fR" Allows you to configure the handling of top-level interconnect annotations to an instance that is excluded from the SDF using the write_sdf -exclude_cells parameter.   When this parameter is specified, the interconnect arcs which span to the ports of the instance will be included in the SDF. By default, no interconnect arcs to the instance are included. The delay annotated will be the worst-case delays of the top-level nets to/from the first level sink/source pins within the block that traverse a given input/output port of the instance, respectively.   "\fB-exclude_disabled_arcs\fR" Excludes user set disabled arcs in the Standard Delay Format (SDF) file. If the user sets this option, the disabled arcs set by commands set_mode, set_disable_timing, and set_case_analysis are excluded.  "\fB-exclude_disabled_modes\fR" Excludes timing arcs that have been disabled due to an active library mode set by the set_mode command, from appearing in the SDF file.  "\fB-exclude_whatif_arcs\fR" Excludes what-if arcs in the SDF file.  "\fB<file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the SDF output file. If omitted, this argument defaults to stdout.  "\fB-filter \fR" Converts all negative interconnect and IOPATH delays to zero.  "\fB-ideal_clock_network\fR" Marks delays of delay arcs, that are on the ideal clock networks, as 0 in the SDF file.  "\fB-interconn {all | none | noport | noinport | nooutport}\fR" Specifies which interconnect delays to write.   Default: all
.RS  "*" 2 all - Writes all INTERCONN delays into the SDF file. This is the default if the -interconn option is not specified.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 none - No INTERCONN delays are written into the SDF file.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 noport - No top level port INTERCONN delays are written into the SDF file.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 nooutport - Disables only the output port INTERCONN delays.
.RE   "\fB-map_file {file1 file2
...}\fR" Specifies a list of map files. The map files can be used to determine what is written into the SDF files. For example, a map file can provide delay information on internal pins which are not defined in the timing library.  Syntax for a map file (for a cell) is as follows:
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 A template section (the text to output) that reference variables of the form $<number>
.RE 
.RE
.RS
.RS  "*" 2 A variable definition section that tells the expression to evaluate to obtain the value
.RE 
.RE   "\fB-max_view <viewName>\fR" Uses the late delay from the specified analysis view to populate the SDF max slot, when in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.  "\fB-merge_arcs\fR" Merges two arcs that are related to the same internal pin and forms one timing arc. For example, consider a cell's IOPATH that forms an arc from pin I to internal pin A and another from pin A to output pin O. In this case, if you use the -merge_arcs option, the software will merge both the arcs related to internal pin A and form one timing arc from pin I to output pin O.  "\fB-min_period_edges {posedge | negedge | both | none}\fR" Specifies how to write out minimum PERIOD checks. Two check arcs are always created for the min_period check when you read in a
.lib file. The following options let you keep or remove the positive edge, the negative edge, both edges, or no edges from the PERIOD statement in the
.sdf file.
.RS  "*" 2 posedge - Writes out one positive edge PERIOD check.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 negedge - Writes out one negative edge PERIOD check.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 both - Writes out both the positive edge and the negative edge PERIOD checks. This is the default.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 none - Writes out one PERIOD check without any edge specifier.
.RE   "\fB-min_view <viewName>\fR" Uses the early delay from the specified analysis view to populate the SDF min slot, when in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.  "\fB-no_condition\fR" Suppresses the COND statements in the SDF file.  "\fB-no_derate\fR" Writes non-derated delays to the Standard Delay Format (SDF) file. By default, the set_timing_derate command writes scaled delays to the SDF file.  When the -no_derate parameter is specified, the write_sdf command removes all the applied derates.  "\fB-no_escape\fR" Writes out object names without escaping hierarchical dividers. Normally, when writing out a SDF file, the hierarchical divider (/) is escaped because it is a special character.  "\fB-no_variation\fR" Exports the SDF delay and check values without including the variation component, when the selected analysis type is SOCV.  By default, the SDF delays and check values will have the mean + N*sigma value.  "\fB-nonegchecks\fR" Converts all negative timing check values to 0.0.  The -nonegchecks parameter has an effect only when the negative checks are legal. In SDF v3.0, the negative checks are only legal in the context of RECREM or SETUPHOLD checks - they are not legal in case of split checks.  In SDC v2.1, the negative values are permitted in SETUP, HOLD, and RECOVERY checks. Therefore, for these checks the -nonegchecks parameter is required to convert negative values to zero. The negative checks are legal in the split checks, so the -nonegchecks parameter can have an effect. The SDF v2.1, however, does not support REMOVAL checks.  "\fB-precision <non_neg_integer>\fR" Controls the number of digits appearing after the decimal point in the output SDF file. The default precision is the value of the report_precision.  "\fB-process\fR" Specifies one or a combination of the following process names that will appear in the header of the generated SDF file:
.RS  "*" 2 best
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 typical
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 worst
.RE   Use the colon delimiter to specify multiple process names. For example:  -process best:typical:worst  In the above example, the header of the generated SDF file will contain:  (PROCESS "best:typical:worst")  "\fB-resort_values_min_to_max\fR" Sorts values in the SDF delay triplets into ascending order.  "\fB-recompute_delay_calc\fR" Instructs the software to recompute any necessary data required for a complete SDF file before exporting.   "\fB-recompute_parallel_arcs        \fR" Instructs the software to temporarily recompute delays with separate  delay calculation for parallel arcs.  The software normally operates in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. By default, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option -recompute_parallel_arcs to cause delays for each parallel arc to be explicitly calculated. It is recommended to use this option for generating SDF for functional simulation applications.  Note: When you use the write_sdf -recompute_parallel_arcs option timing analysis is performed again. You need to obtain a new delay calculation to generate the SDF, and another delay calculation to put the system back to where it was before write_sdf was specified. Since delay calculation is run again, timing analysis will be reset.  Note: The -recompute_parallel_arcs parameter is obsolete. This parameter still works in this release, but to ensure compatibility with future releases update your scripts to use the -recompute_delay_calc parameter instead.  "\fB-recrem [merge_always | split | merge_when_paired]\fR" Determines how RECOVERY and REMOVAL timing checks are written.
.RS  "*" 2 merge_always - Always writes combined RECREM checks, even if either a RECOVERY, or a REMOVAL, check does not exist.   For example, if a RECOVERY check exists, but a REMOVAL check does not, the software writes a combined RECREM check in the SDF file as follows:  RECREM (<value>) (<value>) () ()
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 split - Splits the RECREM checks into a RECOVERY check and a REMOVAL check.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 merge_when_paired - Writes combined RECREM checks only when both a RECOVERY and a REMOVAL check exist.   For example, if both a RECOVERY and a REMOVAL check exist, the software writes a combined RECREM check in the SDF file as follows:  RECREM (<value>) (<value>) (<value>) (<value> )   However, if a RECOVERY check exists, but a REMOVAL check does not, the software only writes the RECOVERY check in the SDF file:  RECOVERY (<value>) (<value>)
.RE   Default: merge_always  Note: The RECREM sum should be zero or greater than zero. A negative value will be adjusted to enforce this condition. This is an SDF v3.0 requirement (the software may issue a warning).  "\fB-remashold\fR" Converts the SDF v2.1 unsupported REMOVAL (and the REMOVAL portion of the RECREM constructs) to HOLD checks when used with the -version 2.1 option.  Default: Not to write out the unsupported checks.  Converts the REMOVAL checks to HOLD checks when combined with the -version 3.0 option.The RECREM checks are split into a RECOVERY check and a HOLD check. This option automatically splits the RECREM checks.   Default: To maintain the version 3.0 checks.  "\fB-scale <float>\fR" Specifies a multiplier to the delay values used in the SDF file. This option does not change the timescale setting of the SDF file. The delay values are scaled, but the units are the same.  Default: 1  "\fB-setuphold [merge_always | split | merge_when_paired]\fR" Determines how SETUP and HOLD timing checks are written.
.RS  "*" 2 merge_always - Always writes combined SETUPHOLD checks, even if either a SETUP or a HOLD, check does not exist.   For example, if a SETUP check exists, but a HOLD check does not, the software writes a combined SETUPHOLD check in the SDF file as follows:  SETUPHOLD (<value>) (<value>) () ()
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 split - Splits the SETUPHOLD timing checks into separate SETUP and HOLD checks.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 merge_when_paired - Writes combined SETUPHOLD checks only when both a SETUP and a HOLD check exist.   For example, if both a SETUP and a HOLD check exist, the software writes a combined SETUPHOLD check in the SDF file as follows:  SETUPHOLD (<value>) (<value>) (<value>) (<value> )   However, if a SETUP check exists, but a HOLD check does not, the software only writes the SETUP check in the SDF file:  SETUP (<value>) (<value>)
.RE   Default: merge_always  "\fB-splitrecrem\fR" Splits the RECREM checks into a RECOVERY check and a REMOVAL check.  Default: To write the combined RECREM check.  Note: Use this option only with the version 3.0 option.  "\fB-splitsetuphold\fR" Splits the SETUPHOLD timing checks into separate SETUP and HOLD checks.  Default: To write the combined SETUPHOLD checks.  Note: In SDC v3.0, the negative values are illegal in SETUP, HOLD, RECOVERY, and REMOVAL checks. Therefore, the negative values are converted to zero automatically with the -splitsetuphold and -splitrecrem parameters.  "\fB-temperature   \fR" Defines the temperature values that will appear in the header of the generated SDF file.  Use the colon delimiter to specify multiple temperature values. For example:  -temperature -40.0:25.0:125  In the above example, the header of the generated SDF file will contain:  (TEMPERATURE -40.0:25.0:125)  "\fB-timingcheck {order}\fR" Sorts the check delays in OCV analysis.   "\fB-target_application { sta | verilog}\fR" Allows customization of the SDF output for use with STA or Verilog applications. You can select the following options:
.RS  "*" 2 sta: You can use the sta option to configure the SDF output for use with static-timing analysis (STA) applications. This includes sign-off timing analysis with products, such as Cadence Tempus, as well as for working with implementation flows that use STA for internal timing analysis. The sta option preserves maximum accuracy and generates SDF output that matches the structure of the Liberty timing libraries.  This option is equivalent to the following options:  write_sdf -interconn all, -celltiming all, -edges edged, -setupholdmerge_when_paired, and -recrem merge_when_paired. 
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 verilog: You can use the verilog option to generate SDF output that is compatible with Cadence Verilog-XL or Verilog-NC simulators.  This option is equivalent to the following options:  write_sdf -filter -edges check_edge, -setuphold merge_when_paired, -recremmerge_when_paired, -min_period_edges -none, -collapse_internal_pins, and -recompute_parallel_arcs. 
.RE   When the -target_application option is not specified then by default SDF output is configured for use with STA applications.  "\fB-transform_out_to_out_arcs\fR" Writes out all output-to-output timing arcs as input-to-output arcs. Input-to-output arc delays are computed by adding the delay from the input pin to one of the output pins plus the delay from that output pin to the other output pin. For instance, in the following figure, the delay between in and out2 would be the sum of delay1 and delay2.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "\fB-typ_view <viewName>\fR" Uses the late delay from the specified analysis view to populate the SDF typ slot, when in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode.  "\fB-version {2.1 | 3.0}\fR" Specifies whether to generate the SDF V2.1 or V3.0. The default SDF version is 3.0. Used in combination with the -remashold option.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Uses the early and late delays for the specified analysis view to populate the min and max SDF triplet slots, when in multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode. The SDF typ slot remains empty (<earlyVal>::<lateVal>).  In multi-mode multi-corner analysis mode, if you want to use SPEF information when calculating the delays, you must use spefIn -rc_corner to import the SPEF files for each RC corner in the design.  "\fB-voltage\fR" Defines the voltage values that will appear in the header of the generated SDF file.  Use the colon delimiter to specify multiple voltage values. For example:  -voltage 1.980:1.800:1.620  In the above example, the header of the generated SDF file will contain:  (VOLTAGE 1.980:1.800:1.620)

.RS  "*" 2 The following example SDF files compare the output of -edges edged to the output of -edges noedge.   Resultant SDF with -edges set to edged:  (HOLD (posedge D) (posedge CK) (-0.14:-0.14:-0.14)) (HOLD (negedge D) (posedge CK) (-0.06:-0.06:-0.06)) (SETUP (posedge D) (posedge CK) (0.22:0.22:0.22)) (SETUP (negedge D) (posedge CK) (0.41:0.41:0.41))   With -edges set to noedge only the edge specifiers of the clock pin are written.  (HOLD D (posedge CK) (-0.14:-0.06:-0.06)) (SETUP D (posedge CK) (0.22:0.41:0.41))
