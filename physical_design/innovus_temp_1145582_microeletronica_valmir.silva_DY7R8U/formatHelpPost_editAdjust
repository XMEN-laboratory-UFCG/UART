.SH Syntax \fBeditAdjust\fR  [-help]  [-adjust_size]   -refer_obj {top bottom left right}   {[-align_edge {left center right top middle bottom diag45_top diag45_middle diag45_bottom diag135_top diag135_middle diag135_bottom}]    [-space_mode {horizontal vertical dist_horizontal dist_vertical diag45 diag135 dist_diag45 dist_diag135}      [-space <float_value>]]} 
.P Aligns wires and pins on the basis of the specified options. The following objects can be aligned using this command:
.RS  "*" 2  Regular, special, and patch wires  "*" 2  Physical pins  "*" 2  Macro pins
.RE
.P The editAdjust command enables you to align objects in one or both of the following modes:
.RS  "*" 2 Align by edge: Use the -align_edge parameter to align objects with the reference object by the specified edge.  "*" 2 Align with spacing: Use the -space_mode parameter to adjust the spacing between objects.  
.RE 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editAdjust parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man editAdjust  "\fB-adjust_size  \fR" Resizes the objects being aligned to match the reference object. If -align_edge is specified, the specified edge of the objects is stretched or shrunk to align with the edge of the reference object. If -space_mode is specified, the objects being aligned are resized to be equal to the reference object.  "\fB-align_edge {left center right top middle bottom diag45_top diag45_middle diag45_bottom diag135_top diag135_middle diag135_bottom}\fR" Specifies the edge by which the objects should be aligned with the reference object.   "\fB-refer_obj {top bottom left right} \fR" Specifies the object of reference for alignment. For example, -refer_obj left means that objects should be aligned with reference to the leftmost object.  This option is mandatory.  "\fB-space <float_value>\fR" Specifies the spacing value for aligning objects in the space mode. This option can be specified only if -space_mode is specified.   "\fB-space_mode {horizontal vertical dist_horizontal dist_vertical diag45 diag135 dist_diag45 dist_diag135}\fR" Specifies that objects should be aligned in the space mode. In this mode, the objects are aligned such that there is equal spacing between them. You can specify one of the following space mode options:
.RS  "*" 2 horizontal - Aligns the objects such that the horizontal spacing between them is equal to the value specified with -space.  "*" 2 vertical - Aligns the objects such that the vertical spacing between them is equal to the value specified with -space.  "*" 2 dist_horizontal - Distributes the objects horizontally.  "*" 2 dist_vertical - Distributes the objects vertically.  "*" 2 diag45 - Aligns the objects in the 45-degree direction such that the spacing between them is equal to the value specified with -space.   "*" 2 diag135 - Aligns the objects in the 135-degree direction such that the spacing between them is equal to the value specified with -space.  "*" 2 dist_diag45 - Distributes the objects in the 45-degree direction.  "*" 2 dist_diag135 - Distributes the objects in the 135-degree direction.

.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2  The following command aligns the left edge of all the wires using the leftmost object as reference:   editAdjust -align_edge left -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command uses the leftmost wire as reference and resizes the other wires so that their left edges align with the left edge of the reference wire:   editAdjust -align_edge left -refer_obj left -adjust_size  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command aligns the center of all the wires using the leftmost object as reference:   editAdjust -align_edge center -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command aligns the right edge of all the wires using the leftmost object as reference:   editAdjust -align_edge right -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command aligns the top edge of all the wires using the leftmost object as reference:   editAdjust -align_edge top -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command aligns the bottom edge of all the wires using the leftmost object as reference:   editAdjust -align_edge bottom -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command uses the leftmost object as reference and aligns the wires in the horizontal direction in the space mode with a spacing of 5 units:   editAdjust -space_mode horizontal -space 5 -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command uses the leftmost object as reference and aligns the wires in the horizontal direction in the space mode with a spacing of 5 units. The command also resizes the objects being aligned to match the reference object:   editAdjust -space_mode horizontal -space 5 -refer_obj left -adjust_size  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   "*" 2  The following command uses the leftmost object as reference and aligns the wires in the vertical direction in the space mode with a spacing of 15 units:   editAdjust -space_mode vertical -space 15 -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command uses the leftmost object as reference and distributes the wires horizontally:   editAdjust -space_mode dist_horizontal -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command uses the leftmost object as reference and distributes the wires vertically:   editAdjust -space_mode dist_vertical -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2  The following command uses the leftmost object as reference and aligns the left edge of all the wires, keeping a spacing of 5 units between the wires in the vertical direction:   editAdjust -align_edge left -space_mode vertical -space 5 -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)  "*" 2 The following command uses the leftmost object as reference and aligns the wires in the 135-degree direction in the space mode with a spacing of 5 units:   editAdjust -space_mode diag135 -space 5.0 -refer_obj left  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)
