.SH Name \fBcreateNetGroup\fR \-  Creates an empty net group
.SH Syntax \fBcreateNetGroup\fR  [-help]   [-mixed_signal]   [-spacing  <minSpaceInTracks>]   [ {[-optimizeOrder ]} | -spreadPin | -compact_area ]   [-excludePin {allLayer | sameLayer | allLayerInGuidedArea} [-keep_out_spacing <integer>]]   { [<netGroupName> [-net <netNameList>]]}
.P Creates an empty net group. A net group can contain net names, bus names, or segments of a bus. To add nets into the net group, use the addNetToNetGroup command. You can use this command after importing the design.
.P Note: If a net is part of a net group, and you add the same net to another net group, the Innovus software will display a warning, but the net will be added to the second net group too. However, when pin assignment is performed, the net is considered part only of the first net group to which it was added - and not part of any other net group to which it was subsequently added. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-compact_area\fR" Specifies that pins in the group are assigned tightly together. By default, pins which are part of a group and associated to a guide can be spread inside the guide based on the area available and alignment to targets. The compact_area option, when used, ignores the alignment and available area and forces the pins to the minimum area on guide honoring the minimum spacing constraint and overlooking any alignment to targets.  (<Image> To view the image, refer to the Innovus Text Command Reference - Release 22.1 manual.)   Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-excludePin {allLayer | sameLayer | allLayerInGuidedArea}\fR" Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins on all layers, same layer, or on all layers in the guided area.
.RS  "*" 2 allLayer: Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins between grouped pins on all layers.  "*" 2 sameLayer: Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins grouped pins on all same layer.  "*" 2 allLayerInGuidedArea: Specifies that pins in the group exclude foreign pins in the guide area defined for the group, on all layers.
.RE    Note: If guide is not defined for a group down the flow, allLayerInGuidedArea option would be treated like -excludePin {allLayer} for the group without guides behavior.  Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each createNetGroup parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man createNetGroup.  "\fB-keep_out_spacing <integer>\fR" Specifies the minimum spacing between the pins placed outside of the group, in number of tracks or pitch.  Minimum: 0  Maximum: 65535  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-mixed_signal\fR" Specifies to identify a mixed signal group.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-net <netNameList>\fR" Specifies the name of the net(s). You can use wildcards (*?) with this parameter.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB<netGroupName>\fR" Specifies the name of the created net group name.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-optimizeOrder\fR" Specifies that pins in the group are reordered to optimize wire length. If this option is not selected, the pin order is exactly as specified in the pin group.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-spacing <minSpaceInTracks>\fR" Specifies the minimum spacing between the pins of the net group.  Default: The default value is two tracks.  Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-spreadPin\fR" Specifies that pins in the group must be distributed evenly.  Data_type: bool, optional
