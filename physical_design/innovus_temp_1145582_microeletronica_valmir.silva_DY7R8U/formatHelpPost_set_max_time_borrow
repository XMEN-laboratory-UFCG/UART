.TH set_max_time_borrow  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_max_time_borrow\fR \-  Specifies the maximum time that can be borrowed by one stage from the next logic stage following a latch to meet timing constraints
.SH Syntax \fBset_max_time_borrow\fR  <borrow_value>  <object_list> 
.P Specifies the maximum time that can be borrowed by one stage from the next logic stage following a latch to meet timing constraints. Time borrowing is sometimes called cycle stealing. Time borrowing is performed automatically when performing timing analysis.
.P Use the set_max_time_borrow assertion on pins or waveforms. If the assertion is placed on a clock waveform, all latches triggered by this clock signal get the specified maximum time borrow limit. If both the clock waveform arriving at the clock pin of a latch and the clock pin itself have time borrow limit constraints, the maximum borrow limit on the latch is decided by the assertion on the latch clock pin. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<borrow_value>\fR" Specifies the maximum amount of time that can be borrowed. The minimum value allowed is 0, which disables time borrowing. The maximum allowed is equal to the pulse width minus the setup time: Max = pulse width - setup  "\fB<object_list>\fR" Specifies the list of instance pins, instances, or clocks on which the borrow value is applied. The object<_list> argument can be a collection.
