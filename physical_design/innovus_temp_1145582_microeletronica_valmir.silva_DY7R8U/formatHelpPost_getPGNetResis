.TH getPGNetResis  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBgetPGNetResis\fR \-  Computes the resistance of the power or ground net
.SH Syntax \fBgetPGNetResis\fR  [-help]  [-net {netName +}]  [-outfile <fileName>]  [-temperature <temperature>]  [-view <viewName>]  [-worst | -p2p <<x1 y1 layerName1 x2 y2 layerName2>]
.P Computes the resistance of the power or ground net. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each getPGNetResis parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all its parameters, use the man command:  man getPGNetResis.  "\fB-net {netName +}\fR" Specifies the name of the net for which resistance is to be computed. The command accepts multiple names.  Note: The total resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistance of each individual wire and via, rather than the effective resistance of the entire resistor network.  "\fB-outfile <fileName>\fR" Creates a report containing the nets' resistance values. The power analysis software adds the extension
.res to the fileName you specify.   "\fB-temperature <temperature>\fR" Specifies the temperature to be used during temperature-dependent resistance extraction. The temperature-dependent resistance coefficient is taken from the capacitance table.   "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Specifies the view to analyze.   "\fB-worst\fR" For cases where a special net , that connects two or more instances by their non-PG pins, reports information on the worst (largest) effective resistance based on pair of pins, and the path that has the worst resistance.   "\fB-p2p <x1 y1 layerName1 x2 y2 layerName2\fR" Computes the effective resistance between two instance pins. The point/layer specification is used to find the corresponding pin for calculation.
.RS  "*" 2 If you do not specify the option -p2p, the total resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistance of each individual wire and via.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 If you specify the option -p2p, the total resistance is the effective resistance of the entire resistor network.
.RE   Use the option -p2p with caution as it will take a while to get an effective R from large PG nets. 
.SH Example
.RS  "*" 2 The following command displays a report within the Innovus console:   pgNetResis vdd!  "*" 2 The report is generated with the format shown in the following example:  Net Name: vdd!  total resistance: 5.843993e+01 Ohm  1 resistance: 3.530900e+01 Ohm  2 resistance: 0.000000e+00 Ohm  3 resistance: 0.000000e+00 Ohm  4 resistance: 0.000000e+00 Ohm  5 resistance: 2.459333e+00 Ohm  6 resistance: 2.324933e+00 Ohm   V12 resistance: 3.360000e+00 Ohm   V23 resistance: 3.360000e+00 Ohm   V34 resistance: 3.360000e+00 Ohm   V45 resistance: 5.600000e+00 Ohm   V56 resistance: 2.666667e+00 Ohm   resistance of selected wires/vias: 1.666667e-01 Ohm
