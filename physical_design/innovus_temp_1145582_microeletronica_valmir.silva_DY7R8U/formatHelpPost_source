.SH Name \fBsource\fR \-  Reads a file and executes the commands in the file (scripts)
.SH Syntax \fBsource\fR   [-help]   filename   [-quiet  | -verbose ] [-quiet  | -echo ] 
.P Reads a file and executes the commands in the file (scripts). You can source an encrypted file created by the encrypt command. To be sourced, the file must have suffix p added to the file name, for example, test.tcl being encrypted as test.tclp.
.P Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Describes the command usage.  "\fB<filename>\fR" Specifies the name of the file to source.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-quiet\fR" Disable verbose source.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-verbose\fR" Enable verbose source.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-echo         \fR" Enable verbose source.  Data_type: bool, optional
.P With no -quiet, -verbose, -echo argument, file is sourced according to the enc_source_verbose    global.
.P Note that the setting of -quiet, -verbose, -echo argument only affects the verbosity of sourcing the outermost file. If that file contains nested source commands, the verbosity of those nested commands is controlled by their associated [-quiet | -verbose | -echo] arguments or the      enc_source_verbose    global if no arguments.
