.TH trace_obj_connectivity  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBtrace_obj_connectivity\fR \-  Traces the connections of specified macros, selected macros, or specified ports
.SH Syntax \fBtrace_obj_connectivity\fR  [-help]   [-clear_trace]   [-level <level>]   [-mode {netlist_based timing_based}]   [-out_file <file_name>]  [-insts <string>] | [-ports <string>] | [-selected ] | [-in_files <file_name>]
.P Traces the connections of specified macros, selected macros, or specified ports. You can also trace the connections based on netlist or timing. It supports different levels. You can also set global parameters for the trace_obj_connectivity by using the set_trace_obj_connectivity_mode command. Parameters that you specify with set_trace_obj_connectivity_mode are then used automatically whenever you run the trace_obj_connectivity command or use the Trace Macro form. You can use this command after proto_design, place_design, or even after the whole design is completed.   
.SH Parameters   "\fB-clear_trace\fR" Clears the existing trace result.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each trace_obj_connectivity parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man trace_obj_connectivity  "\fB-in_files <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the file from which saved trace macro results are loaded.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-insts <string>\fR" Specifies the macros to be traced.  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-level <level>\fR" Specifies the trace level.  Maximum Level: 10  Minimum Level:  1  Default: 1   Data_type: int, optional  "\fB-mode {netlist_based timing_based}\fR" Specifies the trace mode to use:
.RS  "*" 2 netlist_based: Specifies that connection of the macro will be traced based on the netlist.   "*" 2 timing_based: Specifies that connection of the macro will be traced based on advanced timing tcl scripts command all_fanin and all_fanout.
.RE   Data_type: enum, optional  "\fB-out_file <file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the file in which the trace macro results are saved.  Default: <top_module_name>.tmcdb  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB-ports <string>\fR" Specifies the names of the ports to be traced.  Data_type: string, optional   "\fB-selected\fR" Traces the selected macros or ports.  Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command traces the connections for blk1 upto level 3:  trace_obj_connectivity -insts blk1 -level 3
