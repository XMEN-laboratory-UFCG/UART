.SH Name \fBsetPathGroupOptions\fR \-  Specifies options to guide timing optimization and timing analysis when path groups are used. To reset parameters to their default value, use resetPathGroupOptions
.SH Syntax \fBsetPathGroupOptions\fR    [-help]  <pathgroupName>[-early]  [-effortLevel {low | high}]  [-late]  [-skewingSlackConstraint <value_in_ns>]  [-slackAdjustment <float>]  [-slackAdjustmentPriority <integer>]  [-targetSlack <float>]  [-view <view_names>]  [-weight  <integer>]  
.P Specifies options to guide timing optimization and timing analysis when path groups are used. To reset parameters to their default value, use resetPathGroupOptions. 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setPathGroupOptions parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man setPathGroupOptions  "\fB-early\fR" Specifies early mode.  This parameter is used with the -slackAdjustment option when you wish to adjust a path group's slack in Hold timing mode only.  Note the following:
.RS  "*" 2 If you do not specify either -early or -late, then -late is implied.  "*" 2 If you specify -early, then -early is used.  "*" 2 If you specify -late, then -late is used.  "*" 2 If you specify both -early and -late, then both -early and -late are used, which means the same value of -early and -late are set at the same time.
.RE   For example,  setPathGroupOptions reg2reg -slackAdjustment -0.3 -early -late  Slack adjustment of -0.3 applied on reg2reg path_group  **INFO: Setting reg2reg as high effort level since it has a negative slack adjustment.

This parameter is honored by timing optimization (optDesign).  Select one of the following options:  low: Specifies that this path group is optimized together with other path groups for best overall slack. low is the default effort value for all user-created path groups.  Note: Cadence recommends you specify low effort for all path groups except that ones that the tool should focus on most strongly.  high: Specifies that this path group is optimized separately from the low-effort path groups in order to achieve the best possible WNS for this path group.  Default: low  "\fB<pathgroupName>\fR" Specifies the path group for which to set options.   "\fB-late\fR" Specifies late mode.  This parameter is used with the -slackAdjustment option when you wish to adjust a path group's slack in Setup timing mode only. For usage details, see the description of the -early parameter.  "\fB-skewingSlackConstraint <value_in_ns>\fR" When set, applies the specified skewing slack constraint to the path group. The value specified is in nanoseconds. If not set, no skewing slack constraint is applied to the path group.  This parameter provides the ability to control the I/O slack during skewing without degrading the core slack value. The skewing engine skews in a way not to make any already -ve slack path more -ve or not introduce a new -ve slack path.  Examples:  If the following is specified:  setPathGroupOptions R2O -skewingSlackConstraint 0  Before skewing: FF's D slack is -100 ps(R2R), Q slack is -20ps (R2O)  After skewing: D slack is -100ps, Q slack is -20ps  Before skewing: FF's D slack is -100 ps(R2R), Q slack is 30ps (R2O)  After skewing: D slack is -70ps, Q slack is 0ps  Note:
.RS  "*" 2 This option can control CCOpt useful skew. If you are running ECF (early clock flow), preCTS will use CCOpt useful skew engine to do skewing. in this scenario, this option will take effect.  "*" 2 This option can control postCTS skewClock behavior  "*" 2 This option does not impact timing analysis
.RE   "\fB-slackAdjustment <float>\fR" Specifies a positive or negative value used to modify path constraints on all paths that are part of a specific path group. The value is in nanoseconds.  To relax the path constraints computed by the timing engine, specify a positive value. To tighten the timing constraints, specify a negative value.  This parameter is honored by timing optimization (optDesign) and timing analysis (report_timing). This means that that the -slackAdjustment parameter setting impacts the timing analysis result and all optimization is then performed based on this timing. Using this parameter might have an impact on run time during timing optimization.  Note: Path groups with negative slack adjustment will be automatically set to high effort, unless the -effortLevel option is explicitly set to "'low". For positive slack adjustment, the effort level will remain the same. This means if the effort is low before setting a positive slack adjustment, the new effort will be low; if the effort is high before setting a positive slack adjustment, the new effort will be high.  Tip: Use this parameter together with the -effort parameter to direct timing optimization focus.  "\fB-slackAdjustmentPriority <integer>\fR" Provides priority to a path group for the slack adjustment feature. The paths that are a part of overlapping path groups get slack adjustment from the path group that has a higher priority value. If the number is higher, the priority is higher. In case of multiple overlapping path groups with different slack adjustment values, the most constraining slack adjustment is applied.  Default: 0  Note: The -slackAdjustmentPriority parameter is ignored if -slackAdjustment is not specified.  "\fB-targetSlack <float>\fR" Specifies a target value for setup slack, in nanoseconds, for all paths that are part of a specific path group. The value can be positive or negative.  This parameter is honored by timing optimization (optDesign). Using this parameter might have an impact on run time during timing optimization.  Note: Setting this parameter does not impact the timing analysis results, and only setup optimization considers the target slack as the goal of optimization.  The path group target slack (setPathGroupOptions -targetSlack) and the global setup target slack (setOptMode -opt_setup_target_slack) are cumulative. When both are set, global setup target slack adds on top of what is specified using the setPathGroupOptions -targetSlack parameter. The effective number depends upon whether path group target slack number is positive or negative.  The global setup target slack is the timing closure target for timing optimization.  Note: When both, -slackAdjustment and -targetSlack parameters are set, the setup optimization considers the target slack based on slack adjustment timing.  "\fB-view <view_names>\fR" Specifies the view names. This parameter is used when you want to specify different effort levels of the path group for different views.  Default: {}  Note: When this parameter is used, only the specified views are active for timing analysis on the path group. Any timing reporting on this path group with inactive views will result in an error.  "\fB-weight <integer>\fR" Defines the optimization priority. For the default path groups, the software assigns weights in the following manner:
.RS  "*" 2 For high-effort path groups: the software assigns a weight of "1" to reg2cgate and "2" to reg2reg.  "*" 2 All low-effort path groups are assigned a default weight of "0". 
.RE   You can assign any value to this parameter ( 0 to INT_MAX). There is no upper limit.  The software looks at the relative priority of the weights for each path group -- the higher the number, the higher the weight. For example, if there are 10 path groups with weights ranging from 1 to 10 and they are all high-effort path groups, the high-effort optimization for all these ten path groups will be started simultaneously. If, however, the optimization is stuck at the path group with the weight 6, the software drops all the path groups that have weights ranging from 1 to 6 and continues to work on the remaining four path groups.  Note: Use this parameter to control optimization and not slackAdjustmentPriority, which only controls the slackAdjustment. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 To change the timing measured for all setup paths in PATH_GROUP_A by relaxing the required time by 2 nanoseconds, specify:   setPathGroupOptions PATH_GROUP_A -slackAdjustment 2
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 To change the timing measured for all setup paths in PATH_GROUP_B by tightening the required time by 0.2 nanoseconds, specify:   setPathGroupOptions PATH_GROUP_B -slackAdjustment -0.2
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 To direct the optDesign command to optimize paths in PATH_GROUP_C until the worst setup slack in that path group is better than 2 nanoseconds, specify:   setPathGroupOptions PATH_GROUP_C -targetSlack 2  optDesign  When these commands run, the software internally subtracts 2 nanoseconds from the required time for all paths of PATH_GROUP_C.   Note that the optDesign command stops optimization when it no longer thinks that it can make progress, regardless of the slack target.  "*" 2 To change the timing measured for all hold paths in PATH_GROUP_D by relaxing the required time by 0.2 nanoseconds, specify:  setPathGroupOptions PATH_GROUP_D -slackAdjustment +0.2 -early  "*" 2 The following commands are used to set the  effort level, skewing slack constraint, weight, and views of the two path groups, and generate a report using these parameters:  setPathGroupOptions reg2reg -effortLevel low -skewingSlackConstraint 0.3 -view AV_HL_FUNC_MIN_RC1  setPathGroupOptions reg2cgate -effortLevel high-skewingSlackConstraint 0.5 -view AV_HL_FUNC_MAX_RC1  reportPathGroupOptions  The software prints the following report:
