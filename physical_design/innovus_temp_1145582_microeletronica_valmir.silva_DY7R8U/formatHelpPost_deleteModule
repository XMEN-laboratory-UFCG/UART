.P Deletes a hierarchical instance and it's module and optionally, its cell. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes the type and default information for each deleteModule parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man deleteModule.  "\fB-cell \fR" Deletes the module of the hierarchical instance. It only works when the specified hierarchical instance is the last one in the design that references this module.   "\fB-cells \fR" Deletes all submodules that are hierarchically inside the module from which the given hierarchical instance <moduleName> is instantiated. If a submodule is multi-referenced and all sibling hierarchical instances instantiated from the submodule are hierarchically inside the <moduleName> hierarchical instance, the submodule will be deleted. Otherwise, the multi-referenced submodule will not be deleted.  "\fB<moduleName>\fR" Specifies the hierarchical instance to delete.
