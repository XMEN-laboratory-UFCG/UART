.TH setWhatIfClockLatency  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBsetWhatIfClockLatency\fR \-  Specifies the clock insertion delay from a clock input port to register clock input pins within a blackbox or blackblob
.SH Syntax  \fBsetWhatIfClockLatency\fR  <blackBoxCellName>  [-clockFrom <clockPortName>]   [-init <value>]   [-new <value>]   [-genConstr <value>]  
.P Specifies the clock insertion delay from a clock input port to register clock input pins within a blackbox or blackblob.
.P You can use this command after the module definition of the blackbox or the blackblob is available with the I/O's in the Verilog netlist. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB<blackBoxCellName>\fR" Specifies the name of the blackbox or blackblob cell.  "\fB-clockFrom <clockPortName>\fR" Specifies the name of the clock input port. If you do not specify this parameter, the clock insertion delay is specified for all input and bidirectional clock ports.  "\fB-init <value>\fR" Specifies the current clock insertion delay value. This value indicates the clock insertion delay used when the software generates the original timing model. This value is used for timing checks or sequential timing arcs. You must specify this value before modifying a timing check or a sequential timing arc. If you modify at least one timing arc, you cannot directly change the clock latency value. You must first delete the timing arc specifications of the blackboxes or blackblobs using the deleteWhatIfTimingAssertions command.  "\fB-new <value>\fR" Specifies the new clock latency value. This value modifies the clock insertion delay. As the clock insertion delay is included in the timing arc value, the software adds the difference between the current and new clock latency value to all timing arcs starting from the specified clock port. Therefore all timing arcs starting from the specified clock port, including the timing arcs that were not modified using the what-if timing commands, are modified.  "\fB-genConstr <value>\fR" Specifies the latency to consider in the what-if timing constraints generation. By default, the value is automatically set to the current clock insertion delay. If you do not modify the latency value, the generated SDC constraints reflect the timing analysis done at the top level. If you set a latency value other than current clock insertion delay, the timing analysis is not impacted.
