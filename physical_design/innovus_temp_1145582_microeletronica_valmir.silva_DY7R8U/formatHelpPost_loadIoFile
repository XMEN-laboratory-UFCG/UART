.SH Name \fBloadIoFile\fR \-  Loads an I/O assignment file. You can use this command after importing the design
.SH Syntax  \fBloadIoFile\fR  [-help]  <file_name>  [-noAdjustDieSize]   [-specifiedIosOnly]   [-ECO [-padsOnly | -bumpsOnly]] 
.P Loads an I/O assignment file. You can use this command after importing the design.
.P Notes:
.RS  "*" 2 By default, the loadIoFile command will automatically adjust the die size to accommodate all the IOs. If this command is used after floorplanning, it would change the die size defined in the floorplan file. If you do not want the die size to be automatically adjusted, use the -noAdjustDieSize parameter.  "*" 2 During I/O inst placement, the space value determines the distance between the current inst and the previous inst. Earlier,  while honoring  iopad spacing, the loadIoFile command considers the previous inst to be the inst that appears before the current inst when insts are placed according the io_order specified in the I/O assignment file

.SH Parameters    "\fB-bumpsOnly\fR" Loads only bump ECO operations in specified IO file.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-ECO\fR" Allows I/O ECO change by loading a new I/O file. In a chip-package co-design situation, when I/O Planner (IOP) utility in SiP is used for modifying the I/O and bump information, the modified information needs to be passed to Innovus. When -ECO is specified, loadIoFile overwrites the existing setting for I/Os and bumps with the information from the new I/O file.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB<file_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the I/O assignment file.  Data_type: string, required  "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each loadIoFile parameter.For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man loadIoFile  "\fB-noAdjustDieSize\fR" Specifies that the die size should not be adjusted automatically.  Data_type: bool, optional   "\fB-padsOnly\fR" Loads only IO pad ECO operations in the specified IO file.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-specifiedIosOnly\fR" Loads only the IO in the specified IO file. This parameter enables you to place IO cells listed in the I/O assignment file without deleting or moving the IO cells not listed in I/O assignment file.   Data_type: bool, optional 
.SH Example
.P The following command loads the I/O assignment file myPinFile.io:
