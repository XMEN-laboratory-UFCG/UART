.P Deselects wires and vias based on specified parameters. Use this command when nets are selected.
.P You can use this command to deselect nets by property. For example, to delete all regular nets except clock nets, select all regular nets with editSelect, deselect the clock nets with this command, then delete the selected nets with editDelete.
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Prints a brief description that includes type and default information for each editDeselect parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man editDeselect  "\fB-area {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}\fR" Specifies the coordinates for the area from which to deselect wires and vias.  "\fB-direction {H | V | 45 | 135}\fR" Specifies the orientation of the wires to deselect.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, deselects wires in any orientation.
.RS  "*" 2  H: Specifies that horizontal wires are to be deselected.  "*" 2  V: Specifies that vertical wires are to be deselected.  "*" 2 45: Specifies that 45-degree wires are to be deselected.  "*" 2 135: Specifies that 135-degree wires are to be deselected.
.RE   "\fB-floating_via\fR" Specifies that only floating vias are to be deselected. A via, or a stack of vias, is floating, if it is not connected to another object, wire, pin, or via, on either its top or bottom metal layer or on both these layers.   "\fB-from_pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the starting pin of the wire to be deselected.  The starting pin you specify should be connected to the same net as the ending pin specified with -to_pin. If they connect to different nets, the tool reports an error.  Note: Deselection of wires between specified pins is supported only for signal and clock nets.  "\fB-layer <list_of_layers>\fR" Specifies the layers from which to deselect wires and vias. This option supports backside and Through Silicon Via (TSV) layers as well.  If you are specifying multiple layers, enclose the names in braces.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, deselects wires and vias from all layers.  "\fB-net <net>*\fR" Specifies the net names from which to deselect wires and vias.  Note: You can use wildcard values in this field. For example, if you specify V*, deselects wires and vias from nets VDD and VSS.  "\fB-object_type {Wire Via} \fR" Specifies whether wires or vias or both should be deselected. If the parameter is not specified, only wires are deselected.  Default: Wire  "\fB-physical_pin_only\fR" Specifies that physical pins are to be deselected. By default, editDeselect does not deselect physical pins.  You can use the -physical_pin_only parameter along with -area, -layer, or -net to deselect the physical pins in the specified area, layer, or net, respectively.  "\fB-regular_wire_with_drc\fR" Deselects regular wires with violation markers.   "\fB-shape {RING STRIPE FOLLOWPIN IOWIRE COREWIRE BLOCKWIRE PADRING BLOCKRING FILLWIRE FILLWIREOPC DRCFILL None}\fR" Specifies the shapes of the wires and vias to be deselected. Use all upper-case letters for the shapes. If you specify multiple shapes, enclose the list of shapes in braces. For shape definitions, see Shapes, in the "DEF Syntax" chapter of the LEF/DEF Language Reference.  Default: If you do not specify this parameter, deselects wires and vias of all shapes.  "\fB-shield\fR" Deselects the wires and vias of the nets specified with the -net parameter, along with the wires and vias shielding the specified nets.  Note: This parameter cannot be used with -shield_only.  "\fB-shield_only\fR" Deselects only the shield wires associated with the nets specified using the -net parameter. The signal nets being shielded remain selected.  Note: This parameter cannot be used with -shield.  "\fB-status {COVER FIXED NOSHIELD ROUTED SHIELD UNKNOWN}\fR" Specifies the status of the wires and vias to be deselected. Use all upper-case letters for the status. If you specify more than one status, enclose the status list in curly braces.  Note: If you select -type Special -status NOSHIELD or -type Signal -status SHIELD the software generates an error message.  "\fB-subclass <sublass_name>\fR" Specifies the subclass name of the wires and vias to be deselected. Use this parameter if you want to deselect wires or vias belonging to a specific subclass. Here, <subclass_name> is a user-defined attribute that has been previously defined using the -uda parameter of the addSplitPowerVia, addRing, addStripe, or sroute command.  For wires, use this parameter if you want to deselect or delete rings, stripes, or other wires belonging to a specific subclass. Only special wire is supported by this option.  Note: You can use wildcards in <subclass_name>.   "\fB-to_pin <pin_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the ending pin of the wire to be deselected.  The ending pin you specify should be connected to the same net as the starting pin specified with -from_pin. If they connect to different nets, the tool reports an error. In addition, the from and to pins you specify should be connected to the same wire. If there there are more than one wire or via between the specified starting and ending pins, the command is not able to deselect the wire path and returns an error.  The -from_pin and -to_pin parameters are compatible with only the -direction, -layer, -object_type, and -status options of the editDeselect command. If you use -from_pin and -to_pin with any other editDeselect parameters, the tool returns an error.  Note: Deselection of wires between specified pins is supported only for signal and clock nets.  "\fB-type {Regular Special Patch}\fR" Specifies whether to deselect regular wires and vias, special wires and vias, or patch wires.  Note: If you specify Regular, you must omit the -shape parameter or specify -shape None.  "\fB-use {CLOCK POWER SIGNAL}\fR" Specifies whether to deselect only CLOCK wires/vias, POWER wires, or SIGNAL wires.   "\fB-via_cell <cell_name_list>\fR" Specifies the via cells of the vias to be deselected. You can use wildcards while specifying via cell names. If you are specifying multiple cell names, enclose them in braces.   "\fB-with_edit_flag {0 | 1}\fR" Deselects all modified wires and vias, that is wires and vias with value 1 for the isEdit property on the net.  Notes
.RS  "*" 2 As the isEdit property is added on the whole net, all the wires and vias on the net with isEdit value set to 1 will be deselected.  "*" 2 The isEdit property is used to flag nets with modified wires and vias. This is useful when evaluating how many objects need to be modified for fixing DRC violations and then deciding whether to fix the violations manually or through ECO routing. The isEdit property is controlled through the -create_is_edit_flag parameter of setEditMode. By default, this parameter is set to 0. If you set the value of this parameter to 1, the isEdit property is set to 1 for nets with modified wires or vias.
