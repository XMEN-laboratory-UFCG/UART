.SH Name \fBsetResizeLine\fR \-  Sets the resize lines for shift-based floorplan resize option of the resizeFloorplan command
.SH Syntax \fBsetResizeLine\fR   [-help]  -clearAll   [-direction {H|V}]  [<points>]  [-width <float>]
.P Sets the resize lines for shift-based floorplan resize option of the resizeFloorplan command. The resize lines can be non-continuous though they must be orthogonal. If resize lines are specified, the floorplan will be resized between the area specified by the resize lines (for shift-based floorplan resize). To shrink or expand the floorplan in the horizontal direction, specify a vertical resize line. To shrink or expand the floorplan in the vertical direction, specify a horizontal resize line.
.P Each resize line can have multiple segments (for example, horizontal, vertical, and again horizontal) but it can only be applied to one direction. If you want to shrink or expand the floorplan in both directions, specify resize lines for each direction. You can create multiple resize lines. The resize lines are removed once the resizeFloorplan command is run. You can use this command after importing the design. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each setResizeLine parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:   man setResizeLine  "\fB-clearAll\fR" Clears all resize lines.  Data_type: bool, optional  "\fB-direction {H|V}\fR" Specifies whether the resize line is horizontal (H) or vertical (V).  Data_type: string, optional  "\fB<points>\fR" Specifies the resize line point list.  Data_type: pt list, optional  "\fB-width <float>\fR" Specifies the width of the resize line in microns. A positive value expands the floorplan and a negative value shrinks the floorplan.  Data_type: float, optional 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets a resize line with a width of 20 microns in the horizontal direction. As the width has a positive value, the floorplan will expand. The resize line is horizontal and will, therefore, expand the floorplan in a vertical direction.   setResizeLine -direction H -width 20 (1924 3476) (3807 3476)

.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets a resize line with a width of -20 microns in the horizontal direction. As the width has a negative value, the floorplan will shrink. The resize line is horizontal and will, therefore, shrink the floorplan in a vertical direction.   setResizeLine -direction H -width -20 (1924 3476) (3807 3476)

.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets a resize line with a width of -20 microns in the vertical direction. As a * has been specified for one of the coordinates, the value of that coordinate will be automatically derived.   setResizeLine -direction V -width -20 (2761 *) (2761 3810)
