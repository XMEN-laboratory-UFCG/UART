.TH reportTimingLib  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBreportTimingLib\fR \-  Reports the contents of the timing library
.SH Syntax  \fBreportTimingLib\fR  -outfile <fileName>  [-byLib]   [-all | -pin | -threshold | -sibling]  [-lib <library_name>]   [<cellName>] 
.P Reports the contents of the timing library. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-all | -pin | -threshold | -sibling\fR" Specifies the parameter for which the software should report the timing data.  -all prints all the pin properties, siblings of a cell, the libraries where they are defined, and the voltage.  -pin reports the pin properties, such as the pin name, direction, capacitance, max load, max fanout, and fanout load.  -threshold reports the input thresholds, output thresholds, and slew thresholds of a cell.  -sibling reports sibling cells, the libraries where they are defined, and the voltage.  Default: -all  "\fB-byLib\fR" Organizes the generated report by libraries. If you do not specify this parameter, the reportTimingLib command prints out cells with the same name together. Use this parameter to support multi-supply multi-voltage feature of the software, where you can define same cell names in more than one library with different voltage values and timing data.  "\fB<cellName>\fR" Specifies the individual cell name to be reported.  "\fB-lib <library_name>\fR" Reports a specified library.  If you do not specify this parameter, all the library names are reported.  "\fB-outfile <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the file to which the results are written. 
.SH Command Order
.P Use this command after importing the design when the timing library is also loaded. 
.SH Example
.P The following command reports the cell information in the timing library, and writes the results to the file xyz.dump.lib:
.P reportTimingLib -outfile xyz.dump.lib
