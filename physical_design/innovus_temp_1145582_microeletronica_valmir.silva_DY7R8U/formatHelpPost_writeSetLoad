.TH writeSetLoad  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBwriteSetLoad\fR \-  Writes the capacitive loading on each net to an output file
.SH Syntax  \fBwriteSetLoad\fR  [-help]  [-direct]  [-excludeZeroCap]  [-includePinCap]  [-wire_load]  [-view <viewName>]  -file <outFile> 
.P Writes the capacitive loading on each net to an output file. By default, the capacitance value does not include pin capacitance. You can set the load using the set_load command or else the software uses the load defined in the SPEF file. The latter is preferred for transferring parasitic information since the set_load command does not give full information regarding RCs.
.P You can use this command for dumping capacitance values for loading into third party tools. You can also use it for debugging, to examine cap load values for nets. But you can achieve this by other means such as using report_net and get_property commands, which does not require you to dump a file. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each writeSetLoad parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man writeSetLoad.   "\fB-direct\fR" Refers the ports directly for which the capacitive loading will be written. This option removes the dependency of using the get_nets command.  "\fB-excludeZeroCap\fR" Excludes the nets not annotated in the design while writing out the capacitive loading on each net to the output file.   "\fB-file <outFile>\fR" Specifies the name of the output file.  "\fB-includePinCap\fR" Includes the pin capacitance while writing out the capacitive loading on each net to the output file.  "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Specifies the view name to use for writing out the capacitive loading.  "\fB-wire_load\fR" Adds option '-wire_load' to "set_load" (i.e. set_load -wire_load) only on the output (out) and bi-directional (inout) ports in the output file. 
.SH Example
.P The following command writes the capacitive load in the report file load.rpt:
.P writeSetLoad -file load.rpt
.P The following report is generated:
.P set_load 1e-05 [get_nets {sig_out4000}]
.P set_load 0.00011 [get_nets {sig_in1000}]
.P set_load 0.00011 [get_nets {sig_in1001}]
.P set_load 0.00015 [get_nets {node_out6000}]
