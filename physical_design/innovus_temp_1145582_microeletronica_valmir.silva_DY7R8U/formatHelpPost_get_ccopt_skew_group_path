.TH get_ccopt_skew_group_path  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBget_ccopt_skew_group_path\fR \-  This command returns the path delay information for the specified skew group
.SH Syntax \fBget_ccopt_skew_group_path\fR  [-help]   [-check_type {setup | hold}]  [-delay_corner delay_corner]  [-delay_type {early | late}]  [-show_generator_paths]  -skew_group <skew_group_name>  [-longest  | -shortest]   [-summarize_stage_depth <cell_type_list>]  [-virtual_delays_only  | -real_delays_only]  [-wire_delays_only  | -cell_delays_only]   [-sink <pin> | -below <pin>]
.P This command returns the path delay information for the specified skew group. By default, this command returns the longest source-to-sink path in the specified skew group, which is the path with the largest delay. Paths are returned as a list of pins. You can use -shortest to return the shortest source-to-sink path rather than the longest.  
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help      \fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each get_ccopt_skew_group_path parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man  get_ccopt_skew_group_path.   "\fB-below <pin>\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will only consider paths below this pin.   "\fB-cell_delays_only\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will only consider cell delays (ignoring wire delays). By default both cell and wire delays are used to calculate delays.   "\fB-check_type {setup | hold}  \fR" Specifies whether the check type for the specified skew group should be setup or hold.  If a check type is specified, but the -delay_type parameter is not specified, the software behaves in the following manner:
.RS  "*" 2 -check_type -setup will mean -delay_type -late  "*" 2 -check_type -hold will mean -delay_type -early
.RE   Note: If a check type is not specified, the software will always look at what the views permit, preferring the setup view if there is a choice.  "\fB-delay_corner <delay_corner>  \fR" Specifies the delay corner to use when calculating delays. (use all_delay_corners to see all configured delay corners)  If this parameter is not specified, the software will use the delay corner specified using the CCOpt property, primary_delay_corner. However, if no valid delay corner is found, the software will error out.  Note: For detailed help on the CCOpt property, primary_delay_corner, run the following command:  get_ccopt_property -help primary_delay_corner  "\fB-delay_type {early | late}\fR" Specifies whether to use early or late half delays.  When early is specified, CCOpt uses only early path timing data to calculate path delay, for the clock edge specified. When late is specified, CCOpt uses only late path timing data to calculate path delay, for the clock edge specified.  Note: If the delay type is not specified but the check type is specified as setup, the software will consider the delay type as late. If the check type is hold, the software will consider the delay type as early.  "\fB-longest\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the longest path delay within the skew group. This is the default option.  "\fB-real_delays_only     \fR" Specifies that CCOpt will only consider the real path delays in the design. It will not include the virtual path delays added by trial CTS to resolve skew constraints.  "\fB-shortest\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the shortest source-to-sink path within the skew group (that is, the path with the smallest source-to-sink delay). By default, this command returns the longest path.  "\fB-show_generator_paths\fR" Specifies that CCOpt follows generated clock tree paths when determining the longest source-to-sink path. By default generated clock tree paths are not followed.  "\fB-sink <pin>\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the longest path to this pin for the specified skew group.   "\fB-skew_group <skew_group_name> \fR" Specifies the name of the skew group for which path information will be returned. This is a required parameter.   "\fB-summarize_stage_depth <cell_type_list>\fR" Specifies that the command will consider the number of cells of the specified type(s) in the tree, instead of considering delay. Possible values are buffer, inverter,logic, clock_gate, and generator. You can also specify * to include all cell types.  For example, the following command shows you the path with most buffers and inverters in the skew group, PM_HL_FUNC.  get_ccopt_skew_group_path -summarize_stage_depth {buffer inverter} -longest -skew_group m_dsram_clk/PM_HL_FUNC  Note: The * setting is not used in combination with any other cell type. For example, the below is not a valid setting.  -summarize_stage_depth {* buffer}   "\fB-virtual_delays_only   \fR" Specifies that CCOpt will return the shortest path delay or longest path delay only considering the virtual path delays (added by trial balancing) in the design and any user pin insertion delays applied before CTS. It will not include real path delays added by clustering buffers and existing cells in the design.  "\fB-wire_delays_only\fR" Specifies that CCOpt will only consider wire delays (ignoring cell delays). By default both cell and wire delays are used to calculate delays.
