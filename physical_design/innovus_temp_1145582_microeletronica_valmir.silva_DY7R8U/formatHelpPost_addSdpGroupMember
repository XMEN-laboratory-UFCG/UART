.SH Name \fBaddSdpGroupMember\fR \-  Adds an object or member to an existing structured data path (SDP) group
.SH Syntax \fBaddSdpGroupMember\fR  [-help]   -group <group_name>  -object <object_name_list>  [-orientation <orientStr>]  [-before <refObject> | -after <refObject>] 
.P Adds an object or member to an existing structured data path (SDP) group. The added object can be an instance or another SDP group.
.P The addSdpGroupMember command enables you to create a structured data path using TCL commands. You do not need to learn SDP relative placement format for creating a data path.
.P Before adding a member to an SDP group, you should have:
.RS  "*" 2 Imported the design
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Created an SDP group. For more information, see createSdpGroup.
.RE 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each addSdpGroupMember parameter.  For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man addSdpGroupMember.  "\fB-after <refObject>\fR" Adds the SDP group or object after the specified reference object.   "\fB-before <refObject>\fR" Adds the SDP group or object before the specified reference object.   "\fB-group <group_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the SDP group to which you are adding the member.  "\fB-object <object_name_list>\fR" Specifies the name of the object(s) to be added to the SDP group.  "\fB-orientation <orientStr>\fR" Specifies the orientation to be set for the object. You can specify orientation as one of the following: R0, R90, R180, R270, MX, MY, MX90, MY90  Note: If you do not specify this parameter, the object has R0 orientation (no rotation) by default. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following example adds the DTMF_INST/PLLCLK_INST instance to the SDP group sdpGrp1. The instance is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.   addSdpGroupMember -group sdpGrp1 -object DTMF_INST/PLLCLK_INST -orientation R90
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following examples adds two objects, DTMF_INST/tdsp_core_inst/inst1 and DTMF_INST/tdsp_core_inst/inst2, to the sdpGrp1 group.   addSdpGroupMember -group sdpGrp1 -object {DTMF_INST/tdsp_core_inst/inst1 DTMF_INST/tdsp_core_inst/inst2}
