.SH Name \fBanalyze_signal_resistance\fR
.SH Syntax \fBanalyze_signal_resistance\fR  [-help]  [-instance_pair_list_file <filename>]  -net <net_name>  [-output_dir <directory>]  [-report <filename>]  [-threshold <value>]  
.P Computes effective resistance for signal nets from a given instance1/pin1 to instance2/pin2 accounting all applicable manufacturing effects. You can use the effective resistance output file to determine whether the critical routes are within the specified resistance limits. 
.P 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs the command usage and a brief description about the command parameters.  "\fB-instance_pair_list_file <filename>\fR" Specifies the file name containing the signal net instance-pin pairs for which effective resistance needs to be computed.  The format of the file is:  INST1 PIN1 INST2 PIN2  "\fB-net <net_name>\fR" Specifies the name of the signal net.   "\fB-output_dir <directory>\fR" Specifies the name of the output directory.  "\fB-report <filename>  \fR" Specifies the name of the report file in which details of effective resistance between instance-pin pairs are written.    "\fB-threshold <value>\fR" Specifies the minimum allowed effective resistance between instance-pin pairs.     
.SH Examples
