.TH set_wire_load_model  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBset_wire_load_model\fR \-  Specifies the wire load model to be used from the technology library, and sets the wire load model on the design or on a hierarchical object (instance)
.SH Syntax \fBset_wire_load_model\fR    [-help]   [<list_of_instances_or_ports>]   [-library <library_name>]  [-max]   [-min]  -name <wireload_model>
.P Specifies the wire load model to be used from the technology library, and sets the wire load model on the design or on a hierarchical object (instance). If the list of instances is not specified, the wire load model is set on the current instance. Otherwise, the wire load model is set on all the specified instances or ports.
.P Use wire load models for estimating delays before the actual wire loads are back annotated. A technology library contains different wire load models, previously computed based on the analysis of several designs differing in area. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-library <library_name>\fR" Specifies the technology library to use when searching for the name of the wire load model. You can specify a library name, or a collection of libraries.  Default: All technology libraries are searched.  "\fB<list_of_instances_or_ports>\fR" Specifies the list of objects - designs, ports, or hierarchical instances.  "\fB-max\fR" Sets the wire load model only for the maximum PVT (process, voltage, temperature) corner.    Default: The specified wire load model applies to all three PVT corners if neither the -min nor the -max parameter is specified.  "\fB-min\fR" Sets the wire load model only for the minimum PVT (process, voltage, temperature) corner.   Default: The specified wire load model applies to all three PVT corners if neither the -min nor the -max parameter is specified.  "\fB-name <wireload_model>  \fR" Specifies the name of the wire load model in the library. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the COM3_LV_WLM_0.0 wire load model from the COM3_LV_WIRE library on the current module for all PVT corners:  set_wire_load_model -library COM3_LV_WIRE -name COM3_LV_WLM_0.0
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the B1X1 wire load from the lca500kv library on the clk1 port for the minimum PVT corner:   set_wire_load_model -library lca500kv -min -name B1X1 clk1
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 The following command sets the 3M_TO_4500Kwire load from the c13tsmc_slow2s108v125c library on the current module for the minimum PVT corner:   set_wire_load_model -library c13tsmc_slow2s108v125c -min -name 3M_TO_4500K
