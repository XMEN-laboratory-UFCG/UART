.SH Name \fBrcOut\fR \-  Reads the parasitic database and outputs the parasitics in the Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF)
.SH Syntax \fBrcOut\fR  [-help]   [-excludeIlm]  [-noRes]   [-useEEQCellWithLibertyInfo]  {{{-spef <fileName>}[-excNetFile <fileName> | -net <fileName> | -netName <list_of_nets>]}}  [-view <viewName> | -rc_corner <rcCornerName>]  [-cUnit {pF fF}] 
.P Reads the parasitic database and outputs the parasitics in the Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF). 
.SH Parameters   "\fB-help\fR" Outputs a brief description that includes type and default information for each rcOut parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:  man rcOut.   "\fB-cUnit <unit>\fR" Specifies the unit of capacitance as fF or pF in the output SPEF file.  Default: pF  "\fB-excludeIlm\fR" Writes out only the top-level SPEF while excluding the ILM parasitics.  Note: When this parameter is specified, the top cell-name is suffixed in the SPEF output filename.  For example, if test.spef is the name of the SPEF file and top_cell_name is the cell-name, then when you run below command:  rcOut -spef test.spef -excludeIlm  The output SPEF filename will be:  test.spef.top_cell_name  "\fB-excNetFile <fileName>  \fR" Specifies the name of the file that contains nets to be excluded from the output file.  "\fB-net <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the input file that contains the net names to be extracted.  Default: Extracts all net names  "\fB-netName <list_of_nets>\fR" Specifies the names of the nets to be written in the SPEF file.  Default: Writes all nets  "\fB-noRes\fR" Generates a SPEF file without the resistance information. The SPEF file generated by this parameter can only be used to improve the performance of third-party simulator tools in early stages of the design.  Caution: Most tools expect the resistance information to be present in the SPEF file for performing extraction. Therefore, SPEF files with no resistance information should not be used with Ostrich for RC correlation.  "\fB-rc_corner <rcCornerName>\fR" Specifies the RC corner that is used to generate the parasitic output file in the multi-corner flow.   "\fB-spef <fileName>\fR" Specifies the name of the SPEF output file.  If you add
.gz as a suffix, the rcOut command automatically compresses the generated file.  "\fB-useEEQCellWithLibertyInfo\fR" Writes EEQ master cell in case the EEQ cells are present.   "\fB-view <viewName>\fR" Specifies that the RC corner associated with the specified view is used to generate the output SPEF file in the multi-corner flow. 
.SH Examples
.RS  "*" 2 Use any of the commands listed below to read the parasitic database created during RC extraction and write parasitic information for two nets for corner1 in SPEF format to the specified file:   rcOut -spef spefFile -rc_corner corner1 -netName [ list net1 net2 ]  OR rcOut -spef spefFile -rc_corner corner1 -netName {net1 net2}  OR  rcOut -spef spefFile -rc_corner corner1 -netName "net1 net2"
