.SH Name \fBget_lib_pins\fR
.SH Syntax \fBget_lib_pins\fR  [-help]  [-filter expr]   [-regexp]   [-nocase]  [-quiet]   {<pattern_list> | -of_objects <object_list>} 
.P Creates a collection of library cell pins from the loaded libraries whose name matches the supplied pattern list. Assign these library cell pins to a variable or pass them to another command. If no objects match the criteria, an empty collection is returned. 
.SH Parameters    "\fB-help\fR" Prints out the command usage.   "\fB-filter <expr>\fR" Filters the collection with the specified expression. For any library cell pins that match the pattern, the software evaluates the expression based on the attribute of the library cell pin.  You can filter library pins using any of the library pin properties supported through the get_property command.  "\fB-nocase\fR" Specifies that pattern matching is not case sensitive.  Note: You must specify -regexp in order to use this parameter.  "\fB-of_objects <object_list>\fR" Creates a collection of all library pins associated with the specified library cells or pins. You can specify a list of cells or a list of pins, but you cannot specify a list that contains both cells and pins. You can specify patterns for the cell or pin names, a collection of cells or pins, or a combination of patterns and a collection.  "\fB<pattern_list>\fR" Returns only those libraries in the collection whose name matches one or more of the patterns specified in the <pattern_list> argument. The characters ? and * are wild cards; The ? character matches any one character while the * character matches zero or more characters. If a library cell matches multiple patterns, it appears multiple times in the collection.  A pattern can have only two hierarchical separator characters, dividing the pattern into one, two, or three parts. If the hierarchical separator is /, the alternatives are:
.RS  "*" 2 <pin_name_pattern>  Selects all pins whose name matches the <pin_name_pattern> from all cells in the libraries.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 <cell_name_pattern>/<pin_name_pattern>  Selects all pins whose name matches the <pin_name_pattern> from all cells whose name matches the <cell_name_pattern> in all libraries.
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 <lib_name_pattern>/<cell_name_pattern>/<pin_name_pattern>  Select all pins whose name matches the <pin_name_pattern> from all cells whose name matches the <cell_name_pattern> from all libraries whose name matches the <lib_name_pattern>.
.RE   "\fB-quiet\fR" Suppresses all error and warning messages generated when the get_lib_pins command is run.  "\fB-regexp\fR" Treats the specified patterns as a regular expression patterns.  Default: Treats the specified pattern as a wild card
