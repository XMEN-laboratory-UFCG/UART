.SH  
.SH Plot Types    "\fBPlot Type\fR" Description  "\fBac\fR" Available/feasible capacitance (Farad)  Displays the feasible decoupling capacitance that can be added in the area. The feasible capacitance in the area is calculated based on the filler cells placement. The program matches the placed filler cells with the decap cells available in the power-grid library and computes the feasible capacitance. The capacitance of the decap cell is stored in the power-grid library.  "\fBactivity\fR" Displays the worst activity for the output and inout pins of every instance.   "\fBcap\fR" Grid capacitance (Farad)  Plots the capacitance of the extracted power-grid network.  "\fBdd\fR" Decoupling capacitance (decap) density (Farad/um 2 )  Plots decap density of the design. The decap density is the cell internal decoupling capacitance in the unit area (m 2 ).  "\fBdr\fR" Decoupling capacitance required  Reports the decoupling capacitance required to fix dynamic IR-drop violations. This option suggests how much decap needs to be added in a given area to fix the IR-drop violations. The voltage threshold used to determine the IR-drop violations for this analysis is the value specified by the -threshold option of the set_pg_nets command.  "\fBivdn\fR" Instance Voltage Drop (Volts) - net-based  Plots the net-based instance voltage drop.  "\fBivdn\fR" Instance Voltage Drop (Volts) - domain-based  Plots the domain-based instance voltage drop. For domain based, at least one power and one ground net must be selected.  "\fBfd\fR" Filler cell density (1/m 2 )  Displays the filler cell density per unit area (m 2 ). The plot can be used to analyze the feasibility of adding decap cells by replacing the filler cells and not changing the placement of the logic cells.  "\fBfreq\fR" Frequency domain (Hz)  Displays the associated clock frequency of all instances in the design. The instances associated with multiple clock domains are displayed using the fastest clock frequency. This plot can be used to analyze and debug the power distribution in the design.  "\fBip\fR" Instance total power (mW)  The total power consumed by each instance is displayed. The total power is the sum of the internal, switching and leakage power of the instance. The power data is read from the power database and can be specified using the -power_db option or it is queried directly from memory, if power calculation is run during the session.  "\fBip_i\fR" Instance internal power (mW)  The power consumed by charging and discharging of the internal interconnect and device capacitances of the instance.  "\fBip_l\fR" Instance leakage power (mW)  The power consumed by devices when not switching.  "\fBip_s\fR" Instance switching power (mW)  The power consumed by charging and discharging of the interconnect or output load.  "\fBipd_i\fR" Specifies internal power density in mW/um 2
.  "\fBipd_l\fR" Specifies leakage power density in mW/um 2
.  "\fBipd_s\fR" Specifies switching power density in mW/um 2
.  "\fBipd_t\fR" Specifies total power density in in mW/um 2
.  "\fBip_tr\fR" Displays toggle rates for all instances. The toggle rate for an instance is calculated as the average of toggle rates of all outputs of the instance.  This plot allows you to determine the design area that toggles more than the others.  "\fBir\fR" IRdrop or voltage drop (Volts)  Displays the IRdrop across each extracted power-grid segment in the design.  "\fBjrms\fR" Specifies current density as j/jmax based on the Irms current. This plot is only supported for dynamic analysis.  A jrms gif file will be saved in the state directory that shows where the Irms based EM violation occurred. This plot type allows you to verify the analysis results of "jrms" using the GUI.  "\fBload\fR" Loading capacitance (Farad)  Displays the output loading capacitance driven by the instance. This plot can be used to analyze and debug the regions with high switching power.  "\fBpi\fR" Power-switch (gate) current violation: I/Idsat  Displays the ratio of current through the power-switch and the saturation current (Idsat) of the power-switch.  This plot can be used to analyze and debug whether the current through power-switches exceeds the saturation current characterized for the power-switch devices. The saturation current and on-resistance of the power-switches are characterized and stored inside the power-grid library of the power-switch cell. A ratio of greater than 1 means that the current requirement of the power-gated block can not be met with placed power-switch instance. Either the power-switch needs to be made larger or power-switch instances need to be added.  "\fBpv\fR" Voltage drop across power-switch (Volt)  Displays the IRdrop across power-switch instances.  This plot can be used to analyze and debug the IRdrop inside the power-gated block, e.g. if the IRdrop across power-switches is already high, the IRdrop inside the power-gated block will be much higher. In this case, the power-switch placement will have to be refined in order to resolve the IRdrop problem.  "\fBrc\fR" Resistor current (Amp)  Displays the current across power-grid resistor segments.  This plot can be used to analyze and debug how the current flows from the voltage sources into the rest of the design, e.g. high current should flow from pads to the top-level routing level layers and then to the lower level metal layers. This plot can also be used to debug current density violations (rj).  "\fBrlrp \fR" The total resistance of the instance along the least resistive path.  Displays the total resistance of the instance along the least resistive path, meaning the resistance of the instance along the path from where it gets the most amount of current. This plot can be used to analyze and debug the power-grid integrity early in the design stage. An instance with high resistance is likely to have high static or dynamic IRdrop depending on the vector that is simulated later in the design cycle. This plot can be also used during decap optimization, since regions with high dynamic IRdrop and high resistance may not be improved upon by adding decaps, because the effectiveness of decoupling capacitance depends on the resistance of the power-grid network.  You can also highlight the least resistive path of the instance using the GUI and selecting the instance with left mouse button. The RLRP Path checkbox should be enabled.  "\fBres\fR" Displays the total resistance of the least resistive path from each node to voltage source.  This plot can be used to view high resistance regions of the power-grid. It is useful during IRdrop and decap analysis to identify weak power-grid connectivity.  "\fBrj\fR" Resistor current density, J/Jmax.  Displays the current density (current per unit area) violation on each power-grid segment using the ratio of calculated current density and maximum allowed current density. A ratio of greater than 1 means that the current density limit of the segment is violated. The current density limits are supplied by the foundry and can be read during analysis using the set_rail_analysis_mode -em_models command.  "\fBrs\fR" Specifies the plot type for resistor sensitivity.  "\fBslack\fR" Instance slack (Seconds)  Displays worst instance slack. The slack data is queried from either the timing database or if the power database is specified using -power_db option, then the worst slack data is read from the power database. When using an external TWF, the slack data is read from the TWF.  "\fBtc\fR" Tap current (Amp)  Displays the current consumed by the instance devices or current taps. During rail analysis, it is based on the power consumption of the instance and is distributed inside the cell. The current distribution inside the cell is based on the extracted device netlist stored inside the power-grid library of the cell. The current distribution is generally based on the device width, length, and spice models.  This plot can be used to analyze and debug IRdrop inside the macro.  "\fBtd\fR" Transition density (Hz)  Displays the worst transition density (activity * frequency) of the instance. This plot can be used to analyze and debug activity distribution and high power density regions.  "\fBtpd\fR" Displays power density map with user-specified grid size.   "\fBunc\fR" Unconnected segments  Displays power-grid segments that are disconnected from the voltage source (power pads).  This plot can be used to debug unusually high IRdrop in the region.  "\fBvc\fR" Voltage source current (Amp)  Displays current through the voltage sources (power pads).  This plot can be used to analyze the current carrying capacity of the power-pad.  "\fBvu\fR" Voltage drop across package (Volt)  Displays voltage drop across package. If analysis is run with package model attached to the power pads, this plot displays the IRdrop due to package RLCK elements.
