.P Type: Integer
.P Default: 0
.P Specifies that the input file is a shape-based DEF. DEF file generated by shape-based router may contain overlapping routing. By default, defIn drops any overlapping wire segment. Set this variable to 1 if you want defIn to consider overlapping wire segments.
.P If the router of a segment of a metal is connected with the two other segments of the same metal, defInShapeBasedDefFile will consider this as "overlapping" metals. For example, the metal5 segment of net A is connected with different length of other metal5 segments of net A. This connection will be considered as overlapping metals.
