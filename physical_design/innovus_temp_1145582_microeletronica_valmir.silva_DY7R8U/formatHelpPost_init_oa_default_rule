.TH init_oa_default_rule  22.14 "Fri Oct 06 02:12:27 2023" 
.SH Name \fBinit_oa_default_rule\fR \-  Specifies a constraint group name at the start of Innovus session
.SH Syntax \fBinit_oa_default_rule\fR <ruleName> 
.P Specifies a constraint group name at the start of Innovus session. The name provided would be used by Innovus for reading the place-and-route technology rules from the constraint group.
.P If the user specified constraint group is not found, Innovus outputs an error during init_design. If no value is specified for init_default_oa_rule, Innovus falls back to the default look-up mechanism for LefDefaultRouteSpec constraint group used by any place-and-route tool. Follow these guidelines while using this parameter:
.RS  "*" 2 You can set this parameter only at the start of Innovus session or after running freeDesign.  "*" 2 You will need to resolve conflicts in a design arising due to the two incompatible constraint groups used in two design runs in two different Innovus sessions.
.RE
.P The specified constraint group must have the following:
.RS  "*" 2 Valid layers
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Valid vias
.RE
.RS  "*" 2 Width
